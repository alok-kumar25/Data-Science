Unlocking the science of E Ink displays: Why we believe they must catch on,That e-reader screen isn't magic - it's E Ink! We break down the science behind these paper-like displays.,"With their crisp, paper-like screens, e-readers like the Kindle are a pleasure to read on. But how do these E Ink displays actually work, and what makes them different from your phone or laptop screen? We unlock the science behind these ingenious displays and explore why E Ink still hasn’t conquered all our screens despite its advantages.
What are E Ink displays and how do they work?
E Ink displays are a special type of screen technology often used in e-readers like the Amazon Kindle. The technology was originally developed in the 1990s at MIT and is now owned by E Ink Corporation.
The screens work using tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black ones suspended in fluid inside the display. By applying positive or negative electrical charges to different areas of the screen, the white or black particles can be made to rise to the surface, creating the text and images on the display.

Unlike LCD and LED displays that use a backlight, E Ink displays reflect light – just like paper. This makes them easier on the eyes for long reading sessions. They also require very little power since they don’t need a backlight and only use energy when the image changes. The lack of backlighting also means that they are easier to read under brighter lighting conditions, which isn’t the case with LCD/LED displays at all – legibility actually takes a hit under bright sunlight.
How is E Ink different from E Paper?
E Ink and E Paper may sound like the same thing, but they actually refer to different display technologies. E Paper is a broad term for any display designed to mimic the appearance of real paper. Meanwhile, E Ink is a specific type of E Paper display that uses millions of tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid.

An excellent example of a device with an E Paper display but not an E Ink display is the Pebble smartwatch. This cool gadget uses a low-power LCD with a reflective layer to look like paper, which is a very different implementation from E Ink.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of E Ink displays?
E Ink displays have several key advantages that make them well-suited for certain applications. First, they consume very little power compared to LCD and OLED displays. An E Ink display only draws power when the image is changed, meaning it can display a static image for weeks or months without needing a charge. This makes it ideal for e-readers and other devices meant for long battery life.

Second, E Ink displays cause less eye strain for the user. The lack of a backlight and the paper-like visual experience mean users can read on an E Ink device for hours without fatigue. The matte surface and high contrast also make them easily readable outdoors and under bright light.

However, E Ink displays also have some downsides. The biggest is their slow refresh rate compared to LCD and OLED displays. While improvements have been made, such Ink displays still take much longer to refresh, making them unsuitable for video or animation. E Ink also has limitations on colour and resolution compared to other display technologies. And the niche nature of E Ink manufacturing means the displays remain expensive, especially in larger sizes. This limits their use to mostly e-readers and a handful of other products where their particular advantages outweigh higher cost.
Therefore, for the majority of display applications demanding speed, responsiveness and high resolution, LCDs and OLEDs remain superior to E Ink alternatives. But for a subset of use cases valuing long battery life, outdoor visibility and eye comfort, they retain unique benefits over other display tech.
What are the uses of E Ink displays?
E Ink first hit the scene in the early 2000s and was all the rage among e-readers like the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and Sony Reader. Folks loved it because the text was super clear even in bright sunlight. You can still find E Ink displays on Kindle and Kobo e-readers today, though other screen tech has taken over much of the e-reader market.

E Ink made brief appearances in a few early cell phones before getting replaced by fancier displays. But with its easy reading and lower distraction factor, some startups are exploring E Ink in smartphones. A cool example is the BlackBerry-like Minimal Phone, currently crowdfunding, which aims to cut down screen time and help users focus on communication and productivity.

Beyond mobile devices, E Ink is popping up around a few cities on stuff like bus stop displays and walking direction signs. Some restaurants are using E Ink menu boards too. Unlike glossy LCDs that create glare and reflections, such displays feature a matte surface that’s more natural-looking and readable at angles and under different lighting.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/e-ink-displays-why-they-should-catch-on-9129270/,technology

Nintendo Switching things up? Leaks suggest larger 8″ screen for next-gen console,Rumour has it the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 will be equipped with a sizable 8-inch LCD screen.,"Rumours are heating up that Nintendo may unveil a successor to its popular Switch console later this year. According to a new prediction by Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase, the so-called “Nintendo Switch 2” could launch in 2024 with an 8-inch LCD screen, representing a sizable increase over the 6.2-inch and 7-inch displays found on the original Switch and Switch OLED models respectively.
Hayase based his forecast on supply chain research focused on small and medium sized displays. He believes demand from Nintendo for larger screens suitable for a Switch successor will cause shipments of amusement displays to double next year.
Neither Nintendo nor its partners have officially confirmed the existence of a Switch 2. However, Bloomberg has reported that Hayase is not alone in predicting an upgraded Nintendo console to hit shelves in 2024.
Speculation around a new Nintendo platform has swirled for many months, with signs pointing to its unveiling this year. There are reports that Nintendo privately showcased the Switch 2 to developers at Gamescom 2023.
Details on the Switch 2’s technical specifications remain uncertain and conflicting. Some leaks point to a new Nvidia Tegra processor, while others expect Nintendo to use an 8nm chipset from Samsung rather than a 5nm node.
The Switch 2 is expected to support 4K visuals and run at 60 frames per second, a significant boost over the original Switch’s max 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second target. Breath of the Wild 2 and tech demos based on Unreal Engine 5 are rumoured to have already been tested on prototype Switch 2 developer hardware.
Of course, fans eagerly awaiting the next generation of Nintendo gaming will have to wait for official word direct from Nintendo before getting too excited. But analysts clearly believe the company is poised to capitalise on the original Switch’s success with new hardware in 2024.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/nintendo-switch-may-get-8-inch-screen-lcd-screen-9129128/,technology
Epic’s Fortnite and new browser engines show cracks in Apple’s walled garden,The EU's antitrust regulations are forcing Apple to open iOS to competition like Fortnite and alternate browser engines.,"Apple is continuing to open up iOS to comply with new regulations from the European Union. Not only is the company enabling alternate browser engines on iOS for the first time ever, but Epic Games has also announced the eventual return of Fortnite to the platform.
Epic Games revealed it plans to launch the Epic Games Store on iOS devices and bring Fortnite back to the platform later this year, but only in Europe. Fortnite has been unavailable on iOS since 2020 when it was banned for violating App Store policies around in-app purchases.
The return of Fortnite marks a major shift for Apple’s traditionally closed ecosystem. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney described Apple’s new rules allowing third-party app stores as “hot garbage” but said the company will take advantage of them regardless.
The rules stem from the EU’s Digital Markets Act intended to rein in anti-competitive behavior from major tech companies like Apple. Part of the regulations require that users have the ability to uninstall pre-installed apps like Safari.
Complementing this change, iOS 17.4 will for the first time allow alternate browser engines beyond just Apple’s own WebKit. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge have historically been forced to run on WebKit for iOS due to Apple’s restrictions.
Now, with iOS 17.4 which rolls out next month, developers can apply to use alternate engines like Chromium and Gecko. This will enable full functionality and extension support for third-party browsers available on iOS in Europe.
Both these developments represent a blow to the walls of Apple’s walled garden. While falling short of fully opening iOS, they demonstrate Apple bending its strict App Store policies in order to comply with the DMA.
ADVERTISEMENT
The DMA aims to give users more choice over their devices and create a more level playing field between Apple and small developers. Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney said these goals are undermined by the restrictions Apple still has in place like its commission on in-app purchases.
Nonetheless, the return of Fortnite and availability of alternate browsers are milestones in increased competition on iOS. It remains to be seen whether Apple will expand these allowances globally in the face of similar regulatory pressure elsewhere. For now, European iOS users will enjoy options long desired but forbidden by Apple’s tight control over its ecosystem.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/epic-fortnite-return-browser-engines-apple-ios-9129067/,technology
Hubble finds water vapour on small exoplanet in landmark discovery,Scientists have used the Hubble Space Telescope to discover the presence of water on a distant exoplanet. This makes GJ 9827d the smallest exoplanet where we have discovered water.,"Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to find evidence of water vapour in the atmosphere of the planet GJ 9827d. Even though the planet is twice as wide as the Earth, it is the smallest exoplanet where astronomers have found evidence of water so far.
The Max Planck Institute for Astronomy announced the discovery on Thursday. “This would be the first time that we can directly show through atmospheric detection, that these planets with water-rich atmospheres can actually exist around other stars. This is an important step toward determining the prevalence and diversity of atmospheres on rocky planets,” said research team member Björn Benneke in a press statement.
But before you jump the gun and imagine the possibility of life on the planet, do note that it is as hot as Venus, which will make a Delhi summer pale in comparison. What is important about the discovery is that the aging Hubble was used to determine the presence of water on such a (relatively) small exoplanet, opening up many new avenues for scientists.
But on the other hand, it is still too early for the scientists to conclude whether Hubble measured a small amount of water vapour on a planet with a puffy hydrogen-rick atmosphere or if the atmosphere itself is mostly made of water that was left behind a primeval hydrogen/helium atmosphere that evaporated in the intense radiation of a star.
But since the planet is around six billion years old and so close to its host star, scientists are leaning towards the latter possibility since it should have lost most of its primordial hydrogen due to stellar radiation.
In the end, the research team is left with two possibilities — either the planet is still clinging to its hydrogen-rich atmosphere, which will make it a mini-Neptune; or it is a warmer version of Jupiter’s moon Europa, which has twice as much water as our planet under its crust.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/hubble-exoplanet-water-9128948/,technology
James Webb Space Telescope takes stunning image of stars being born,"The James Webb Space Telescope captured this stunning image of a ""star-forming factory"" in deep space.","The James Webb Space Telescope took this stunning image of a star-forming nebula called N79, which is a region of ionised interstellar atomic hydrogen. The nebula is in the H II region of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and was captured by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).
N79 is simply a humongous star-forming celestial region that spans around 1,630 light-years and is in the southwest region of LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). It is regarded as the younger version of the Tarantula Nebula (officially known as 30 Doradus). However, scientists estimate that N79 has a star formation efficiency that far exceeds the Tarantula Nebula.
This image, in particular, focuses on one of three giant molecular clouds complex called N79 South or S1. The star-shaped pattern that you can see here is a series of diffraction spikes. Just like most other telescopes, Webb uses a mirror to collect light. The design of the mirror on the telescope causes this artifact.
The six largest “star spikes” that you can see in the image are caused by the hexagonal symmetry of the Webb telescope’s 18 primary mirror segments. These sorts of patterns are usually most visible around very bright and compact objects where a lot of light comes from the same place. Even though most galaxies appear very small to our eyes, they are much more spread out than a single star and thus do not cause this pattern.
This particular image centres on one of the three giant molecular cloud complexes, dubbed N79 South (S1 for short). The distinct ‘starburst’ pattern surrounding this bright object is a series of diffraction spikes. All telescopes that use a mirror to collect light, as Webb does, have this form of artifact that arises from the design of the telescope. In Webb’s case, the six largest starburst spikes appear because of the hexagonal symmetry of Webb’s 18 primary mirror segments. Patterns like these are only noticeable around very bright, compact objects, where all the light comes from the same place. Most galaxies, even though they appear very small to our eyes, are darker and more spread out than a single star, and therefore do not show this pattern.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/james-webb-space-telescope-n79-9128830/,technology
OpenAI fixes ‘lazy’ GPT-4 Turbo model and drops pricing,OpenAI slashes prices for GPT-3.5 Turbo and boosts GPT-4 Turbo performance.,"OpenAI has released several updates to its AI models and pricing, marking the latest in a series of incremental improvements by the research company. The changes include lower pricing for its popular GPT-3.5 Turbo model, a performance boost for GPT-4 Turbo, and upgraded text embedding models.
Most notably, OpenAI has cut the per-token pricing of GPT-3.5 Turbo by 50% for input and 25% for output. This model powers applications like ChatGPT and serves as an industry benchmark for conversational AI. Lower prices make the API more accessible for developers building text-intensive products that require analysing documents or books. With open-source models catching up to OpenAI, reduced pricing helps retain customers.
GPT-3.5 Turbo also gains a new version 0125 with unspecified “improvements.” Since the last iteration was 0613, some may have expected more details on advancements from OpenAI.
For GPT-4 Turbo, a new preview model 0125 arrives that OpenAI says “completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly” to reduce “laziness” where the model avoids finishing work. This fix aims to boost performance on technical tasks compared to previous versions. GPT-4 with vision capabilities remains in preview but will launch more broadly in coming months.
On the technical side, upgraded text embedding models provide better semantic representations of language for researchers and engineers.
While not earth-shattering, OpenAI’s latest tweaks reflect the company’s iterative approach to enhancing its AI lineup.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-fixes-lazy-gpt-4-model-and-drops-pricing-9128794/,technology
Road ends for NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter due to rotor damage,"NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was the first to prove that powered, controlled flight is possible on worlds other than Earth but it can no longer carry on with its mission because of damage to its rotors.","NASA on Thursday said its history-making Ingenuity Mars Helicopter’s mission has come to an end after its rotor blades took on damage during landing. It was originally designed as a technology demonstration to complete five test flights over 30 days but it far exceeded that expectation by completing 72 flights over a period of three years.
“The historic journey of Ingenuity, the first aircraft on another planet, has come to end. That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best – make the impossible possible. Through missions like Ingenuity, NASA is paving the way for future flight in our solar system and smarter, safer human exploration to Mars and beyond,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a press statement.
The rotorcraft landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, secured within the Perseverance rover. It took off on its first flight on April 19 that year, marking the first time that any aircraft achieved powered controlled flight on a world other than Earth. It dispatched its next four flights quickly as well, completing its original mission. After that, NASA engineers began using Ingenuity as an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover.
Fast forward to 2024, the Ingenuity team at the space agency was planning to make a short vertical hop on January 18 to determine its exact location after an emergency landing during a previous flight. Telemetry data showed that it achieved its maximum altitude of 12 metres and hovered for 4.5 seconds before it started descending with a velocity of about one metre per second.
But once the helicopter was about a metre above the surface, it lost contact with Perseverance. Since Perseverance acts as a communication relay between the helicopter and Earth, this meant that mission controllers lost touch with the rotorcraft. Communications were reestablished the following day.
Images of Ingenuity taken by Perseverance reveal revealed the damage to the rotorblade but the reason for the communication dropouts and the orientation of the rotorcraft at the time of touchdown are still being investigated to find out exactly what happened.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-9128734/,technology

"Google introduces Lumiere, a multimodal AI video model: Is this the future of filmmaking?","Google recently dropped its AI text-to-video model, Lumiere. The results are putting existing models to the test.","Google just announced its latest AI video model that is capable of creating realistic, diverse, and coherent motion. Known as Lumiere, the latest offering from Google is a text-to-video and image-to-video model. In simple words, you input text or image and the AI neural networks translate it into a video. Based on recent reports, Lumiere is much beyond the simple text-to-video functionality.
The tool allows users to animate existing images, and create videos in the format of an input image or painting. It also allows video in painting and creating specific animation in sections within an image.
How does Lumiere create videos?
Google’s research titled ‘Lumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation’ offers the scientific details behind Lumiere. “We introduce Lumiere – a text-to-video diffusion model designed for synthesizing videos that portray realistic, diverse, and coherent motion – a pivotal challenge in video synthesis. To this end, we introduce a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, through a single pass in the model,” reads the opening lines of the abstract.
ICYMI | Best AI tools of 2023: ChatGPT rules the roost, followed by Google Bard, Midjourney, and more
The main innovation here is the SpaceTime Diffusion model that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once. In contrast, existing AI video models synthesize distant key frames one at a time. With Lumiere, Google aims to offer global temporal consistency ensuring coherent representation across different frames.
In the research paper, the capabilities of Lumiere have been demonstrated through various examples. Based on the output, the text-to-video results show some promising consistency and accuracy in portraying diverse scenes. Meanwhile, the image-to-video transformations too seem to show impressive animations. Further, the model’s stylised generation using reference images also produces visually appealing and coherent results.
Lumiere text-to-video demo as cited in the research paper.
According to the researchers, the text-to-video generation framework has been introduced using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion. Since existing methods were struggling with globally coherent motion, the team addressed this by deploying a space-time U-Net architecture that directly generates full-frame-rate video clips, incorporating spatial and temporal modules. Resultantly, their approach showed superior results in image-to-video, video inpainting, and stylised generation.

Why does it matter?
In the paper, the team compares the performance of the AI model with other state-of-the-art models in the industry that are known for their superior performance in text-to-video and image-to-video generation. Based on the results, Lumiere seems to outperform in terms of video quality as well as text alignment.
While this model may create a buzz with its incredible capabilities, its potential use case could essentially be enabling individuals to create Hollywood-style slick movies with ease. The AI community has been exploring how these models could generate images and videos and the development of world models for advanced simulations. Lumiere seems to be paving way for more advancements and research. It is a significant leap in AI-driven video synthesis, offering vast creative possibilities. The consistent and realistic results displayed in the examples indicate the potential for transformative advancements in the field of AI-generated content.
In conclusion, the team stated that their primary goal in this work is to enable novice users to generate visual content creatively and flexibly. They admitted that there is a risk of misuse for creating fake or harmful content with this new technology. “We believe that it is crucial to develop and apply tools for detecting biases and malicious use cases to ensure safe and fair use,” read the research paper.
It needs to be noted that as of now, there is no way to access or download Lumiere. However, experts feel that Lumiere will enhance Google Bard’s multimodal capabilities in the future. There is so far no official acknowledgment that the AI model will be integrated into Bard.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-google-lumiere-multimodal-ai-video-model-9128622/,technology
"Microsoft to lay off 1,900 staff from gaming division, CEO Phil Spencer calls it painful",The CEO in a memo said that the layoffs were intended to minimise areas of overlap.,"It seems there will not be any respite for tech professionals anytime soon, as layoffs continue unabated. Tech giant Microsoft is the latest to announce layoffs, the company is reportedly sacking around 1,900 people from its gaming division. According to a memo accessed by CNBC, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said that the layoffs were intended to minimise areas of overlap. The gaming division had a strength of 22,000.
In the memo, Spencer has been reported to describe the layoffs as painful. He went on to say that those directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and the Xbox teams. He added that they should all be proud of everything that they have accomplished in the Gaming division.
The CEO also said that the company is planning to invest in areas that will grow the business and support its strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world. Incidentally, the latest development comes after Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard known for titles such as ‘World of Warcraft’, ‘Call of Duty’, ‘Spyro’, etc.

Spencer, while acknowledging the contribution of the team members, also assured that they will be offered full support during the transition including severance benefits as informed by local employment laws. He added that the roles that will be impacted will be notified. Spencer also urged the teams to treat their departing colleagues with respect and compassion, something which according to him has been consistent with the brand’s values.
Meanwhile, as part of the layoffs, Mike Ybarra, president of Blizzard Entertainment announced his departure from the company. Ybarra joined Blizzard in 2019. “To the incredible teams at Blizzard – thank you. Words can’t express how I feel about all of you. You are amazing. Continue to do incredible things and always keep Blizzard blue and the player at the forefront of every decision,” Ybarra said in his long post on X.

Meanwhile, Blizzard’s chief design officer co-founder Allen Adham is also developing. Reportedly, Microsoft’s gaming teams have already been marred by significant cuts in budgets even before the layoffs took place.
The gaming segment has had several layoffs in the last few weeks. Earlier, this week, Riot Games was reported to have laid off 530 employees and shut down its publishing arm Riot Forge. Earlier this month, Lost Boys Interactive, a Gearbox-owned video game developer with 400 employees fired a sizable portion of the company.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/microsoft-lays-off-1900-gaming-division-9128550/,technology

"Meta moves to protect teens from unwanted messages on Instagram, Facebook",The move comes weeks after the WhatsApp owner said it would hide more content from teens.,"Meta Platforms is building more safeguards to protect teen users from unwanted direct messages on Instagram and Facebook, the social media platform said on Thursday.
The move comes weeks after the WhatsApp owner said it would hide more content from teens after regulators pushed the world’s most popular social media network to protect children from harmful content on its apps.
The regulatory scrutiny increased following testimony in the U.S. Senate by a former Meta employee who alleged the company was aware of harassment and other harm facing teens on its platforms but failed to act against them.
Meta said teens will no longer get direct messages from anyone they do not follow or are not connected to on Instagram by default. They will also require parental approval to change certain settings on the app.
On Messenger, accounts of users under 16 and below 18 in some countries will only receive messages from Facebook friends or people they are connected through phone contacts.

"Bill Gates is excited about rapidly advancing robotics, says it won’t be taking all jobs",The billionaire philanthropist took to his blog to share his thoughts on robotics and how it can transform the way we live and work in the future.,"Robotics is the next frontier in technology. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence in recent times have accelerated the integration and deployment of AI. Numerous companies around the world have integrated AI into their robots that have been developed for various use cases. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, who is a vocal proponent of AI, took to his blog to share his thoughts about the advancements in robotics technology.
In his post, Gates expressed his excitement about the rapid progress in robotics technology and the potential for robots to transform how we live and work. While the billionaire outlined some limitations, he also stated that the innovations in AI are enabling them to demonstrate human-like capabilities in domains such as learning, understanding, and thinking.
The 68-year-old believes that robots can undertake dangerous and unfulfilling jobs, making people safer, healthier, and more productive. He went on to highlight some of the robotics companies that are at the forefront of developing humanoid robots that can seamlessly interact with humans. He also sees the possibility for robots to be active in healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and even in homes in the future.
On robots taking jobs
Gates acknowledged the fear of robots taking over jobs; however, he feels that governments and the private sector will need to help people brave this transition.

“I understand concerns about robots taking people’s jobs, an unfortunate consequence of almost every new innovation—including the internet, which (for example) turned everyone into a travel agent and eliminated much of the vacation-planning industry. If robots have a similar impact on employment, governments and the private sector will have to help people navigate the transition,” he wrote.
The billionaire said that considering the shortages in the economy and the dangerous and unrewarding nature of certain jobs, robots are unlikely to take jobs that we love, and more likely, they will take over jobs that people are unwilling to do. “I believe it’s less likely that robots will replace us in jobs we love and more likely that they’ll do work people don’t want to be doing. In the process, they can make us safer, healthier, more productive, and even less lonely.”
The limitless possibilities
When it comes to robotics, Gates feels if the technology is used the right way, there would be limitless use cases. According to Gates, robots can help during natural disasters where first responders would have to risk their lives or during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic when human interactions may spread the disease further. Robotics can help in manually pulling out weeds from farms instead of toxic chemical herbicides. They can also help move massive loads on factory floors. They can also be beneficial in prosthetics.

Gates went on to list some of the robotics companies that are doing something remarkable. In Agriculture, Tevel’s fruit-picking robots can work round the clock to address labour shortages and prevent crop wastage. Similarly, Apptronik is developing general-purpose humanoid robots that can be programmed to do various tasks. UCLA’s RoMeLa lab has developed ARTEMIS, one of the world’s fastest-running robots. Startups like Field AI are focused on developing AI software to improve robots’ perception, navigation, and communication abilities.
Gates, who frequently shares his thoughts on AI, had, in a recent interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that generative AI had plateaued and that GPT-5 will not be much different. In the same interview, the Microsoft co-founder also predicted that in the next two to five years, the accuracy of AI software will witness a considerable increase along with a cost reduction. This will lead to the creation of new and reliable applications.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/bill-gates-on-robotics-artificial-intelligence-9127474/,technology

The Minimal Phone channels BlackBerry vibes with keyboard and E Ink display,This phone is a throwback taking aim at distraction-free productivity.,"The smartphone world is dominated by big, colourful touchscreen devices like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. But a new crowdfunded phone called the Minimal Phone is going back to basics with a throwback design featuring a physical keyboard and black and white E Ink display.
Minimal Phone is the creation of Minimal Company, which plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign in early February to manufacture at least 3,000 units. The company says the phone’s final design is complete and aims to ship the device later this year if funding goals are met.
This isn’t your typical smartphone. Instead of a bright LCD or OLED screen, Minimal Phone uses a power-friendly monochrome E Ink display like you’d find on an e-reader. This provides easy outdoor readability and uses less electricity, allowing the phone’s 4,000 mAh battery to last up to 4 days on a charge according to Minimal Company.

The tradeoff is that an E Ink display isn’t ideal for video or motion-heavy games. It’s not like you’ll not be able to play those at all, but the display technology is definitely not suited for such use. However, for those looking to minimize distractions and focus on communication and productivity probably wouldn’t need support for it anyway. The Minimal Phone is meant to offer digital detox while still providing smartphone capabilities, after all.
Despite the minimalist aesthetic, founder Andre Youkhana says the phone will have modern features like a touch-enabled E Ink screen, camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, global cellular connectivity, and Android OS with Google Play support. The company is also exploring 5G capabilities.
At 120 x 72 x 10mm, the phone has a compact form factor reminiscent of older BlackBerry designs thanks to its full QWERTY keyboard. This physical keyboard complements the E Ink display for efficient typing and messaging.
Minimal Phone’s pared-down MinimalOS comes preloaded with a curated set of apps focused on productivity and privacy. With prices starting around $400 (Rs 33,250), it aims to provide core smartphone functionality at an affordable price point for the niche audience seeking a simpler mobile experience.

That said, the Kickstarter launch will determine if there’s enough interest to put the Minimal Phone into production. There’s even a chance it may never go into production at all if the funding needs aren’t met or an unexpected snag gets in the way – but we’re hoping it all goes smoothly.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/minimal-phone-distraction-free-e-ink-display-9127118/,technology

"NASA, Boeing plan to send astronauts on Starliner spacecraft this April",The much delayed first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner is now being planned for mid-April.,"After years of delays, NASA said on Wednesday it is planning to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station on a Boeing Starliner spacecraft no earlier than mid-April.
The space agency says significant progress has been made in resolving technical issues that were identified during the spacecraft’s flight certification process. Starliner went through a successful drop test earlier this month. Teams from NASA and Boeing are conducting the final analysis of the data to complete overall system certification ahead of its first crewed flight.
NASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 to develop crew transport systems to carry astronauts into space. Boeing was awarded a $4.2 billion contract, while SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion. Elon Musk-led SpaceX completed its first crewed flight in 2020, and it has carried more than a dozen crewed flights to the space station since then, along with many cargo flights. Boeing, meanwhile, has only completed two uncrewed flight tests of Starliner.
In the background, Boeing completed the removal of over seven kilograms of the P213 tape that could pose a fire risk in some conditions. In parts of the spacecraft where removing the tape could lead to other hardware issues, the company overwrapped the P213 tape with a different non-flammable, chafe-resistant tap and installed fire breaks on wire harnesses.
Major integrated flight operations exercises are also underway with mission support teams recently completed a two-day undocking to landing mission dress rehearsal at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-crewed-flight-9127033/,technology

Tesla will start making new EV model in second half of 2025,"The EV maker also warned of ""notably lower"" sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.","Tesla expects to start production of its long-anticipated, next-generation electric vehicle at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday.
But Tesla shares were down 6.5% in premarket trading as Musk noted that ramping up production of the new vehicle would be challenging and Tesla also warned of sharp slowdown in sales growth this year before the new model launch. Musk said it would take “a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology” required – a sign that any boost to Tesla’s declining pace of growth would take time.
His projection followed a Reuters story earlier in the day saying Tesla had told suppliers to prepare for a June 2025 startup of a smaller crossover vehicle, critical for the automaker as it loses share to inexpensive EVs such as those made by China’s BYD.
“I’m often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in the second half,” Musk told analysts on a post-earnings call.

“We’ll be sleeping on the line practically,” he said, referring to Tesla’s factory in Texas, where the new model will be first produced. That will be followed by Mexico and another factory outside North America to be decided later this year, he said.
The EV maker also warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.
Tesla said it was in between two growth waves: one driven by the release of Models 3 and Y in 2017 and 2020, respectively, and a second wave that would start with the next-generation vehicle platform.

Wall Street expects Tesla to sell 2.2 million vehicles this year, according to Visible Alpha. That would be up about 21% from 2023 but well below the long-term target of 50% that Musk set about three years ago. Tesla, however, did not reiterate that target on Wednesday.
After years of breakneck growth, Tesla is bracing for slowing growth and margins as EV demand softens and competition intensifies.
“If volume’s going to be lower, then my guess is, Musk will probably cut prices and take share. Margins may continue to struggle for a while,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at shareholder Hodges Capital Management.
Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially in the fourth quarter, but Tesla cautioned it was approaching “the natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup,” underscoring the pressure on the company to launch its new lower-cost vehicles. BYD sold more EVs globally than Tesla in the fourth quarter.

Musk said Chinese automakers will have significant success outside of China. “If there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”
Tesla reported a gross margin of 17.6% for the three months ended December, compared with 23.8% a year earlier, and analysts’ average estimate of 18.3%, according to LSEG data.
Automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits – a closely watched figure – dropped to 17.2% from 24.3% a year earlier, although it improved from 16.3% in the third quarter.
“Today’s flat sales and substantially reduced margin results are further evidence that Tesla is losing its leadership advantage and its brand leadership has weakened,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand.

MORE PRICE CUTS?
Tesla slashed prices of its cars since late 2022, igniting a price war that singed U.S. rivals including Ford, who have all slowed EV production.
Musk said on Wednesday that Tesla’s margins will depend on how fast interest rates fall.
Its stock, which has enjoyed valuations of a technology company partly due to Musk’s promise of self-driving cars, has fallen 16% so far this year, after doubling in 2023
“I don’t think the price cuts are over, mainly for the reason that demand for its electric vehicles is still weak,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Net income more than doubled from the previous year to $7.9 billion, including a $5.9 billion noncash gain related to deferred tax assets. Tesla said lower raw material costs and U.S. government credits helped lower cost-per-vehicle, but Cybertruck production and AI and other research projects increased costs.
On an adjusted basis, Tesla earned 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter, missing an average analysts’ estimate of 74 cents, according to LSEG data.
Tesla’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 3% to $25.17 billion, which marked its slowest pace of growth in more than three years.

Spotify to start in-app purchases on iPhone in Europe after DMA takes effect,"Under the DMA, which all Big Tech firms must comply with by March 7, companies are obligated to treat their own products and services like they do rivals'.","Spotify users in Europe can start to buy audiobooks and subscription plans from within the music-streaming app from March as a result of the region’s new competition law for Big Tech, the Swedish company said on Wednesday.
The move will help the company avoid Apple’s 30% fee for purchases through its App Store, which has long been a source of contention between app developers and the tech giant.
Spotify has for years been embroiled in a legal battle, alleging that it was forced to raise the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs tied to Apple’s App Store rules.
U.S.-listed shares of the Stockholm-based company rose around 2%.

“For years Apple had these rules where we couldn’t tell you about offers, how much something costs, or even where or how to buy it,” Spotify said in a blogpost.
“The DMA (Digital Markets Act) means that we’ll finally be able to share details about deals, promotions, and better-value payment options in the EU.”

Apple plans to challenge the European Union’s decision to put all of App Store into the bloc’s new digital antitrust list, Bloomberg News had reported in November.
On Tuesday, Apple asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit worth around $1 billion brought on behalf of more than 1,500 app developers over its App Store rules.
Apple had also drawn criticism from Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg who called App Store policies and fee structure as problematic and causing a conflict of interest.
“We’ve always been interested in helping developers distribute their apps, and new options would add more competition in this space,” Meta said on Wednesday.

How to pick the best smart projector for gaming and entertainment,Why buy a television when you can get a projector instead? Here are a few reasons why the latter is a smarter choice.,"There is a misconception that projectors aren’t meant for home entertainment and that’s due to two reasons — the price and the space required to project an image.

However, buying a projector is still a confusing process, especially considering the huge variety of projectors available in the market. Here is a simple guide on how to pick the right smart projector that fits your needs.

Asus bets big on ‘AI PCs’ to drive growth in India,Asus also says that reaching customers across India's towns/cities is key to company's growth. It's now present in 600 out of 750 districts with 250+ exclusive stores in the country.,"The buzz around artificial intelligence PCs is growing louder by the day, thanks largely to Microsoft’s big push for these next-gen laptops and desktops. But what exactly are AI PCs and how critical will they be for the future of personal computing? According to Arnold Su, vice president of consumer and gaming PCs at Asus India, AI PCs are the new cutting edge but will become standard in the next 5-10 years.
“From a business perspective, what we are looking at AI PCs is similar to the evolution of smartphones 10-12 years ago. Back then, smartphones were treated as a novelty just like how AI PCs are viewed today. But now, nobody talks about smartphones anymore. They are just phones. Similarly, 5-10 years down the line, AI PCs will just become PCs with AI features being standard,” said Su.
Asus is already beginning to integrate basic AI capabilities into its laptop lineup. “What you have seen right now and you will see with our upcoming launches is, we have enhanced our camera technologies and we’ve also enhanced our noise cancellation capabilities. The integration of all these systems we have started in 2021 itself and now with the new chips and new applications building in, we will continue to enhance the customer experience from that. And going forward, you will have more stuff to look forward to,” noted Su.
The ‘AI PC’ trend was kicked off earlier this year by Microsoft, which introduced a dedicated ‘Copilot’ key on its PCs. Other brands are expected to follow suit. (Image: Microsoft)
However, Asus’ current AI integration focuses more on things like computer vision and audio processing rather than bleeding-edge generative AI abilities seen in models like ChatGPT. When asked if Asus has any specific plans to build proprietary generative AI tools, Su did not divulge much. “I can’t talk about future plans at the moment, but currently we are working with multiple partners and we look forward to what we can achieve internally and then we’ll bring the best stuff out for the customers,” he hinted.
While the PC market declined in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, Asus India managed to buck the trend and record strong growth. Su believes reaching customers across India through online and offline channels is key to Asus’ success.
“Because India is such a big country, making every product available is very important. So from the PC market point of view, there are three major verticals in India – online space, large format retailer, and the traditional channel. We make our products available through online platforms, large format retail stores as well as the traditional channel which still accounts for 50% of the market. We have partner shops in over 400 districts currently where customers can experience our laptops first-hand before buying. This experience is critical and sets us apart,” explained Su.
Asus now has over 250 exclusive stores across India covering 600 out of 750 districts. The goal is to expand to more towns and cities to stay the second-largest PC brand in India.
ADVERTISEMENT
In Su’s words, “In Q3 2022, Asus became the number two consumer PC brand in India for the first time, overtaking HP. For 2023, we want to secure this second spot. We will continue focusing on bringing the latest tech across India’s towns and cities.”
This focus on India is not just lip service but core to Asus’ global market strategy. “India is always the first wave country for any new Asus product launch globally. It is our first priority within the company,” emphasised Su.
Contrary to the belief that entry-level devices drive volumes in India, Su has realised that Indian consumers are willing to spend more for better experiences.
“Over the years, we’ve seen Indian customers prefer mainstream and premium laptops over entry-level options. When they invest in a device, they want the satisfaction of having bought the latest tech that meets their needs, regardless of the price point,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Asus will continue to focus on bringing cutting-edge yet practical innovation to consumers across segments, without fixating on any particular form factor or specification.
“We launched gaming two-in-ones, dual screen, foldable, and handheld gaming PCs last year. There may not be one definitive laptop form factor in the future. As a PC innovator, we will keep bridging the gap between users’ needs and devices,” concluded Su on what customers can expect from Asus moving forward.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/asus-ai-pc-focus-india-growth-9125693/,technology

Watch: Asteroid burns up over Germany hours after it was discovered,Watch videos of a small asteroid as it hurtled towards Earth and burned up in the atmosphere.,"Early on Sunday morning, a tiny asteroid hurtled towards Earth, entered its atmosphere and exploded in a ball of fire above Nennhausen in Germany, west of Berlin. The asteroid was harmless, and researchers detected it three hours before impact.
Such asteroid entries usually happen a few times a year, but this one was special because it was detected before it hit, according to Live Science. This is only the eighth time that scientists have spotted one of these asteroids before it hit the planet’s atmosphere. “Heads Up: A tiny asteroid will disintegrate as a harmless fireball west of Berlin near Nennhausen shortly at 1:32 AM CET. Overseers will see it if it’s clear!,” shared NASA’s Asteroid Watch team on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday.
When the asteroid arrived, it was far from inconspicuous and social media was flooded with videos of the asteroid’s descent over Europe. Denis Vida, a PhD associate in meteor physics at Western University in Canada, shared this video of the asteroid that was captured by a camera livestreaming from the Augustusplatz square in the city of Germany.
Here’s the full video of the asteroid #Sar2736, a ~1 m object that broke up some 50 m west of #Belin, #Germany, and probably dropped some meteorites on the ground. Video credit: https://t.co/72o6ZzPNz8 pic.twitter.com/PA73dkqid1

This year was no exception, and fans of the brand have been keeping track of the OnePlus 12 for a few weeks now. But will the phone push the envelope enough when it comes to specs and experiences to keep the OnePlus devotees happy? Read in our review of the OnePlus 12.
OnePlus 12 review
At first look, the OnePlus 12 has a trademark with the round Hasselblad camera module, alert slider on the left and curved-edge front display. But the Flowy Emerald colour we got for review this time feels very different from anything we have seen before. This marble-like finish somehow blends with nature and still stands out in the crowd. The phone feels heavy but still offers a good grip. The round camera module at the back gets a full glass cover which protects the lenses, but I ended up feeling the glass cover itself might need some protecting.

"Disney inventor demoes HoloTile floor, a system that lets you walk around in Virtual Reality","Lanny Smoot, an inventor at Disney Research recently demonstrated a new technology called 'HoloTile Floor', which lets people walk on it without having to worry about crashing into walls when walking in Virtual Reality.","Lanny Smoot, an inventor at Disney Research, has presented a new solution that aims to solve the problem of running into walls or obstacles when walking in Virtual Reality. Dubbed ‘HoloTile Floor’, the solution involves a system that consists of hundreds of small round tiles placed close to each other.
“I can walk on this omni directional floor in any direction I want”, says Smoot in a video on YouTube. He also claims that the HoloTile floor also supports multiple people walking on it at the same time in different directions. From what we can tell, these tiles are seemingly working together to create a sort of multidirectional treadmill that prevents the person(s) standing on it from leaving the pad.

"‘Zombie viruses’ in the Arctic could trigger the next pandemic, warns experts","Experts warn that ancient ""zombie viruses"" could be released as Artcic ice thaws, causing the next pandemic.","We haven’t quite recovered from the last one, but experts now say that humanity could be faced with the threat of the next pandemic from an unlikely place — the melting permafrost in the Arctic region could release ancient viruses that could potentially affect humans.
These “zombie viruses,” also called Methuselah viruses after the biblical figure, have already been isolated by researchers who have raised concerns about a new global emergency, according to The Observer. To counter the potential of diseases from the distant past coming back to haunt us, scientists are proposing an Arctic monitoring network that could pinpoint early cases of a disease caused by ancient micro-organisms.

Ingenuity was completing its 72nd flight on Mars on January 18. That was a quick pop-up vertical test flight to check the helicopter’s systems after an unplanned early landing during the previous flight. The Perseverance rover acts as a relay between the helicopter and Earth and sends back data indicating that it climbed to its assigned maximum altitude of 12 metres.

‘League of Legends’ developer Riot Games cuts 11% of its workforce amid market challenges,"The job cuts at Riot Games come days after big tech heavyweights, including Google and Amazon, have confirmed layoffs across multiple divisions.","Riot Games, the creators behind League of Legends and Valorant, announced on Monday that they are laying off 11% of their staff, approximately 530 jobs. This move aligns with other major game developers and tech companies that are scaling back certain divisions as part of belt-tightening plans due to rising costs.
“Over the past few years, as Riot more than doubled in headcount, we spread our efforts across more and more projects without sharp enough razors to decide what players needed most,” Riot Games CEO Dylan Jadeja wrote in a blog post. “The adjustments we’re making aim to focus us on the areas that have the greatest impact on your experience while reducing investment in things that don’t.”

"Samsung Galaxy S24 vs Apple iPhone 15: Two great base model flagships, but which one is for you?",Confused between the recently launched Galaxy S24 and the iPhone 15? Here's a quick comparison between the two compact flagship devices.,"While most of us might want phablet-sized phones, there are a handful of people interested in a compact phone that offers flagship features at a much lower price compared to their high-end counterparts. If you are confused between the Apple iPhone 15 and the Samsung Galaxy S24, here’s a quick comparison that might help you decide between the two.
Design and display
The vanilla models in the Galaxy S24 series as well as the iPhone 15 series feature a flat display with an aluminium frame, which is pretty much in line with their predecessors. However, they differ significantly when it comes to design. On the front, you get a punch-hole display on the Galaxy S24 while the iPhone 15 borrows the Dynamic Island from the iPhone 14 Pro series.

CD Projekt aims to start production phase of ‘Polaris’ in 2024,"CD Projekt did not give a premiere date for the first game in the project, but analysts expect it to debut in 2026 or 2027.","Polish video game maker CD Projekt aims to start the production phase of the next game in its blockbuster “Witcher” series this year, the company’s new joint CEO Adam Badowski told Reuters.
“We’d like to have around 400 people working on the project by the middle of the year”, Badowski said.
Badowski, a company veteran, took the helm at CD Projekt along with Michal Nowakowski at the start of the year.
The project, called “Polaris”, is a new trilogy expanding the universe of the “Witcher” medieval fantasy franchise, which has sold over 75 million copies since the first game was released in 2007.
CD Projekt did not give a premiere date for the first game in the project, but analysts expect it to debut in 2026 or 2027.
That leaves the company without major game release in the next couple of years.
After a bug-ridden launch of another game “Cyberpunk 2077” in late 2020, CD Projekt has been focused on transforming its studio. It has announced plans for several new games and said in October that Cyberpunk’s sales had exceeded 25 million copies.
ADVERTISEMENT
A sequel to Cyberpunk, code-named “Orion”, is in the conceptual phase, Badowski said. CD Projekt expects to have about 80 people working on the project by the end of the year.
Nowakowski added the company was considering including multi-player elements, but would not discuss details.
He said wage pressures had eased and the company expected hiring in its Polish studios to be “rather low”, but it would continue expanding its North America studio.
He added CD Projekt had formed a team to look into how it could use AI.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We think that AI is something that can help improve certain processes in game production, but not replace people,” he said.
Speaking about lessons learnt from Cyberpunk’s release, Badowski said the company now had better control of the game production process.
“We believe that in the future we’ll avoid a premiere like the one we faced with Cyberpunk 2077”, Badowski said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/cd-projekt-aims-to-start-production-phase-of-polaris-in-2024-9122186/,technology

"Four astronauts, including Turkey’s first, arrive at space station","Both the Crew Dragon vessel and the Falcon 9 rocket that carried it to orbit were supplied, launched and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX under contract with Axiom, as they were in the first two Axiom missions to the ISS since 2022.","A four-man crew including Turkey’s first astronaut arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) early on Saturday for a two-week stay in the latest such mission arranged entirely at commercial expense by Texas-based startup company Axiom Space.
The rendezvous came about 37 hours after the Axiom quartet’s Thursday evening liftoff in a rocketship from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
Both the Crew Dragon vessel and the Falcon 9 rocket that carried it to orbit were supplied, launched and operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX under contract with Axiom, as they were in the first two Axiom missions to the ISS since 2022.
Once the astronauts reach the space station, they fall under the responsibility of NASA’s mission control operation in Houston.
The Crew Dragon autonomously docked with the ISS at 5:42 a.m. EDT (1042 GMT) as the two space vehicles were flying roughly 250 miles (400 km) over the South Pacific, a live NASA webcast showed.
Both were soaring in tandem around the globe at the hypersonic speed of about 17,500 miles per hour (28,200 km/h) as they joined together in orbit.
With coupling achieved, it was expected to take about two hours for the sealed passageway between the space station and crew capsule to be pressurized and checked for leaks before hatches can be opened, allowing the newly arrived astronauts to move aboard the orbiting laboratory.
ADVERTISEMENT
Plans call for the Axiom-3 crew to spend roughly 14 days in microgravity conducting more than 30 scientific experiments, many of them focused on the effects of spaceflight on human health and disease.
The multinational team was led by Michael López-Alegría, 65, a Spanish-born retired NASA astronaut and Axiom executive making his sixth flight to the space station. He also commanded Axiom’s debut mission – the first all-private voyage to the ISS – in April 2022.
His second-in-command for Ax-3 is Italian Air Force Colonel Walter Villadei, 49. Rounding out the team are Swedish aviator Marcus Wandt, 43, representing the European Space Agency, and Alper Gezeravcı, 44, a Turkish Air Force veteran and fighter pilot, making his nation’s first human spaceflight.
They will be welcomed aboard ISS by the seven members of the station’s current regular crew – two Americans from NASA, one astronaut each from Japan and Denmark and three Russian cosmonauts.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since its founding eight years ago, Houston-based Axiom has carved out a business catering to foreign governments and wealthy private patrons aiming to put their own astronauts into orbit. The company charges at least $55 million per seat for its services organizing, training and equipping customers for spaceflight.
Axiom also is one of a handful of companies building a commercial space station of its own intended to eventually replace the ISS, which NASA expects to retire around 2030.
Launched to orbit in 1998, the ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000 under a U.S.-Russian-led partnership that includes Canada, Japan and 11 countries belonging to the European Space Agency.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/four-astronauts-including-turkeys-first-arrive-at-space-station-9120431/,technology

Samsung’s Galaxy AI features may not stay free forever,"The Galaxy S24 has some futuristic AI skills, but Samsung is already planting seeds to charge users down the road.","Samsung made a big splash this week with the unveiling of its new Galaxy S24 lineup, touting the phones’ ample AI capabilities like real-time translation and object removal in photos. However, the company conveniently left out one key detail – these futuristic features may eventually come at a cost to consumers.
As spotted by Android Central, the fine print on Samsung’s website indicates the AI features will be free until the end of 2025 for supported Galaxy devices. After that, Samsung leaves the door open to start charging users, stating “Galaxy AI features will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices. Different terms may apply for AI features provided by third parties.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/samsungs-galaxy-ai-features-may-not-stay-free-forever-9118994/,technology

Climate change could be making diarrhoea more common,A new study found that climate change could potentially make diarrhoeal illnesses more common.,"You are probably acutely aware of how climate change is wreaking havoc on our planet but did you know that it also poses a great threat to your plants? A new study from the University of Surrey revealed that climate change is linked to the increased spread of a particular diarrhoeal illness.
The study published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology investigated how weather affected the transmission of campylobacteriosis, which is a bacterial infection that can cause diarrhoea and stomach pains. Campylobacter infections are the most common causes of human gastroentitis in the world, according to the World Health Organisation. Infections are usually mild but they can prove to be fatal to young children, the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals.
“Since Hippocrates, there has been a large consensus that weather and climate influence the spread of diseases. Getting to the bottom of why this is and what specific environmental factors drive the spread of disease is a complicated matter and not fully understood. We now have a detailed description of how the weather affects the disease, and the next step is to understand the why. Importantly, through our transparent and conceptually simple approach, we can now tell the risk of getting the disease when we know the recent local weather,” said Giovanni Lo Iacono, co-author of the study, in a press statement.
This is important because apart fromn causing discomfort to people, campylobacteriosis has massive societal impacts. It can have an effect on the economy when people are forced to call in sick to work and can also put extra pressure on health services across the world, especially in the parts where the systems are already stretched thin.
The researchers analysed data from around one million cases where people were infected by the bacteria over a 20-year period. The team then used a special mathematical model to compare this data with corresponding weather data. They found that campylobacteriosis infections remained consistent at temperatures of around eight degrees Celsius.
But there was a sharp increase in infection observed for every five-degree increase in temperature between eight and 15 degrees Celsius. They also observed high incidents of infection when humidity was between 75 to 80 per cent.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/climate-change-diarrhoea-more-common-9118615/,technology

"Rabbit R1 and other ‘AI-first devices’ are in the pager era, far from replacing our smartphones yet","It’s refreshing to see devices like the Rabbit R1 and the Humane AI Pin that have ambitions to change the status quo and offer a different take on smartphones, but they are still in the infancy stage, mimicking how the pager once was.","“The smartphone was supposed to be intuitive, but with hundreds of apps on your phone today that don’t work together, it no longer is.” Jesse Lyu, the CEO and founder of AI startup Rabbit took a dig at the bigwigs of the mobile industry during the introduction of the pocket-sized companion device, R1, at the recently-concluded CES 2024.
The announcement video has been viewed over 4.6 million times since then, and pre-orders for three production runs of the R1 handheld AI device have been sold out. In fact, the Rabbit R1 is already hailed as the most exciting product since the iPhone by the Internet, and while it remains to be seen whether the pocket AI companion device is worth the hype, the irony is that the R1 is a complete opposite of what an iPhone did to smartphones and the app ecosystem that followed. Instead, the R1 takes us back to the golden age of pagers, before cell phones and smartphones became a thing, in the hope of creating a new generation of AI-first hardware devices that are entirely voice-based and have nothing to do with apps.

Mark Zuckerberg’s grand vision for ‘open-source’ AGI raises concerns,"In an Instagram Reel, the Meta CEO shared his vision for AGI. His announcement has added fuel to the raging debate surrounding AGI.","It is now confirmed that Meta has joined the fray to make Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) a reality. Earlier, San Francisco-based AI start-up OpenAI had outlined its plans for how all of its AI projects are leading up to AGI. For the uninitiated, AGI is several steps above what we call AI today and will possess the ability to understand and apply tasks at the level of the human brain. Now, the big question is regulation, who gets to control AGI? This has been a matter of contention ever since the term AGI surfaced in the public realm.
Even as OpenAI and other tech giants are working clandestinely towards their goal of AGI, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg seems to have laid out his plans for all to see. In an Instagram reel, Zuckerberg announced that his company wants to invest billions into building an open-source version of AI.

Japan’s ‘Moon Sniper’ follows Chandrayaan-3 to make historic landing but suffers major issue,"Japan's ""moon sniper"" SLIM mission landed successfully on the Moon making the country only the fifth to do so. But now, the lander's solar cells do not seem to be working, putting the mission in jeopardy.","The club of countries that can soft-land spacecraft on the Moon is continuing to grow, with Japan being the latest addition. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on Friday confirmed that its Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) successfully landed on the Moon’s surface at 8.50 PM IST on Friday. Despite the successful landing, the “Moon Sniper” has a major issue — its solar cells are not generating power.
With the landing, the list of countries that have soft-landed a spacecraft on the Moon now has five members — the United States, the erstwhile Soviet Union, China, India and Japan. “SLIM is now operating only on its battery, and we are prioritising the transfer of its data onto earth”, Hitoshi Kuninaka, the head of JAXA’s research centre, told a press conference, reported Reuters.

"Greenland glaciers lost more ice than previously estimated, says NASA study",NASA says Greenland's glaciers have lost much more ice than previously estimated and this could hold-term consequences for ocean water levels.,"The ice sheet in Greenland lost about one-fifth more ice mass in the last forty years than previously estimated, researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in South California reported in a new paper published on Wednesday.
Icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate, and a majority of the glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly. However, the additional ice loss only has an indirect impact on sea levels, but it could have massive implications for ocean circulation in the future.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/greenland-glacier-ice-loss-nasa-9117567/,technology

Google slipping? New study finds decline in search result quality,New study suggests Google is losing search quality as low-value SEO spam creeps into top results.,"Google has long dominated the world of online search. However, a new study suggests that the search giant may be slipping when it comes to providing users with quality results.
Researchers from Leipzig University, Bauhaus-University Weimar, and the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence recently completed a year-long study analysing search results from not just Google but Bing and DuckDuckGo as well. The study looked specifically at product review searches – an area of increasing concern. The results confirm what many frequent searchers have noticed: the top results for product queries are increasingly littered with low-quality content from sites focused on gaming search algorithms.

Google to lay off more employees in 2024: Tech industry headed for major upheaval?,"Sundar Pichai, in a memo to staff, said that Google is set to have more layoffs. What’s behind the big decision and how will it impact the tech industry?","With the barrage of tech layoffs, the year started on a rather patchy note. Now, one of the biggest of all, Google has asked its employees to brace themselves for impending layoffs. In the initial weeks of January, the Alphabet Inc. company laid off thousands across vertices. Subsequently, in a memo, the CEO Sundar Pichai said that more job roles will be impacted going forward.
“We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year…The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices,” read the memo as reported by The Verge. The 51-year-old said that some of the layoffs this year were intended to “remove layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas.” However, he also indicated that this year’s eliminations will not be at the scale of the previous year, where the company sacked close to 12,000 employees from various domains.

The company said in a statement that the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 model smartwatches will start going on sale on Thursday, reported Reuters. The company has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Masimo, which manufactures medical devices, ever since the International Trade Commission (ITC) in October found that its smartwatches had sensors that infringed upon Masimo’s patents.

Galaxy S24 Ultra vs S23 Ultra: How Samsung’s top-end phones stack up,How does the Galaxy S24 Ultra stack up against last year's model? Our in-depth comparison has the verdict.,"Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S series sees its latest iteration with the new Galaxy S24 Ultra, succeeding last year’s S23 Ultra. While retaining the S series DNA, Samsung has made subtle but meaningful upgrades to the S24 Ultra’s design, display, performance, camera, and software capabilities. But are these incremental improvements compelling enough for S23 Ultra owners to upgrade? Let’s find out.
Design
The design evolution from the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra to the new S24 Ultra is subtle. While retaining the recognisable tall, rectangular shape with ever-so-slight rounded edges, the S24 Ultra trims a wee bit of fat, shaving off 2 grams of weight for a total of 232 grams. It also slims down by 0.3mm to 8.6mm thickness.

Cloned rhesus monkey reaches adulthood for the first time: His name is ReTro,Scientist say they have cloned a rhesus macaque for the first time and it has survived to adulthood.,"Chinese scientists on Tuesday announced that they have cloned a Rhesus monkey that lived to adulthood. Two-year-old ReTro has made it to adulthood and this is the first time the species has been cloned.
The scientists created ReTro using a slightly modified version of the approach used to create Dolly the Sheep and other mammals like the long-tailed macaque, which was the first primate to be cloned. They replaced the placenta of the cloned embryo with that produced by a different kind of embryo to reduce developmental issues that can affect survival while using fewer embryos and surrogate animals, according to CBS News.

Pegasus spyware now detectable on iOS with this Kaspersky technique,Kaspersky researchers have revealed a new way to detect advanced iOS spyware like Pegasus using your iPhone's system logs.,"A new method for detecting sophisticated iOS spyware has been developed by researchers at Kaspersky. The Russian cybersecurity firm revealed that they have created a lightweight technique to identify infections from advanced iOS malware such as Pegasus, Predator and Reign.
Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) found that by analysing the Shutdown.log file in an iOS device’s sysdiagnose archive, traces of infections can be detected. The Shutdown.log retains information from every device reboot, so anomalies linked to spyware like Pegasus become visible if a compromised phone is restarted.

Indian tectonic plate that causes Himalayas to grow could be splitting Tibet,"Tibet might be splitting in half as the Indian continental plate crashes into the Eurasian plate, causing the Himalayas to grow.","The Indian tectonic plate’s movement causes the Himalayas to grow but the same process may also be tearing apart Tibet into two, geophysicists have discovered.
It was already understood that the Himalayas are growing because the Indian and Eurasian continental tectonic plates are colliding under the mountain range, according to LiveScience. Usually, when two tectonic plates collide, the denser one usually slides beneath the other in a phenomenon called subduction. However, since the two continental plates are similarly dense, geoscientists are not quite sure which plate is going to end up on top of another.

Apple to sell some watches without blood oxygen feature after US court ruling,"Apple stopped selling its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the U.S. before Christmas until the appeals court's temporary pause. The devices remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon.com, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart.","Apple said on Wednesday it would remove a blood oxygen monitoring feature from two flagship Apple Watch models in the U.S. as the iPhone maker fights a legal battle over patents on the technology behind the feature.
The legal fight could take a year to resolve, and analysts had expected Apple would strike the feature, which is marketed for fitness uses, rather than pull devices from sale in one of its biggest markets.
The company said Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models without the feature would go on sale on its website and stores starting at 6 a.m. Pacific Time (1400 GMT) on Thursday
Apple shares closed 0.5% lower at $182.68 after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on Wednesday the company could no longer sell the models at the center of a the legal battle with medical technology company Masimo.
In December, Masimo secured a decision from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to halt imports of the devices. Apple Watches comprise about a quarter of the global smartwatch market, according to Counterpoint Research.
In a statement, Joe Kiani, Masimo’s founder and chief executive, said the court ruling on Wednesday “affirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American inventors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others’ patents.”
Apple said it “strongly disagreed” with the ITC decision and resulting orders and they should be should be reversed.
ADVERTISEMENT
Existing Apple Watches are not affected by the orders, nor are devices sold outside the United States.
Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S. from Thursday will still have an app icon for the blood oxygen features. But when users tap those icons, they will informed the features are unavailable.
APPLE’S OPTIONS
Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies, had expected Apple to disable the blood oxygen features on its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watch models in the U.S. rather than stop selling the wearable devices.
Apple does not break out Apple Watch or U.S. sales figures specifically, but about 42% of its overall revenue came from North America last year.
ADVERTISEMENT
While Apple Watch sales are far smaller than those of Apple’s flagship iPhone, the device anchors the company’s wearables sales segment, which accounted for $39.84 billion of Apple’s overall $383.29 billion in sales for fiscal 2023.
The ITC’s import ban on Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches briefly went into effect on Dec. 26. The Federal Circuit lifted the ban on Dec. 27 while it considered Apple’s request for a long-term pause, and Apple resumed sales of the smartwatches later that day.
Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in Apple Watches. The ITC barred imports and direct Apple sales of Apple Watches that read blood-oxygen levels following a Masimo complaint.
Apple stopped selling its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the U.S. before Christmas until the appeals court’s temporary pause. The devices remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon.com, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart.
ADVERTISEMENT
Apple asked the Washington-based Federal Circuit to keep the ban on hold for the duration of the appeals process, which is likely to take months. It argued that it was likely to win its appeal and that keeping the ban in effect would harm the company, its suppliers and the public.
The commission countered that Apple’s arguments “amount to little more” than a patent infringer “requesting permission to continue infringing.”
Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in smartwatches since its Series 6 Apple Watch in 2020. It has countersued Masimo for patent infringement, calling Masimo’s legal actions a “maneuver to clear a path” for its own competing watch.
An Apple company report said its wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-to-sell-some-watches-without-blood-oxygen-feature-after-us-court-ruling-9114945/,technology
"AI buzzes Davos, but CEOs wrestle with how to make it pay","OpenAI, which also bans abusive impersonation through its technology, on Monday said it is working with the National Association of Secretaries of State in the U.S. and will start directing users to CanIVote.org for election-related questions.","Bright banners tout the promise of artificial intelligence along the main promenade of Davos, but executives at the World Economic Forum (WEF) say they are grappling with how to turn early demos into money-makers.
The arrival of OpenAI’s viral ChatGPT triggered a frenzy of venture investment and an abrupt change of course inside the world’s biggest technology companies since late 2022.
This year, several CEOs at the WEF meeting in Davos told Reuters that the latest generative AI still has a lot to prove.
Cloud and internet security company Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told Reuters that the months ahead may even feel like an “AI letdown”.
“Everyone’s like, yeah, I can build these cool demos, but where’s the real value?” he said, echoing a theme among business leaders attending the WEF meeting.
ChatGPT’s rapid rise is in some ways an outlier.
In the first two months since its November 2022 launch, the chatbot reached an estimated 100 million users, making it one of the fastest growing applications in history.
ADVERTISEMENT
The program brought so-called generative AI to consumers’ fingertips, letting people write a short prompt and generate a poem, school essay or gather information as if with a search engine. It also proved a good collaborator for developing ideas in “low stakes, not business-critical use cases,” said Victor Riparbelli, CEO of AI video generation startup Synthesia.
But “the enterprise is definitely not really ready” for this chat-based AI, he said in an interview.
One problem Riparbelli cited is there is no clear path to end so-called “hallucinations,” or false content generated by AI. While computer scientists have developed methods for constraining places from which chatbots can draw responses, business leaders may not want the risk.
Other concerns, said IBM’s Europe, Middle East & Africa Chair Ana Paula Assis, are stopping chatbot AI from reproducing human biases, and regulation.

“Clients are still very worried about how they bring those solutions within the boundaries of regulations and compliance,” she said.
Premier Li Qiang of China said in Davos that AI has to serve the common good but must be appropriately governed, because it “poses risks to security and to our ethics.” And China’s President Xi Jinping wants the United Nations to play a central role in AI discussions, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday.
Meanwhile, some 90% of 1,400 C-suite executives said they were waiting for generative AI to take a step beyond recent hype or were doing only limited experimentation and pilots, survey results published by consultancy BCG showed.
Big tech companies including Microsoft, Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com have pressed ahead, courting thousands of businesses to give the latest AI a try.
ADVERTISEMENT
Some have marketed message-drafting, meeting-summarizing AI as a way to save employees time. Google, which has long used AI in its products, is experimenting with a chatbot-like collaborator it calls Bard.
And Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a company event in Davos Wednesday that AI is poised to grow productivity and potentially accelerate science itself.
Yet businesses’ revenue and profit from recent efforts remain unclear.
‘GET REAL ABOUT AI’
While one Davos sign exhorted passers-by, “Let’s get real about AI,” efforts to find a market for it have led developers to consider diverse places.

Cohere, a high-profile AI startup that is focused on enterprises, views helping salespeople as one revenue path.
“It’s going to be on the sales side and making sales teams more productive,” Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez told Reuters. The hope would be “helping them do more outreach, more follow-ups, and automating a lot of that process.”
By contrast, medicine is more complicated. While speeding up note-taking for doctors is a worthy task for AI, automating the medical profession is not, as this could risk lives, said Gomez.
“We should be focused on assisting humans, not replacing doctors and having a chatbot doctor,” Gomez said.

Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan said the drugmaker was working with Microsoft with the aim of more widely rolling out AI to give samples to staff who submit 20 to 30,000 regulatory responses a year. The “next opportunity,” he said at Microsoft’s event, would be AI for drug design.
Tejpreet Chopra, CEO of BLP Group, a major wind and solar operator in India, told Reuters he is ready to incorporate AI chat technology “but only for internal use for writing good English, not for content.”
Elections are a high-stakes area concerning AI companies, as voters around the world head to the polls in 2024.
Regarding the use of AI in misinformation campaigns, Gomez said Cohere’s policies prohibit impersonation, while Riparbelli said Synthesia does not allow customers to make political content through its AI video platform.
ADVERTISEMENT
OpenAI, which also bans abusive impersonation through its technology, on Monday said it is working with the National Association of Secretaries of State in the U.S. and will start directing users to CanIVote.org for election-related questions.
Understanding how content is created is a key concern among companies and policymakers, said Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
“If (people) see a video or an image, they should be able to know whether it is AI-generated or human generated,” Prabhakar told Reuters in an interview.
For Srini Pallia, an executive at technology services and consulting company Wipro, the AI buzz at Davos is loud and clear, filling the void left by crypto.

Meta’s Sheryl Sandberg to exit board after 12 years,"Once second-in-command to founder Zuckerberg, Sandberg was one of the most visible executives at the company and the lead architect of its often-criticized ads-based business model.","Meta Platforms’ former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg plans to step down from her position on the company’s board of directors after her term ends in May, she said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.

Study reveals how AI models can be turned into exploitative backdoors,"New study by Anthropic finds that AI assistants can be manipulated to perform malicious actions, making them highly vulnerable to hacking.","AI tools can enhance the web experience and the productivity of companies, but they can also pose serious threats to cybersecurity and user safety. A recent study revealed that large language models (LLMs), which are widely used for natural language processing tasks, can be secretly manipulated to perform malicious actions, such as injecting harmful code into software projects.
The study was conducted by Anthropic, the AI company that created the popular chatbot Claude, which is backed by tech giants like Amazon and Google. The researchers showed that LLMs can be turned into hidden backdoors, which can be activated by specific triggers to execute harmful behavior. For example, an LLM can be trained to write secure code if the year is 2023, but write vulnerable code if the year is 2024.

Scientists claim this soil-powered fuel cell can ‘run forever’,This fuel cell generates power with the help of microbes in the soil and can potentially be used in green infrastructure and precision agriculture applications.,"A team led by Northwestern University in Illinois have developed a new fuel cell they claim can harvest energy from microbes living in the soil.
The fuel is around the size of a book and can potentially be used to fuel underground sensors used in green infrastructure and precision agriculture. It could become a sustainable, renewable alternative to batteries that use toxic and flammable chemicals which could leak into the ground when used in the soil. Also, the materials used to manufacture batteries come through conflict-affected supply chains and contribute to electronic waste.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/soil-powered-fuel-cell-run-forever-9113100/,technology

Synopsys to buy engineering software firm Ansys in $35 billion deal,The transaction would be the biggest acquisition in the technology sector since chipmaker Broadcom took over software maker VMware last November in a $69 billion deal.,"Chip design software maker Synopsys said on Tuesday it would buy Ansys in a $35 billion cash-and-stock deal, snapping up the maker of software used in creating products from airplanes to tennis rackets of players like Novak Djokovic.
The transaction would be the biggest acquisition in the technology sector since chipmaker Broadcom took over software maker VMware last November in a $69 billion deal.
It could herald more big deals as a pickup in economic sentiment and some failed attempts by antitrust regulators to thwart deals embolden chief executives to place large acquisition bets.
The deal implies a per-share value of $390.19 and represents a premium of about 29% over Ansys’ last close on Dec. 21, 2023, the companies said.
The transaction will create a massive new player in a sector of the business software industry that is already highly consolidated, which Wells Fargo said in a note creates regulatory uncertainty. After the news, Synopsys shares were up 3.8% to $513, but Ansys shares were down 4.8% to $329.86.
The tie-up comes at time when leading companies like Nvidia and Intel are designing much more complex chips that are made of many pieces, as well as designing the massive computing systems that house the chips. Synopsys makes tools to design the chips themselves, a complement to offerings from Anysys, which makes software for evaluating larger electronic systems where those chips end up.
“Today, if you talk to a silicon company, their ability to continue on innovating … is limited by not having a solution that is integrated,” Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi told Reuters. “So the market is asking for that integrated solution.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Reuters was first to report on Dec. 22 that Synopsys was in talks to acquire Ansys. Ansys started exploring a sale late last year after getting inbound acquisition interest from design software firm Cadence Design Systems, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal comes just two weeks after Synopsys co-founder and Executive Chairman Aart de Geus handed over the chief executive reins to Ghazi.
The pursuit of such a transformative acquisition amid a leadership change underscores the commercial appeal of Ansys’ software.
Ansys makes simulation software used by engineers, designers and researchers across industries like aerospace, defense, automotive and energy to help analyze products. The company’s products compete with Autodesk’s Fusion 360, AutoCAD and Dassault Systemes’ Solidworks.
ADVERTISEMENT
For its part, Synopsys is a mainstay of chip design companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and Nvidia but also has benefited from a growing trend of firms like Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google taking some chip design efforts in-house.
The deal would bring together Synopsys’ semiconductor electronic design automation (EDA) tools with Ansys’ simulation and analysis portfolio. The EDA industry is already highly consolidated between Synopsys and Cadence, both of which have similar market capitalizations.
DEAL COULD TRIGGER REGULATORS’ SCRUTINY
Though Anysys is not a direct competitor to either company, the deal could trigger regulatory scrutiny, especially key markets such as China, where approval times have become more difficult to predict.
Ghazi and Ansys CEO Ajei Gopal told Reuters that the boards of both companies retained independent advisers to evaluate regulatory risks.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Based on many, many, many discussions, we believe that this deal should be done in the first half of ’25,” Ghazi said. However, “we gave ourselves 24 months with the priority and objective to get it done.”
Both Synopsys and Ansys have seen their share price jump significantly over the past 12 months, amid an artificial intelligence boom.
They began their partnership in 2017 to offer solutions to chip designers for analyzing chips for quality standards to make the overall designing process efficient.
The transaction is expected to add to Synopsys’ adjusted earnings within the second full year post-closing and be “substantially” accretive thereafter.
ADVERTISEMENT
If the deal is called off under specific circumstances, including antitrust hurdles, Synopsys will have to pay Ansys a termination fee of $1.5 billion.
If Ansys ends the deal to accept another, superior proposal, it will be required to pay the design software firm $950 million.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/synopsys-to-buy-engineering-software-firm-ansys-in-35-billion-deal-9112777/,technology
Microsoft CEO ‘comfortable’ with OpenAI non-profit despite Altman ouster,"Competition authorities in Europe, Britain and reportedly the United States have started looking closely at the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Tuesday said he had no issue with partner OpenAI’s governance structure, two months after the startup’s non-profit board temporarily ousted its chief executive without regard to investors’ interests.
The surprise November dismissal of OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman over an alleged communication breakdown triggered a crisis at the startup behind ChatGPT, in which employees threatened to resign en masse and go work for Microsoft, which is backing OpenAI with billions of dollars.
“I’m comfortable. I have no issues with any structure,” Nadella said at a Bloomberg News event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos.
OpenAI’s board, charged with protecting the startup non-profit’s mission to develop powerful artificial intelligence that benefits humanity, ultimately restored Altman days later and now is in the process of filling out its membership.

“I expect us to make a lot of progress on that in the coming months,” OpenAI CEO Altman said at a later Bloomberg event in Davos. “And then after that, the new board will take a look at the governance structure.”
“We’ll go look at it from all angles,” he said.
Microsoft has now secured a non-voting observer position on the OpenAI board.

Competition authorities in Europe, Britain and reportedly the United States have started looking closely at the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship. Their agreement guarantees the Windows maker large chunks of the startup’s profits depending on certain conditions, a person briefed on the terms has said.
According to Nadella, the fact that Microsoft does not fully own OpenAI distinguished their deal in a pro-competitive way.
“Partnerships is one avenue of, in fact, having competition,” he said.
Microsoft’s investments in computing power and years-old bet on OpenAI before its ChatGPT fame, Nadella said, were a “highly risky bet” and “not all conventional wisdom”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/microsoft-ceo-comfortable-with-openai-non-profit-despite-altman-ouster-9112768/,technology

"These microbial heroes are saving corals from climate change, finds study",Scientists have discovered that the presence of a certain single-celled microbe could be key to the survival of some corals.,"Not all heroes wear capes, especially the ones that are single-celled microbes. Researchers discovered for the first time that the presence of certain microbes can tell them whether the coral will survive heat stress, often brought about by climate change.
“This is the first time that a non-algae microbe has been shown to influence the ability of corals to survive a heat-stress event. As corals face more and more heat-stress events due to climate change, a better understanding of all the microbes that may influence survivability can inform conservation practitioners as to which corals they should prioritize for intervention, said the study’s senior author Javier del Campo, in a press statement. Del Campo is an adjunct professor at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology IBE: CSIC-UPF in Barcelona, which led the study.

Apple dethrones Samsung to become global lead in smartphone shipments,"For the first time ever, Apple has overtaken Samsung as the top global smartphone vendor according to new data from IDC and Canalys.","The smartphone industry has undergone a major shift in 2023, with Apple taking the number one global spot for the first time ever, according to new data from IDC and Canalys released Monday and Tuesday. After over a decade of Samsung dominance, Apple managed to edge out its rival and become the top smartphone vendor globally in terms of shipments – and it was actually pretty close.
According to IDC, Apple shipped an estimated 234.6 million smartphones in 2023, just ahead of Samsung’s 226.6 million. This marks a reversal from previous years, when Samsung comfortably led the market. IDC attributes Apple’s rise to a combination of factors, including strong demand for the latest iPhones and increased regulatory challenges for Samsung in China. According to Nabila Popal, research director at IDC, “While we saw some strong growth from low-end Android players like Transsion and Xiaomi in the second half of 2023, the biggest winner is clearly Apple.”

"Redesigned Apple Watches not subject to import ban, US Customs says",Apple had said that a proposed redesign would allow it to circumvent findings that the watches infringe Masimo's blood-oxygen reading pulse oximetry patents.,"A U.S. law enforcement agency has determined that Apple can use a redesign to bypass an import ban on newer Apple Watch models stemming from its patent infringement dispute with Masimo, the medical-monitoring technology company said in a court filing on Monday.
The import ban, issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), applies to Apple’s current Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches and initially went into effect on Dec. 26. Apple convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to pause the ban the next day, and has since resumed selling the watches as it contests the import ruling.

Apple offers iPhone 15 at rare discount in China as competition intensifies,Online shopping platforms including Pinduoduo have been slashing prices of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro by as much as 16% since the beginning of the year.,"Apple is offering rare discounts on its iPhones in China, cutting retail prices by as much as 500 yuan ($70) amid growing competitive pressure in the world’s biggest smartphone market.
The U.S. tech giant cut prices of some iPhones by 5%, its Chinese website showed on Monday. The time-limited promotion, branded as a Lunar New Year event, will last from Jan. 18 through Jan. 21 in a lead-up to the holiday in mid-February.
Sales of Apple’s latest iPhone 15 series of handsets have been far worse than previous models in China.
Home-grown rivals such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi offer competitive models, while sources have said some companies and government departments have been limiting staffers’ use of Apple devices – mirroring U.S. government restrictions of Chinese apps on security grounds.

Chinese iPhone sales dropped 30% in the first week of 2024 versus the same period a year earlier, Jefferies analysts said in a client note, having fallen 3% for all of 2023. Analysts expect the competitive landscape to get tougher this year.
Apple has not cut prices for its latest iPhones in years. The cuts come after it surprised the market by not raising prices for the iPhone 15 series at its September launch.
Online shopping platforms including Pinduoduo have been slashing prices of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro by as much as 16% since the beginning of the year.

Nicole Peng, senior vice president of market research firm Canalys, said the discounts did not come as a surprise as Apple is under pressure to boost sales globally, and especially in China, amid intensifying competition and Apple fans’ growing reluctance to upgrade.
“It is clear that Huawei is making a comeback,” Peng said, “Some Chinese consumers may return to using Huawei as driven by patriotism.”
Canalys expects Apple sales this year to stay flat worldwide while suffering a slight decline in China.

"AI could displace up to 40% of jobs, with advanced economies most exposed: IMF","IMF says that AI could affect 40% of global jobs, hitting advanced economies hardest. But with the right policies, countries can manage AI's impact.","Artificial intelligence is set to transform the workplace, with up to 40% of jobs potentially affected globally according to a new analysis by the International Monetary Fund. However, surprisingly, the impact will not be felt equally across countries. Advanced economies like the US and Europe face greater disruption than emerging markets and low-income nations.
“In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in a recent blog post about the study. She warned that if AI complements high-income workers more, it could widen wealth gaps as returns to capital increase.

"This Rs 7,299 phone looks like it was designed in California",Itel A70 review: This budget phone tries really hard to imitate the iPhone. See if it pulls it off.,"When it comes to smartphone design, Apple’s iPhones have become the golden standard that many other brands attempt to emulate. Some take subtle cues, adopting a feature here or design element there to enhance their own devices. Others opt for a more obvious “borrowing” of style that toes the line of a full-on steal. But imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? Today we’re reviewing the all-new itel A70 so that you can decide where it falls on the imitation spectrum and whether it’s worth the money.
Straight out of Cupertino?
Right off the bat, you realise the itel A70 is trying so hard to replicate the latest iPhones – specifically the iPhone 15 Pro Max – that you want to let it have its moment. There’s a triple camera setup on the back – or at least it’s made to look that way. The actual lens count is two, with the main 13MP sensor and a 0.08MP auxiliary lens. The “third camera” is just a flash to complete the illusion.

According to the post, a version of the Pixel launcher, included in the Android 14 QPR2 Beta 3 includes a hidden option called “Search Engine,” indicating, that Google might soon allow users to change the search engine on the home page of a Pixel smartphone.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-pixel-alternative-search-engine-9109791/,technology
Apple will give Vision Pro buyers a 25-minute tutorial in stores,Vision Pro demo at retail stores to include customising the hardware for individual users.,"Apple retail stores are the best places to experience various Apple devices, and the company will now be using the same space to offer an extensive Vision Pro experience, suggests a report from Bloomberg. According to Mark Gurman’s latest Power On Newsletter, each Vision Pro demo session will include hardware personalisation and will last up to 25 minutes.
As per the report, Apple employees will first customise the headset by choosing the right light seal by scanning the face, a process, that is said to be similar to registering Face ID on your iPhone. Next, the company will use a special apparatus and fit the headset with the right prescription glasses, where, an Apple employee will manually fit the right lenses to the Vision Pro.
This Apple Store has put a new cabinet on its showroom floor related to the Vision Pro quite a bit early. This is for storing items related to the demos. https://t.co/MPsLc1TIca pic.twitter.com/M6DIdeSgE3
— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) January 15, 2024
Post the initial prep, Apple will guide customers on how to handle the headset, including how to hold it properly. The demo session is expected to focus on the ability to watch 3D content (Spatial photos and videos), which can be shot on the iPhone 15 Pro series. The session will also include a demo of how Vision Pro can be used as a Mac or an iPad replacement.

Apple is also expected to have designed a second pair of straps, which is more comfortable than the first one and partners like Belkin are also said to launch accessories like battery clip, which lives outside the headset. While this is said to be the experience that one will receive when buying the headset at retail stores, users can also purchase the device directly from the online store, which will not involve any of this. In that case, users might have to scan their face using an iPhone (Face ID) to get the right light seal and one has to even enter the glass prescription (if any) manually.
According to a recent report by Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has readied over 80,000 units of the Vision Pro at launch, which will be available across the US. Consequently, the company is also said to be working on a more affordable variant of the Vision Pro and will slowly transition to an AR glass that might look like a regular sunglass, similar to the recently announced XReal Air 2 Ultra AR at CES 2024.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-vision-pro-25-minutes-demo-9109687/,technology
Best Samsung smartphones to consider ahead of Unpacked 2024,"The Galaxy S23 Ultra, despite being almost an year old smartphone is still one of the best Android smartphones in the market.","Samsung Unpacked 2024 is just around the corner, where, the South Korean tech brand will showcase the latest smartphone innovations. At the same time, a lot of flagship Galaxy S series smartphones have gotten a lot more affordable than ever before.
Here are some of the best Galaxy S series smartphones that are worth considering ahead of the Galaxy S24 series launch.
Samsung Galaxy S23 FE
Samsung’s Galaxy S23 FE was launched just a few months back, and the smartphone is already available at a discounted price of Rs 44,999 (including bank discounts). While it looks just like the Galaxy S23, the FE is powered by the in-house Exynos 2200 SoC, and it has a flagship-grade triple camera setup with a dedicated telephoto and an ultra-wide angle lens. The device has a premium metal frame with a glass back, and it is IP68-rated for water and dust resistance.
Just like the other Samsung smartphones, the Galaxy S23 FE will also receive four major Android OS upgrades and five years of security updates. On top of that, with a 6.4-inch display, it is also one of the most compact high-performance Android smartphones.
Samsung Galaxy S23
For Rs 54,999, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is practical and a compact Android flagship smartphone that’s worth considering. The device is based on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC for Galaxy, and it has everything that one expects from a flagship, which includes eSIM support, IP68 rating, and wireless/reverse wireless charging capability.
On top of that, the device has a great 6.1-inch screen, and if there is any phone that matches the form factor of a standard iPhone, it is the Galaxy S23. There are also some beautiful colour options available, and the Galaxy S23 with its slightly curved frame, glass back, and a 120Hz display at the front, makes it a simple yet elegant-looking Android smartphone.
Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
The flagship Galaxy S23 Ultra is now available for around Rs 97,000 on Amazon with over Rs 25,000 discount from its launch price. This is currently the flagship offering from Samsung, and it is also one of the few smartphones that offer an integrated stylus called S-Pen, a dual telephoto lens with support for up to 100x zoom, and the smartphone also has a large 2K resolution curved display with 120Hz refresh rate.

Despite the Galaxy S24 Ultra launch just a few days away, the Galaxy S23 Ultra is still a compelling smartphone, especially for those, who want a really balanced smartphone that offers everything and a bit more that a power user expects from an Android smartphone.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/best-samsung-smartphones-to-consider-ahead-of-unpacked-2024-9109019/,technology
"Oppo Reno 11 Pro review: Style over substance, yet a decent mid-ranger",Oppo Reno 11 Pro is a well-rounded device with a pro-grade and versatile camera setup.,"Oppo has made a name for itself with its Reno series, thanks to the focus on cameras and design. While they may not be considered premium, Oppo Reno devices can easily be categorized as upper mid-range. Oppo recently unveiled the Reno 11 Pro, and I had the opportunity to get hands-on experience with the device. From first impressions to the aspects that impressed me, here is my review of the latest Oppo Reno 11 Pro.
Design
For review, I got the Pearl White variant in 12GB and 256GB storage. The first thing that caught my attention after unboxing the device was the stylishly tapered design, and the shimming curved glass back. With its 7.6mm thickness, the device felt sleek and offered a comfortable lightweight grip. I must note that I am not a fan of large-screen smartphones. The smallest I can comfortably manage is a 6.1-inch device, which, to me, feels portable and handy. However, the 6.7-inch dynamic AMOLED display turned out to be stunning and I was in for more surprises as the days passed.
Display
With smartphones doubling as portable theatres, I have a preference for vibrant displays that bring out gritty blacks, accentuating the drama. I found the 6.7-inch AMOLED to be a gorgeous centrepiece that not only provides an expansive viewing but also a bezel-less feel. The screen refresh rate effortlessly switches between 60Hz and 120Hz allowing fluid scrolling and transitions across apps. An avid Twitter user, I found the adaptive refresh rate greatly useful.
The display also supports over 1 billion colours and has up to 950 nits of peak brightness. This is useful for those who work outdoors most of the time. OTT streaming comes to life with the HDR10+ support which allows the colours to pop. Be it gaming, watching movies, or simply going about your daily activities, the Reno 11 Pro display is immersive. I particularly enjoyed reading about the display that offered a strain-free experience even during nighttime.
Camera
The camera module is clearly the biggest USP of this OPPO device. In my experience, the pro-grade cameras are highly versatile and are capable of producing images that are equal to those shot on professional DSLRs. When it comes to photography, I consider myself amature and mostly rely on the appendages of smartphone cameras to flaunt my creativity. The 50MP Sony IMX 890 camera aptly handles landscapes and portraits and this it does even in low light conditions.
On the other hand, the dedicated 32MP Sony IMX 709 telephoto lens adds a professional touch to portrait photography. One can further enhance their portraits with features like Portrait Expert Engine and bring out some artistic images. I also found the 4K selfie camera, which is a 32 MP Sony IMX709, to be a handy vlogging apparatus saving you the pains of carrying additional equipment. Of course, it’s not professional photography, yet the 4K videos at 30fps appear crisp.

Performance
While the Oppo Reno boasts a catchy exterior and a stunning display, the question is, is it equally a good performer? The device is powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 8200 chipset and 12GB RAM. In my two weeks, worth of usage, I saw the device glide through intensive loads without any stutter. The phone is capable of multitasking quite efficiently. The device proves to be a delight for gamers as Oppo’s enhancements and the large 4600mAh battery keep you powered up through intense gaming sessions.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the software front, we get Oppo’s latest ColorOS 14 interface on top of Android 14. Some of the nifty tools like File Dock, Smart Touch, and Smart Image Matting are great additions. I also feel it is one of the best customisations ever found on Android devices in this range. When it comes to charging, the Reno 11 Pro ships with an 80W SUPERVOOC charger, and it claims to fully charge in just 28 minutes. I have had many charging sessions, and true to the claim the device fully charges in well under 30 minutes.
Geekbench 6 GPU results for the device showed a single-core score of 1131, which indicates moderate performance for basic graphics tasks. The multi-core score of 3498 suggests better potential for graphics-intensive applications. On the other hand, the AnTuTu score of 912339 falls within the mid-range, implying decent performance for daily tasks and gaming. (Benchmark scores should be considered along with user reviews and real-world testing for a comprehensive understanding.) In short, the Oppo Reno Pro is capable of multitasking through your daily activities like a breeze. Playing BGMI or Asphalt 9 offers a lag-free enjoyable experience.
Should you buy the Oppo Reno 11 Pro?
After spending two weeks with the device, I conclude that the Oppo Reno11 Pro 5G, priced at Rs 39,999, stands as an excellent choice for those seeking a well-rounded device. My only issue has been the Mediatek 8200 chipset which was launched in 2022. At a time when Poco X6 Pro ships with the superior Dimensity 8300 Ultra which offers a performance at par with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, the Reno 11 Pro which is far higher priced dampens in essence. In a similar price range, one could consider the OnePlus 11R, which comes with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 mobile.
However, what I liked about the device includes its gorgeous display, versatile camera system, and smooth all-around performance. The Reno11 Pro excels as both a productivity and a creative multitasking tool. For style, photography enthusiasts, and general power users alike, the Reno 11 Pro comes as a decent choice.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/oppo-reno-11-pro-review-9109031/,technology

Fake Ayodhya Ram Mandir pran pratishtha invites target religious zeal on WhatsApp,Received an invite for a VIP pass for the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha ceremony on WhatsApp? It might be a scam.,"As the preparations for the Ayodhya Ram Temple’s pran pratishtha (establishment of the image in its vital breath or bringing life to the temple) are in full swing, scammers are misusing this opportunity and are exploiting people of their hard-earned money by luring them with fake VIP invites for the event.
According to a report by News18, several users have started receiving an APK (android application package) named ‘Ram Janmabhoomi Grihsampark Abhiyan.APK’ and prompting users to install the same on their Android smartphones to get VIP access to the Ram Mandir pran pratishtha event and is even promoting people to forward the same to others.
Right now, the report does not highlight what this APK actually does. However, it is likely to contain some form of spyware, which, when installed could steal user data by hacking into the smartphone. From accessing the real-time location to conducting financial frauds, this single app could take over the smartphone and also steal personal information like contacts, private photos, and videos.
Do note that neither the government (state or central) nor the Ram Madir trust has launched any kind of app for the VIP invites, and even if they release such an app. Hence, this is a bogus application that could lead to financial losses and data theft.
This is a major issue on Android smartphones, and iPhone users aren’t affected by this scam as Apple does not allow users to sideload apps on iPhones.
Several websites claim to deliver Ram Mandir Prasad for free where users only have to pay the shipping charge. Right now, there is no confirmation if such websites are legitimate or how they offer these services for free, and it is always advised to stay away from such platforms, as they will get access to your phone number, email, and address.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/fake-ram-mandir-pran-pratishtha-invites-target-religious-zeal-on-whatsapp-9108877/,technology
Instagram co-founders’ AI-powered news app Artifact shutting down after just 1 year,"A year after launch, Artifact is winding down. The AI news app from Instagram's founders struggled to define its identity and moderate content.","Artifact, the AI-driven news aggregation app created by Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, is closing down just one year after its launch in January 2023.
In a blog post announcing the shutdown, Systrom explained that while Artifact had developed a loyal user base who loved the app, the overall market opportunity was not large enough to justify continued investment.
“We have built something that a core group of users love, but we have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment in this way,” Systrom wrote.
Since launching last year, Artifact added several new features including AI-powered article summaries, the ability to comment on and mark articles as clickbait, and a Twitter-like posting feature. However, these latter features required extensive moderation that Artifact’s small 8-person team could not sufficiently support.
To aid the transition, Artifact will begin winding down features over the next few weeks, starting with disabling the ability to make new posts and comments. Existing posts will remain visible temporarily as the team works to reduce moderation needs. The app’s core news aggregation capability will continue operating through the end of February to give users time to find alternative services.
Systrom remained upbeat about the future despite Artifact’s shutdown, saying he was personally excited to explore new ideas in the AI space which seems full of possibilities. The increased competition in the market for Twitter-like conversation platforms and slowing growth of news aggregators likely contributed to Artifact’s struggles to find a clear product-market fit.
While Artifact tried to differentiate itself through AI-powered features like rewritten article summaries, its identity never fully coalesced into a coherent offering. It hadn’t clearly defined itself as a conversation platform, link sharing service, or AI-enhanced news engine. This diffuse focus coupled with the demands of content moderation made it challenging to scale.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/artifact-ai-news-app-shutting-down-9108918/,technology
"After 30 years, Microsoft is finally removing WordPad from Windows",Say goodbye to WordPad - Microsoft is phasing out the classic text editor for good.,"After over 30 years as a staple Windows application, Microsoft has announced that WordPad will be removed from future builds of Windows 11. The text editing program, which first debuted in Windows 95, will not be automatically installed on Windows 11 and eventually phased out completely.
This news came as part of the recent Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26020 for the Canary Channel. Microsoft stated that WordPad will not be available for reinstallation after it is removed. So this is very likely the end of the road for the classic app.
WordPad has long been positioned by Microsoft as a middle ground between full-featured Word and barebones Notepad. It offered basic formatting options like fonts, colors and paragraph alignment that made it popular for small documents and notes. But over the years, it seems WordPad became squeezed as Microsoft promoted Word for more robust documents and Notepad for plain text.
The company hinted at this in its documentation, recommending Word for rich text formats and Notepad for plain text. With capable alternatives available, Microsoft likely saw little value in continuing to develop WordPad. The writing may have already been on the wall, as Microsoft never updated WordPad with a dark mode for Windows 11. Meanwhile, Notepad received a dark mode and is slated to get new autosave capabilities.
So while it’s the end of the line for WordPad, its predecessor Notepad seems poised to continue as a Windows fixture. For many, WordPad was their first experience with word processing before graduating to Word. But with its demise, Microsoft is clearly streamlining its apps for the way people create documents today. For quick notes, there’s Notepad. And for anything more advanced, the ubiquitous Office suite has it covered. After 30 years of changes in technology, WordPad simply became the odd app out.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/wordpad-deprecation-soon-9108850/,technology
YouTube’s war against ad-blockers continues as it expands site slowdowns,Pay up or suffer lag: YouTube is expanding slowdowns on the site for users with ad blockers.,"YouTube last year started artificially slowing down its site for users with ad blockers enabled. Now, according to reports from affected viewers, this tactic is being expanded to more users.
Ads are a massive revenue source for YouTube, so it’s no surprise they want to discourage ad blocking. But their methods are raising controversy among users who feel trapped between intrusive ads or paying a monthly fee.
The first phase of YouTube’s anti-ad blocking efforts involved popup messages stating “ad blockers violate YouTube’s Terms of Service.” Users had to disable their ad blocker to proceed.
Now YouTube has moved into directly sabotaging the user experience by throttling site performance. A 9to5Google report has highlighted how Redditors have complained about YouTube suffering from lag, buffering issues and other glitches when an ad blocker is enabled.
Youtube started slowing video buffer with adblock enabled

https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js
YouTube seems to be imposing an artificial timeout or bandwidth limit to mimic a slow internet connection. Videos struggle to load, previews won’t generate, and fullscreen mode is unusable without a refresh.
This effectively makes YouTube unusable for ad blocker users, who now face a choice: disable their ad blocker and sit through video ads, or pay the Premium subscription fee for an ad-free experience.
YouTube believes ad blocking violates its terms of service since their business model depends on ads. Critics counter that excessive ads violate the user experience. This clash will likely intensify as YouTube doubles down on ads while users push back.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/youtube-expands-site-slowdown-ad-blocker-9108800/,technology
"Watch this space: NASA’s slow Artemis, Hubble’s fast radio burst, and Peregrine’s quick failure","This week's Watch this Space explores mysterious “fast radio burst” by ageing telescope, Astrobiotic’s Peregrine launch, and more.","We have been on a hiatus with Watch this Space, but the human spirit of exploration has not. This week, NASA’s Hubble team announced how the ageing telescope was able to spot the weird origin of a mysterious “fast radio burst,” while Pittsburgh-based space tech firm Astrobiotic’s private moon lander faced a malfunction shortly after launch.
Fast radio bursts or FRBs are exactly what they sound like. They last for a few milliseconds but they can outshine entire galaxies. In the past few years, we have detected hundreds of FRBs. NASA likens them to camera flashes at a stadium event but often, we do not know the sources of these intense bursts of radiation.
Also read | NASA delays Artemis mission; astronauts will not return to Moon till 2026
FRB 20220610A was detected on June 10, 2022, and is particularly weird even for FRBs. It seems to have flashed from an unlikely place — a collection of galaxies that existed when the universe was only five billion years old. This makes it the farthest and most powerful of its kind ever detected. A majority of the previous FRBs have been found in isolated galaxies.
The images from the Hubble telescope reveal that this FRB could have come from an environment where as many as seven galaxies may be on a possible path to merging. Astronomers do not all agree on what exactly causes FRBs, but it is generally believed that FRBs involve some sort of compact object like a neutron star.
Magnetars are an extreme type of neutron star with extremely strong magnetic fields. To illustrate, if there were a magnetar located halfway between the Moon and the Earth, it would erase the magnetic strip on everyone’s credit card in the world. If an astronaut were to travel within a few hundred kilometres of a magnetar, they would be “dissolved” because every atom in their body would be disrupted.
Before we can explore magnetars and other potential causes behind fast radio bursts, we must be fully capable of exploring our cosmic background within the solar system. While space exploration in the past has been dominated by the leadership of government space agencies, its future will see many private companies embarking on commercial space ventures.
Astrobiotic’s Peregrine launched from Cape Canaveral on Monday, hoping to be the first privately-led mission to launch on the Moon, following in the footsteps of the Israeli Beresheet and the Japanese Hakuto missions. But Peregrine may have followed their footsteps too well as the mission too will fail to soft-land on the Moon due to a propellant leak that sprung shortly after the United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur rocket’s upper stage deployed Peregrine.

“Sending a spacecraft to the Moon is not easy. I commend Astrobiotic’s hard work, resilience, and commitment as they navigate the challenges facing their mission. With any breakthrough innovation comes rewards and risks. Each lunar endeavour expands the opportunities for us to learn more and push the boundaries of what’s possible,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a post on X.com, referring to the company’s attempt.
Also read | In 2023, Indian science went for the Moon and reached for the Sun. What’s planned for 2024?
What Fox said closely mirrors what Laurie Leshin, director of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said after Japan’s Hakuto failed at the same task — “If space is hard, landing is harder.”
There are currently only four entities in human history that have succeeded in independently soft-landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and all four are countries — the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and India. To date, no mission led by a private entity has ever been able to soft land on the Moon. Forget the failures of Hakuto and Beresheet, even national space agencies did not fare all that well in the recent past.
Chandrayaan-2, India’s previous attempt at a lunar soft-landing, crash landed on the Moon a little before when it was supposed to touch down gracefully in 2019. Russia’s Luna-25 was the country’s first independent lunar mission in nearly half a century and it crash-landed on the Moon in an attempt to land near its south pole before India’s Chandrayaan-3.

Speaking about mishaps in space, Elon Musk-led SpaceX says it is ready to attempt another test launch for its Starship launch vehicle in February this year. Starship will be the biggest and most powerful rocket in history once it is complete, and it exploded during both of its previous test launches that happened last year.
But SpaceX does not see that as much of a setback with its fail-fast and iterate-faster approach. The most successful space technology firm in the world is able to function the way it does because it can afford to be more reckless and experimental with its missions, which allows it to quickly reiterate and improve its designs.
NASA will definitely not be complaining about SpaceX’s speed as many of the American space agency’s future Artemis missions to the Moon will hinge on Starship’s ability to get crucial supplies to a lunar orbit. In fact, NASA announced this week that its Artemis programme will be delayed once again, with astronauts’ return to the Moon delayed at least till 2026.
But between the massive resources of space agencies like NASA and the speed and innovation of firms like SpaceX, 2024 still promises to be a big year for space exploration.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/watch-this-space-nasa-artemis-hubble-radio-peregrine-9108765/,technology
Airtel and Jio to withdraw unlimited 5G plans in the second half of 2024,Get ready to pay more for 5G plans from Jio and Airtel.,"Airtel and Jio currently offer unlimited 5G data on select recharge plans. According to the latest report from the Economic Times, both telcos might discontinue unlimited 5G plans in the second half of 2024 and are also reported to hike the tariff by at least five to ten per cent.
According to analysts, both companies are now looking into increasing monetisation and revenue growth by hiking the tariff. Airtel and Jio are currently reported to be considering enhancing RoCE (return on capital employed) by at least 20 per cent to recover the higher cost of higher customer acquisition and 5G investments.

Right now, there are no standalone 5G plans offered by either of the companies, which will soon change. These plans are expected to be on the expensive side when compared to the 4G counterparts, and these plans are also expected to offer a higher data cap with over 30 to 40 per cent more data.
Airtel currently has a monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 200 and the company is said to be considering increasing it to Rs 250. There has also been steady growth in the 5G userbase with over 125 million 5G in the country, and both telcos are expected to grow the 5G userbase to around 200 million.

CES 2024: PC makers bet on AI to rekindle sales,"PC and chipmakers including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel are betting that the so-called ""neural processing units"" (NPUs) now found in the latest chip designs will encourage consumers to once again pay for higher-end laptops. Adding additional AI capabilities could help take market share from Apple.","PC and microchip companies struggling to get consumers to replace pandemic-era laptops offered a new feature to crowds this week at CES: artificial intelligence (AI).
PC and chipmakers including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel are betting that the so-called “neural processing units” (NPUs) now found in the latest chip designs will encourage consumers to once again pay for higher-end laptops. Adding additional AI capabilities could help take market share from Apple.
“The conversations I’m having with customers are about ‘how do I get my PC ready for what I think is coming in AI and going to be able to deliver,'” said Sam Burd, Dell Technologies’ president of its PC business.
Chipmakers built the NPU blocks because they can achieve a high level of performance for AI functions with relatively modest power needs. Today there are few applications that might take full advantage of the new capabilities, but more are coming, said David McAfee, corporate vice president and general manager of the client channel business at AMD.
Among the few applications that can take advantage of such chips is the creative suite of software produced by Adobe.
Intel hosted an “open house” where a handful of PC vendors showed off their latest laptops with demos designed to put the new capabilities on display. Machines from the likes of Dell and Lenovo were arrayed inside one of the cavernous ballrooms at the Venetian Convention Center on Las Vegas Boulevard.
A Dell laptop at the open house included an AI key, the first button Microsoft has added to a Windows keyboard in decades. The “Copilot” key activates Microsoft’s generative AI software that can help with applications and answer complicated questions.

At the moment, the new button summons a cloud-based Copilot, which takes a noticeable amount of time to perform tasks.”If I put those engines on the PC, I can be faster, lower latency, and I can do more with those engines,” Burd said.
To move Copilot onto the PC will require considerably more powerful machines than currently exist – even with the advanced AI chips. For the moment, the new chips are included with more expensive laptops on offer by the PC builders that work with Intel and AMD.
“In the short term we’ll be focused more on premium PCs,” said McAfee, adding that PCs with advanced AI chips will likely cost between $800 to $1,200.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/laptops/ces-pc-makers-bet-on-ai-9108577/,technology

"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, US House Speaker Mike Johnson discuss AI’s risk","The CEO told reporters they discussed ""trying to balance this sort of tremendous upside and figure out how to mitigate the risk"" of AI.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met Republican US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Capitol Hill on Thursday and the two discussed the risks of artificial intelligence, the lawmaker’s office and the ChatGPT maker’s boss said.
Why it is important
The administration of Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden has been pressing lawmakers for AI regulation, but a polarized US Congress, where Republicans control the House and Democrats have a Senate majority, has made little headway in passing effective regulation.
The rise of AI has fed a host of concerns, including the fear that it could be used to disrupt the democratic process, turbocharge fraud or lead to job loss, among other harms. Europe is ahead of the US on regulations around AI, with lawmakers there drafting AI rules.
Key quotes
The two met on Thursday “to discuss the promise and risks of AI and other technologies. The Speaker believes that Congress should encourage innovation, help maintain our competitive edge, and stay mindful of potential risks,” Johnson’s office said in a statement.
Altman told reporters they discussed “trying to balance this sort of tremendous upside and figure out how to mitigate the risk” of AI, adding he was “excited to see what the legislative process will do.”

Context
Microsoft-backed OpenAI was founded as an open-source nonprofit, before co-founder Altman pivoted to a capped-profit structure in 2019.
In November, Altman said Microsoft would take a non-voting, observer position on the company’s board.
OpenAI ousted Altman on Nov. 17 without any detailed cause, setting off alarm bells among investors and employees. He was reinstated days later with the promise of a new board.

In a memo sent to employees Thursday, Audible CEO Bob Carrigan said the company is in good shape, but faces an “increasingly challenging landscape.”
“We did not take this route without considerable thought,” Carrigan said. “But getting leaner and more efficient is the way we will need to operate now — and in the foreseeable future — in order to continue delivering best-in-class audio storytelling to our customers around the world.”
A spokesperson for Audible declined to provide the number of employees who will be affected by the cuts.

Microsoft overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company,Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company on Thursday after the iPhone maker began 2024 with its worst start in years due to growing demand concerns.,"Microsoft overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company on Thursday after the iPhone maker’s shares made a weak start to 2024 due to growing concerns over demand.
Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft were last up 1.6%, giving it a market valuation of $2.875 trillion as its early lead in the race to make money from generative artificial intelligence helped draw investors.
Apple was 0.9% lower with a market capitalization of $2.871 trillion – the first time since 2021 that its valuation has fallen below that of Microsoft.
The Cupertino, California-based company’s stock has slid 3.3% in January as of last close, compared with a 1.8% rise in Microsoft.
“It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.
The weakness in Apple stock follows a series of rating downgrades that fanned worries that sales of the iPhone, its biggest cash cow, would stay weak, especially in major market China.
“China could be a drag on performance over the coming years,” brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, pointing to competition from a resurgent Huawei and Sino-U.S. tensions that have increased pressure on Apple.
ADVERTISEMENT
The brokerage added Apple’s services business – a bright spot in recent quarters – faces threats as regulators deepen scrutiny of a lucrative deal that makes Google the default search engine on iOS.
Shares of Apple, whose market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, ended last year with a gain of 48%.
That was lower than the 57% rise posted by Microsoft, which aggressively rolled out genAI-powered tools in 2023 thanks to its tie-up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.
Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018, most recently in 2021 when concerns about COVID-driven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone maker’s stock price.
ADVERTISEMENT
Currently, Wall Street is more positive on Microsoft. The company has no “sell” rating and nearly 90% of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock.
Apple has two “sell” ratings and only two-thirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a “buy”.
Both the stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies.
Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/microsoft-apple-valuable-company-tech-9105669/,technology

I tried the Poco X6 Pro: Here’s what’s good (and bad),Poco X6 Pro is a balanced mid-tier smartphone that excels in performance.,"If there is one thing that Poco smartphones are known for, it’s their eye-catching designs and performance. This applies not only to their popular mid-range phones but also to entry-level devices. I like how Poco is trying to differentiate itself from the competition. Its latest model, the Poco X6 Pro, is no different, and it sets the tone for how the brand positions its smartphones against some of the most popular phones in the mid-end of the market. I have been using the Poco X6 Pro for over a week, and here is what I think about the smartphone.

Design: Undoubtedly Poco
As soon as I unboxed the X6 Pro, it was pretty evident that this is a mid-tier Poco smartphone with its Poco Yellow finish, featuring a faux leather back panel, which offers great in-hand feel, reminiscent of the Redmi Note 13 Pro+. The large rectangular camera island, industrial design, and the yellow-coloured power button clearly give this phone a unique look.

Rabbit R1 vs Humane’s AI Pin: Who will be the ultimate smartphone killer?,"Startups Rabbit and Humane think they can solve smartphone addiction and complexity. Who's doing it better, though?","When Apple dropped the first iPhone on the tech scene in 2007, it rewrote the smartphone rulebook. Fast forward nearly a decade, and smartphones have morphed into these devices we spend hours on, rather than tools that save us precious time. A couple of tech startups are stepping up now to refocus on the practical side of smartphones, so you can finally give your neck a break from staring down.
Following Humane’s AI Pin debut last November, a new player has entered the scene with an innovative approach to replacing pocketable rectangular slabs with, well, another smaller rectangular slab. “Our mission is to create the simplest computer, something so intuitive that you don’t need to learn how to use it,” said Jesse Lyu, Rabbit’s founder, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. And judging by the keynote, the idea does seem pretty promising.

The study presented at the Computational Humanities Research Conference on Saturday showed that ChatGPT, a large language model based chatbot developed by OpenAI, was “memorising poems,” especially the famous ones that are commonly found online. This poses ethical questions about how ChatGPT and other AI models are trained using data scraped from the internet.

Logitech Wave Keys review: A wave of typing comfort,"With the perfect amount of key travel and soft cushion, the Wave Keys can be a great keyboard for both home or office use.","It is common for people who work long hours on computers to suffer from discomfort, stiffness and pain across their arms and wrists.

The Logitech Wave Keys falls in the latter category by offering an ergonomically designed keyboard for those who spend long hours typing.
As the name suggests, the Logitech Wave Keys is designed like a wave. This means the keyboard actually looks like a wave and not the rectangular tablet we are used to. While the keys are spread out with a flowing wave pattern, going up and down slightly in height as you move from ASDF to LKJH, you realise this array fits perfectly from where your wrists are rested.

Microsoft challenges Apple as world’s most valuable company,"A handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.","A recent dip in Apple’s stock over worries about iPhone sales has left the Silicon Valley tech heavyweight in danger of being overtaken by Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company.
Fresh worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple’s shares down 4% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 2% year to date after surging 57% in 2023.
Apple dipped 0.4% on Wednesday, while Microsoft added 1.6%, further eroding the iPhone maker’s lead. Apple’s stock market value is now at $2.866 trillion, compared to Microsoft’s $2.837 trillion value.
Apple’s market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, while Microsoft’s value reached as much as $2.844 trillion on Nov. 28.

iPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024, Jefferies analysts said in a client note this week, adding to signs of growing competitive pressures from Huawei and other domestic rivals.
Sales of Apple’s Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple’s biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report on Monday estimated that Vision Pro sales would be “relatively immaterial” to Apple’s earnings per share in 2024.

OpenAI launches GPT Store to capitalize on ChatGPT’s consumer success,"The GPT Store will initially be rolled out to users who are on paid ChatGPT plans, OpenAI said. In the next several months, the company intends to add a way for GPT creators to monetize their personalized AIs.","Artificial intelligence lab OpenAI has launched its GPT Store, a marketplace for personalized artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday.
The GPT Store is located within the popular ChatGPT chatbot, and is a place for users to discover and build GPTs, or AI customized for tasks like teaching math or designing stickers.
It is OpenAI’s attempt to build on the consumer success of ChatGPT, which introduced the world to generative AI last year, dazzling users with its ability to write humanlike prose and poetry. ChatGPT quickly became one of the fastest growing apps ever, but growth declined when some schools were out of session and the chatbot’s novelty wore off.

But in December, OpenAI delayed the launch of the GPT store, citing in an internal memo it was continuing to “make improvements” to GPTs based on customer feedback. The delay came against the backdrop of the surprise ouster of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman by the company’s board and his reinstatement when employees threatened to quit.
In addition, OpenAI said on Wednesday it is launching ChatGPT Team, a version of ChatGPT that companies pay for so their employees can use ChatGPT at work. ChatGPT Team segregates a company’s data, so any information entered into the chatbot remains private to the company.

CES 2024: Amazon wants to replace the manual in BMW cars with AI and more,"Alexa is also getting an AI upgrade with new skills for music, games, and more.","This year at CES 2024, it wasn’t laptops or electric vehicles that stole the spotlight – it was artificial intelligence. A number of companies announced new ways they are integrating AI into their products, with Amazon unveiling several new third-party Alexa experiences leveraging generative AI. From AI chatbots to music creation tools, Amazon is showing how voice assistants like Alexa can become more useful with the power of large language models.
Partnership with BMW to replace the car manual
One of Amazon’s most intriguing announcements was a partnership with BMW to replace the need for a physical car manual. New Alexa capabilities will allow BMW owners to get to know their vehicle through natural conversation. Rather than digging through complicated manuals, you can simply ask Alexa for recommendations on BMW drive modes or how specific features work. Alexa will respond conversationally with easy-to-understand explanations tailored to BMW cars. This technology aims to simplify the learning curve of features for new BMW owners.

HyperOS review: Xiaomi sets new Android benchmark in fluidity,Xiaomi has nailed easy personalisation with the Xiaomi 13 Pro's new HyperOS update.,"After testing dozens of Android phones over the past year, I can confidently declare that none come anywhere close to the sheer fluidity that MIUI delivers on the Xiaomi 13 Pro. Surprised? I was too when I tested the skin out for the first time on the Xiaomi 13 Pro. As it turns out, the MIUI experience is vastly different between budget and high-end devices. On cheap handsets, you get a slimmed-down version with an unadorned UI and skimpy animations that somehow still manage to stutter.
But on the Xiaomi 13 Pro, it’s silky smooth – you’d be hard-pressed to find lags across the interface no matter how hard you push the phone. Plus it’s all the more impressive that this has been achieved despite resource-heavy iOS-style animations all over. Fancy animations that you simply won’t find on other Android skins. And just when I thought Xiaomi had topped out on fluidity, along comes HyperOS.

Webb telescope may have discovered auroras on a distant ‘failed star’,Scientists used the James Webb Space Telescope to discover a brown dwarf that may have auroras in its atmosphere.,"Astronomers used the James Webb Space Telescope to find a brown dwarf with infrared emission from methane. This is unexpected because the brown dwarf, larger than Jupiter and smaller than a star, is cold and does not have a host star. The researchers propose that the methane may be there due to processes generating auroras.
To solve the enigma of methane on the planet W1935, scientists turned to our solar system. Methane emissions are fairly common from gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter. The upper-atmosphere heating that causes the emissions is linked to aurorae.

Tata to announce semiconductor fab investment in India’s Gujarat,Chip manufacturing is a key plank of Modi's business agenda.,"Tata Group is close to announcing plans to build a new semiconductor fabrication plant in India’s Gujarat state this year, Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said on Wednesday at an investment summit.
The comments came at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, a business event being held in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state in one of his last major efforts to draw investments before a re-election bid.
Chip manufacturing is a key plank of Modi’s business agenda, but initial bids to offer $10 billion in incentives to the chipmaking industry have floundered, with some proposals stalled or cancelled.
Tata Group “is on the verge of concluding and announcing a huge semiconductor fab in Dholera (of Gujarat), and we are about to complete this negotiations and start in 2024,” Chandrasekaran said.
Tata Group will also begin construction of a 20 gigawatts battery storage factory in Gujarat in the next couple of months, he added.

Researchers used new AI methods to screen the 32 million materials and found over 500,000 stable candidates. But identifying half a million candidates is just the beginning.

Eagle-eyed testers of early Windows 11 builds have spotted references to a new “Cowriter” feature, which appears to leverage AI similarly to the AI image generation tools already rolled out in Paint and other apps. The same credits system used in Paint is referenced, hinting that Cowriter may start as a free preview before requiring purchase of credits.
Other references found point to a waitlist for access and marketing images showing the Cowriter icon in Notepad’s toolbar, matching the style used for Copilot in Office apps.

It wasn’t long ago that Notepad was a decades-old utility untouched by modernization. But Microsoft has been updating it for Windows 11 with long-requested features like dark mode, tabs, autosave and more.
Cowriter would take Notepad into new territory as an AI-powered writing assistant.

"Sony Float Run review: Open headphones, with a twist",Sony Float Run takes the concept of open ear headphone and combines it with innovative formfactor to create a truly unique wireless earphone experience.,"As I waited for my dad to step out of the shop, a lady approached me and politely said, “Sir, can you step aside? We need to park our car.” I nodded my head, removed my TWS from my right ear, and made way for the car to park. That day, I recalled a similar incident that had happened when a gentleman sitting next to me on the Metro asked me to vacate a seat for an elderly person, but I barely understood his words. You may blame me for being ignorant, but the truth is when you wear truly wireless earbuds and listen to music, they simply cancel the noise and cut you off from the outside world. However, Sony’s new Float Run wireless headphones are different.
They have an open design, which allows outside sounds to pass through your ears, making you aware of your surroundings. Because they are designed differently from traditional wireless earbuds or any headphones available on the market, I wanted to give them a try and understand whether this concept actually works. Here is my review of the Sony Float Run.

"Microsoft’s OpenAI investment risks EU merger probe, EU regulators say","Microsoft last year committed to invest over $10 billion into OpenAI with a non-voting position on the board, has said it does not own any portion of OpenAI.","Microsoft’s financial backing for ChatGPT maker OpenAI may be subject to EU merger rules, EU antitrust regulators said on Tuesday, underscoring a similar warning from its UK peer in December. The U.S. software giant, which last year committed to invest over $10 billion into OpenAI with a non-voting position on the board, has said it does not own any portion of OpenAI.
The European Commission had previously said it was following developments closely.
“The European Commission is checking whether Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation,” the EU executive, which acts as the EU competition enforcer, said in a statement.
It said some agreements agreed between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers were being investigated for their impact on market dynamics. It did not name the companies.

Scientists create green sustainable fuel from whisky distilling waste,"Scientists have used the wastewater from a whisky distillery to create green hydrogen, a sustainable fuel.","This really should not be taken for an excuse to drink more but researchers at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh used wastewater from the whisky distilling industry to produce green hydrogen, which is a type of sustainable fuel.
They did this by developing a new nanoscale material — a particle is about one-10,000thd the diameter of a human hair. This allowed distillery wastewater to replace fresh water in the green hydrogen production process. This nanoparticle is called nickel selenide and it treats the wastewater. This produced similar or slightly higher quantities of green hydrogen compared to fresh water, according to the university.

"OpenAI fires back at NYT copying allegations, calls claims ‘without merit’","At the same time, OpenAI is ""hopeful"" for partnership with the publication despite legal feud.","OpenAI has publicly responded to a copyright lawsuit filed by The New York Times, calling the case “without merit” and alleging that the publication “intentionally manipulated” its chatbot to regurgitate entire lines from its articles. At the same time, OpenAI also expressed hope to still partner with the media outlet.
In a blog post published Tuesday, OpenAI asserted the Times “is not telling the full story” in its legal complaint. The artificial intelligence company took particular issue with claims that its ChatGPT tool frequently reproduced Times stories verbatim, arguing the newspaper deliberately manipulated prompts to generate regurgitated article excerpts.

What does it mean to be ‘Wi-Fi 7 Certified’? A look at the evolution of Wi-Fi technology,"Wi-Fi 7 can combine 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands to offer much higher data transfer rates.","Today, Wi-Fi connectivity is often taken for granted, yet its absence can swiftly make our lives significantly more challenging. From coffee shops to airports, Wi-Fi is the first thing that we look for. Wi-Fi Alliance (a non-profit consortium that promotes Wi-Fi) at the ongoing CES 2024 introduced ‘Wi-Fi Certified 7’, the next-generation Wireless Fidelity standard, which offers improved connectivity and enhanced wireless networking.
Just two decades ago, Wi-Fi wasn’t this popular. Although there were a few personal computers (laptops) like the iBook G3 with Wi-Fi (AirPort) capability, not many places offered a Wi-Fi Hotspot. Post the launch of laptops featuring Intel’s Centrino mobile technology which included a low-powered Wi-Fi modem based on IEEE’s 802.11b technical specifications, Wi-Fi technology became popular among the masses. IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a professional association based out of New York.

Sony drives its Afeela EV onto stage with PS5 controller,"The Afeela is a concept car, but it's getting closer to reality.","At CES 2024, Izumi Kawanishi, President and COO of Sony Honda Mobility, pulled a PS5 DualSense controller like a gun out of its holster and used it to drive the Afeela electric car on stage, stunning the audience with the unconventional stunt.
The Afeela is a concept car, but it’s getting closer to reality. Developed jointly by Sony and Honda, the concept was originally stated to have 400kW (536hp) dual-motor all-wheel-drive, 0-100km/h in 4.8 seconds, and a top speed of 240km/h. As far as we know, those are still the specs Sony is aiming for. Sony has shown off the Afeela at previous CES events too revealing further details about the car’s development each time – and this time was no different.

"Falling in love changes our brain, finds new study","A new study has found that falling in love can change the way your brain works, making you put your loved one on a pedestal.","We already know that being in love changes the brain by releasing the so-called “love hormone” oxytocin. A new study has found out that when we are in love, our brain reacts differently, making the object of our affections the centre of our lives.
Researchers from The Australian National University (ANU), the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia (UniSA) worked together to measure how a part of the brain is responsible for putting our loved one on a pedestal when we fall in love. The study published in the journal Behavioral Science investigated the link between the human brain’s “behavioural activation system” and romantic love.

"Your bottle of water may contain 2,40,000 plastic pieces, finds study","We already knew that bottled water contained microplastics but how much? A new study indicates a litre of bottled water may contain as much as 2, 40,000 miniscule plastic pieces.","The packaged bottle of water you drink may be advertised as having come from pristine springs but it may be far worse than you imagined. New research has, for the first time, detected and categorised how nearly quarter million invisible pieces of tiny nanoplastics can be present in the average litre of bottled water.
It was no mystery that bottled water contains microscopic plastic pieces but we did not quite know how many were present and of what kind until researchers from Columbia University and Rutgers University did the calculations. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, the researchers documented how the particle level is between 1,10,000 and 4,00,000 plastic pieces per litre, with the average being around 240,000.

Samsung flags bigger-than-expected Q4 profit drop on weak demand,"A recovery for memory chips is expected this year as prices rebounded in the December quarter after production cuts, with the trend expected to continue.","Samsung Electronics Co Ltd reported a likely 35% drop in fourth-quarter operating profit on Tuesday, much worse than analysts expected as weak consumer demand persisted in many of its businesses even as memory chip prices improved.
The world’s largest memory chip, smartphone and TV maker estimated its operating profit fell to 2.8 trillion won ($2.13 billion) in October-December from 4.31 trillion won a year earlier
The profit missed a 3.7 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate, weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.
Lower-than-expected profit from Samsung’s chip contract manufacturing, mobile processors, television and home appliance businesses may have caused Samsung to fall short of forecasts, analysts said.
Rival LG Electronics on Monday flagged fourth-quarter operating profit of 313 billion won, well below estimates due to intensifying competition and higher spending on marketing in the television and home appliance markets to revive consumer demand, which has been hurt by high inflation.
“The only thing that has improved is memory chips, and that’s because Chinese PC and mobile makers began restocking memory chips in fourth quarter after using up their own stocks for so long,” said Lee Min-hee, analyst at BNK Investment & Securities.
“Consumer demand is still not great, and unless interest rates are lowered and the economy stimulated, it may not improve much.”

Samsung’s mobile business likely saw shipments of its two flagship foldable models fall about 1 million units each versus the third quarter, leading to a slight dip in earnings, analysts said.

MEMORY REBOUND
Despite being weaker than expected, this is Samsung’s smallest on-year profit drop in five quarters, after reporting a 31% drop in the third quarter of 2022, as a memory chip glut from slow demand for gadgets caused a severe industry downturn last year.
Samsung’s chip division likely reduced its fourth-quarter loss versus the 4.36 trillion won and 3.75 trillion won in the second and third quarters, analysts said, with its memory chip earnings improving with DRAM business returning to a profit.
A recovery for memory chips is expected this year as prices rebounded in the December quarter after production cuts, with the trend expected to continue.

Mobile DRAM chip prices rose an estimated 18%-23% during the fourth quarter, while mobile NAND flash chip prices rose 10%-15%, according to data provider TrendForce.
Shares in Samsung Electronics opened up 1.2%, but pared gains to trade 0.1% up on Tuesday morning versus a 0.6% rise in the wider market.
The company is due to release detailed earnings on Jan. 31.

Volkswagen presented its first vehicles featuring ChatGPT, to be available for customers in North America and Europe from early in the second quarter of this year, at the CES electronics trade fair.
From raising the temperature when it hears “I’m feeling cold” to showing the nearest Indian restaurant upon hearing “I want butter chicken”, the AI can recognise and respond to a range of demands, according to executives from Volkswagen and Cerence, who partnered with Volkswagen on the technology.
Customers can now adjust functionalities from their vehicle without touching a button, Kai Gruenitz, the Volkswagen brand’s board member for technical development, told Reuters on the sidelines of the CES trade fair.

“Our customers don’t want to manually adjust their seats … they want to use speech dialogue systems,” he said.
Critics say adding generative AI in vehicles, though a step forward from the interactions possible today, is far behind the AI leap that was expected a few years ago, especially with fully autonomous vehicles. Automakers disagree.
“So if you have Apple CarPlay or Android or something, you are not able to adjust functionalities inside of the vehicle. That’s the next step,” Gruenitz said. “I think what our customers are really looking for is seamless, intuitive usage of their car.”

Unity Software to cut 25% of staff in ‘company reset’ continuation,The layoffs come shortly after interim CEO Jim Whitehurst announced a “company reset” in November.,"Videogame software provider Unity Software will target laying off approximately 25% of its workforce, or 1,800 jobs, the company said in a regulatory filing and internal company memo on Monday.
After the announcement, Unity shares were up nearly 5% in after-hours trading.
This is the San Francisco-based company’s largest layoff ever, with completion expected by the end of March, the company said. While Unity is not widely recognized outside the gaming industry, over 1.1 million game creators rely on its software toolkit each month, including the maker of the popular “Pokemon Go,” “Beat Saber” and “Hearthstone” games.
Monday’s deep job cuts will affect all teams, regions and areas of the business, the company told Reuters.
The layoffs come shortly after interim CEO Jim Whitehurst announced a “company reset” in November.
“We are … reducing the number of things we are doing in order to focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability,” Whitehurst wrote in the memo to all Unity employees on Monday.
While Whitehurst provided no specifics on structural changes to come, a company spokesperson confirmed there will be additional changes coming. This is the fourth round of layoffs the company has conducted since July 2022.
ADVERTISEMENT
The layoffs and company reset follow a tumultuous period for Unity.
In September last year, the company tried to impose a new “runtime fee” pricing policy, which charged new fees to its game developers if certain revenue and install thresholds were met. Following a developer revolt and a steep dropoff in share price, the company revamped the new fees.
Following the controversy, then-Unity CEO John Riccitiello retired, and the company appointed former IBM president Whitehurst as interim CEO and president and Sequoia Capital partner Roelof Botha as board chairman.
In November, Whitehurst announced the first part of the company reset, which included terminating an agreement with a visual effects company founded by the “Lord of the Rings” director, closing offices and no longer mandating employees work from offices. Monday’s layoff is the second part of the company reset.
ADVERTISEMENT
Unity was founded nearly two decades ago by three Danish engineers, and gained popularity among game developers for its “game engine” that makes it simpler to develop and publish games across different platforms, such as via mobile or virtual reality.
It is also used in other industries like film and automotive for 3D visualization and virtual reality. After its IPO in 2020, Unity’s stock reached a peak of around $200 in November 2021, but subsequently fell below $30 last year.
Its shares have jumped nearly 40% since Whitehurst announced the company reset.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/unity-software-to-cut-25-of-staff-in-company-reset-continuation-9101072/,technology

Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro first impressions: Another attempt towards ‘mainstreaming’ gaming smartphones,"Asus has made some bold changes to the ROG Phone 8 Pro, and I'm loving it.","While some of its competitors are going for completely flat backs and unobstructed screens with under-display cameras, Asus decided it was time to ditch those awesome front-firing speakers and go for a more ‘normal’ combo of bottom-firing speakers and an earpiece. But in making that move, Asus has finally freed the ROG Phones from bezels for the first time. And that’s just one of many changes Asus has made to the ROG Phone this year.
The bezels, quite surprisingly, were near-symmetrical all around. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/The Indian Express)
The ROG Phone 8 series is taking a more “mainstream” approach in 2024, aiming to appeal to a wider set of smartphone users rather than just the niche pro-gamer crowd. Aside from slimmer bezels, Asus has upgraded the cameras to include a telephoto lens for the first time, added wireless charging, and toned down the gamer aesthetic for a more mature look. But that’s not all – the phones are also slimmer, lighter, and now IP68 water and dust-resistant, a big step up from the basic IP54 rating of the previous models.

First US lunar lander in more than 50 years rockets toward moon with commercial deliveries,"The Pittsburgh company aims to be the first private business to successfully land on the moon, something only four countries have accomplished. But a Houston company also has a lander ready to fly, and could beat it to the lunar surface, taking a more direct path.“First to launch. First to land is TBD,"" to be determined, Thornton noted.","The first U.S. lunar lander in more than 50 years rocketed toward the moon Monday, launching private companies on a space race to make deliveries for NASA and other customers.
Astrobotic Technology’s lander caught a ride on a brand new rocket, United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan. The Vulcan streaked through the Florida predawn sky, putting the spacecraft on a roundabout route to the moon that should culminate with an attempted landing on Feb. 23.“So, so, so excited. We are on our way to the moon!” Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton said. The Pittsburgh company aims to be the first private business to successfully land on the moon, something only four countries have accomplished. But a Houston company also has a lander ready to fly, and could beat it to the lunar surface, taking a more direct path.“First to launch. First to land is TBD,” to be determined, Thornton noted.
NASA gave the two companies millions to build and fly their own lunar landers. The space agency wants the privately owned landers to scope out the place before astronauts arrive while delivering NASA tech and science experiments as well as odds and ends for other customers. Astrobotic’s contract for the Peregrine lander: $108 million.
The last time the U.S. launched a moon-landing mission was in December 1972. Apollo 17’s Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt became the 11th and 12th men to walk on the moon, closing out an era that has remained NASA’s pinnacle. The space agency’s new Artemis program — named after the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology — looks to return astronauts to the moon’s surface within the next few years. First will be a lunar fly-around with four astronauts, possibly before the end of the year.
Highlighting Monday’s moonshot was the long-delayed initial test flight of the Vulcan rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The 202-foot (61-meter) rocket is essentially an upgraded version of ULA’s hugely successful workhorse Atlas V, which is being phased out along with the company’s Delta IV. Jeff Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin, provided the Vulcan’s two main engines.
ULA declared success once the lander was free of the rocket’s upper stage, nearly an hour into the flight. “Yee-haw!” shouted chief executive Tory Bruno. “I am so thrilled, I can’t tell you how much.”
The Soviet Union and the U.S. racked up a string of successful moon landings in the 1960s and 70s, before putting touchdowns on pause. China joined the elite club in 2013 and India in 2023. But last year also saw landers from Russia and a private Japanese company slam into the moon. An Israeli nonprofit crashed in 2019.

Next month, SpaceX will provide the lift for a lander from Intuitive Machines. The Nova-C lander’s more direct one-week route could see both spacecraft attempting to land within days or even hours of one another.
The hourlong descent to the lunar surface — by far the biggest challenge — will be “exciting, nail-biting, terrifying all at once,” Thornton said.
Besides flying experiments for NASA, Astrobotic drummed up its own freight business, packing the 6-foot-tall (1.9-meter-tall) Peregrine lander with everything from a chip of rock from Mount Everest and toy-size cars from Mexico that will catapult to the lunar surface and cruise around, to the ashes and DNA of deceased space enthusiasts, including “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.
The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because of the human remains. saying it would be a “profound desecration” of a celestial body revered by Native Americans. Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to try to find “a good path forward” with the Navajo for future missions. One of the spaceflight memorial companies that bought room on the lander, Celestis, said in a statement that no single culture or religion owns the moon and should not be able to veto a mission. More remains are on the rocket’s upper stage, which was boosted into a perpetual orbit around the sun reaching as far out as Mars.

Cargo fares for Peregrine ranged from a few hundred dollars to $1.2 million per kilogram (2.2 pounds), not nearly enough for Astrobotic to break even. But for this first flight, that’s not the point, according to Thornton.“A lot of people’s dreams and hopes are riding on this,” he said.

"How to remove bloatware apps from Samsung, Realme, Xiaomi, Vivo and Redmi smartphones",Smartphone companies often ship Android phones with pre-installed apps you might never use. Here's how to remove or disable and regain system resources.,"Smartphone manufacturers often pack new Android phones with several apps that you might never use. Often referred to as ‘bloatware’, these apps can be anything from Netflix to Candy Crush Saga, depending on what the user seems useless.

Under a Thousand: Majorly value for money for those seeking a fast charging power bank on a budget!,"Stuffcool, to its credit, has managed to add some style to the Major and it is easy to carry around (you can easily take it on a flight).","There was a time when a power bank with 10000 mAh capacity was considered massive, and would cost a pretty penny. Those days are fortunately behind us and today, it is not difficult to get a power bank with that capacity from a relatively known brand for under Rs 1000. However, with this capacity and lower price, there tend to come a few compromises – the most notable of which are design and charging speed. Low-priced power banks from well-known brands tend to be clunky by design and/or charge at relatively slow speeds (generally around 10W).
The Major power bank from Stuffcool is a welcome change in this regard. The Major has two capacity variants – 20000 mAh and 10000 mAh. The 20000 mAh one is priced at Rs 1499, while the 10000 mAh one comes for Rs 999. We have been using the 10000 mAh variant for a few days now and we have no hesitation in calling this perhaps the best power bank you can get for under a thousand Rupees in terms of balancing both capacity and charging speed.

WhatsApp safety guide: 3 tips to keep your account protected,Follow these simple tips to stay away from most WhatsApp Scams.,"WhatsApp scams have become rampant over the last few years.

Why Nintendo’s next console won’t be too different from the Switch… an expert explains,"If history tells us anything, Nintendo has always bucked market trends despite many predicting the company’s doom.","When Nintendo unveiled the Switch in 2017, the company ditched the usual playbook and instead introduced a new type of console that the world had never seen. Its hybrid TV-handheld nature made the Switch an instant hit, turning it into one of the most compelling consumer devices in a long time. Fast forward to 2024, and as the wait for Nintendo’s next console grows longer, millions of die-hard fans are wondering whether the company will release a Switch 2 or an entirely new console based on an unexplored concept.
The Japanese gaming giant is known for experimenting with designs and making daring choices that do not always turn into a hit. However, its next console may not be as bold as the original Switch was in its time. That’s according to Dr Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, who believes Nintendo is more likely to add subtle changes to the current Switch rather than launch something completely new.

Japan-led XRISM mission reveals its first X-ray picture of cosmos,"XRISM, the ambitious Japanese-led mission, gave us a sneak peak into what its science operations will reveal over the years.","The Japanese-led XRISM (X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) on Saturday released a first look at the data that scientists expect it to collect when science operations begin this year.
The mission team revealed an image of hundreds of galaxies and a spectrum of stellar wreckage in a nearby galaxy, which can tell scientists what they are made of.
“XRISM will provide the international science community with a new glimpse of the hidden X-ray sky. We’ll not only see X-ray images of these sources but also study their compositions, motions, and physical states,” said Richard Kelley, the US principal investigator for XRISM at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, via a statement.
In case you are wondering, XRISM is pronounced “crism,” and it is led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in collaboration with NASA and the European Space Agency. The space observatory is designed to detect X-ray radiation with energy up to 12,000 electron volts. To put that into context, the energy of visible light is between two to three electron volts. Therefore, it is designed to study the hottest regions in the universe, along with its largest structures and the objects with the strongest gravity.

XRISM is carrying just two instruments — Resolve and Xtend — and each of them focuses of the same X-ray Mirror assembly. Resolve is a microcalorimeter spectrometer, and it sits inside a refrigerator-sized container of liquid helium at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. X-rays warm the device by an amount related to its energy. Scientists can use the measure of each individual X-ray’s energy to glean knowledge about the source.
The mission team used Resolve to study N132D, which is a supernova tenant and one of the brightest sources of X-rays in the Large Magellanic Cloud. That is a dwarf galaxy that is about 160,000 light-years away from us in the constellation Dorado. This expanding wreckage was created when a star around 15 times the Sun’s mass ran out of fuel, collapsed and exploded over 3,000 years ago.

Xtend, the mission’s second instrument, is an X-ray imager with a large field of view, able to observe an area about 60 per cent larger than the average apparent size of the full moon. Scientists used Xtend to capture an X-ray image of Abell 2319. That is a rich galaxy cluster that is about 770 million light-years away in the northern constellation Cygnus.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/japan-jaxa-xrism-x-ray-universe-images-9097544/,technology
"Mission to study Sun: After 127 days, how Aditya-L1 will manoeuvre to arrive at desired destination today",Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space-based observatory launched to study the Sun from a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point.,"After a journey of 127 days, the Aditya-L1 spacecraft, India’s first solar mission, will enter the final orbit today afternoon, its desired destination from where it will make observations of the Sun for the next five years.
The spacecraft has to get into an orbit around the L1 (Lagrange 1) point, one of the five locations in the Earth-Sun system where the gravitational effects of the two roughly cancel each other out. It is a relatively stable point for a spacecraft to be parked, and make observations of the Sun.
However, getting into the orbit around L1 is not the same as attaining an orbit around any other planetary body, and is being considered the most important challenge in this mission. The spacecraft will spend the rest of its mission life “orbiting around L1 in an irregularly-shaped orbit in a plane roughly perpendicular to the line joining the Earth and the Sun,” an ISRO scientist said.

“First, acquiring the orbit around L1 is a challenge itself and then maintaining the orbit is also another task,” Dr M Annadurai, former ISRO scientist and project director on the Chandrayaan 1 mission, said.
“It is not like an orbit around other planetary bodies. There are three dimensions to the orbit while other orbits around a planet are two dimensional — equator or polar. The gravitational effects of both the Sun and the Earth play a role and there is constant pulling and pushing,” he added.
Lagrange Points are relatively stable positions but not entirely free from pulls and pressures. However, these are still preferred locations for space missions intending to observe and study the Sun.
“These points in space for a two-body system such as Sun and Earth can be used by the spacecraft to remain at these positions with reduced fuel consumption,” ISRO said in a statement.

“Technically at Lagrange point, the gravitational pull of the two large bodies equals the necessary centripetal force required for a small object to move with them. For two-body gravitational systems, there are a total of five Lagrange points, denoted as L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5. The Lagrange point L1 lies between the Sun-Earth line,” the space agency said.

“The strategic placement at the L1 Lagrange point ensures that Aditya-L1 can maintain a constant, uninterrupted view of the Sun. This location also allows the satellite to access solar radiation and magnetic storms before they are influenced by Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere. Additionally, the L1 point’s gravitational stability minimizes the need for frequent orbital maintenance efforts, optimizing the satellite’s operational efficiency,” ISRO has stated.
“Aditya-L1 will stay approximately 1.5 million km away from Earth, directed towards the Sun, which is about 1 per cent of the Earth-Sun distance. The Sun is a giant sphere of gas and Aditya-L1 would study the outer atmosphere of the Sun. Aditya-L1 will neither land on the Sun nor approach the Sun any closer,” ISRO said.
A suite of seven payloads on Aditya L1 are expected to provide crucial information to understand the problems of coronal heating, Coronal Mass Ejection, pre-flare and flare activities, and their characteristics, dynamics of space weather, study of the propagation of particles, and fields in the interplanetary medium.

“Using the special vantage point of L1, four payloads will directly view the Sun and the remaining three payloads will carry out in-situ studies of particles and fields at the Lagrange point L1,” ISRO said.
The Aditya L1 mission was launched on September 2, 2023, by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C57) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC)at Sriharikota.
After a flight duration of 63 minutes and 20 seconds, the spacecraft was successfully injected into an elliptical orbit of 235 x 19,500 km around the Earth. The spacecraft underwent four earth-bound orbital manoeuvres before it was placed in the transfer orbit towards the Lagrange point L1 on September 19, 2023. On October 6, 2023, ISRO carried out a trajectory correction maneuver on the spacecraft to keep it on course for L1.
“It was needed to correct the trajectory evaluated after tracking the Trans-Lagrangian Point 1 Insertion (TL1I) manoeuvre performed on September 19, 2023.  TCM ensures that the spacecraft is on its intended path towards the Halo orbit insertion around L1,” ISRO said. The trajectory correction manoeuvre which involved firing on the onboard engines of the spacecraft for 16 seconds was deemed necessary to ensure the spacecraft reaches its correct location in deep space to ensure that it slots into an orbit around the L1 point.

Unlike missions to the moon which take about three weeks to cover the 384,400 km distance to the moon – once the spacecraft is put on a trajectory to the moon – the deep space missions to Mars (distance of 225 million km) and the Lagrangian Point 1 (distance of 1.5 million km) take several months (Mars around 11 months and L1 around four months). The longer distances that have to be covered require mission planning to incorporate trajectory correction plans using orbit determination calculations to ensure the spacecraft remains on course for its destination in deep space.

"Microsoft, OpenAI hit with new lawsuit by authors over AI training",The lawsuit follows several others filed by fiction and nonfiction writers over the alleged use of their work to train AI programs.,"OpenAI and its financial backer Microsoft were sued on Friday in Manhattan federal court by a pair of nonfiction authors who say the companies misused their work to train the artificial-intelligence models behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT and other AI-based services.
Writers Nicholas Basbanes and Nicholas Gage told the court in a proposed class action that the companies infringed their copyrights by including several of their books as part of the data used to train OpenAI’s GPT large language model.
Representatives for Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the complaint.

"End-to-end encryption: What it is, how it works, and why you need it","You may have heard of end-to-end encryption, but do you know what it means and how it works?","You probably use apps like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram every day. But do you know how these apps keep your messages safe from hackers, spies, or even the app makers themselves? The answer is end-to-end encryption, a powerful technology that scrambles your data so that only you and your intended recipient can read it. In this explainer, we’ll tell you what end-to-end encryption is, how it works, and why it matters.
First, what is encryption?
Encryption is a way of protecting data from unauthorised access or tampering. It works by transforming the data into a secret code that only the intended recipient can decipher. This comes in useful for various cases, such as securing online communications, storing sensitive information, and verifying digital identities.
There are two main types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: one public and one private. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret.
What is end-to-end encryption?
Now that you know what encryption is, it’d be simpler to understand what end-to-end encryption (E2EE) means. The gist is that the term encryption is generally used when referring to the privacy of stored data, while end-to-end encryption protects data as it’s transferred between locations – which is crucial wherever there’s a rapid exchange of information, like in WhatsApp.
In an E2EE-enabled app, only the folks on each end – the sender and receiver – can read any exchanged messages. Not even the messaging service provider. This is because messages get encrypted on your device before being sent and only are decrypted when they reach your intended recipient. So you’ve got complete privacy from snoopers, hackers, and even the company whose service you’re using.
How does end-to-end encryption work?
End-to-end encryption relies on an elegant yet complex cryptographic system to protect data in transit. The key element is asymmetric cryptography, which uses pairs of keys – public and private – to secure communications. The public key encrypts data, while the private key decrypts it.
Here’s how it works: Users on an end-to-end encrypted system like WhatsApp each generate their own public-private key pairs. They widely distribute their public keys, which act like open locks anyone can use to send them encrypted messages. But those messages can only be unlocked and read by someone holding the associated private key.
ADVERTISEMENT
For example, say Alice wants to send Bob a secret message. Alice retrieves Bob’s public key from his profile or a trusted key server. She encrypts her message using this public key and sends the ciphertext to Bob. Bob receives the encrypted message and uses his private key to decrypt it. The private key is closely guarded on his device and known only to him. This creates a secure channel only accessible to the endpoints in the conversation.

Can a third party gain access to a private key?
It’s clear now that end-to-end encryption means only the sender and receiver can read the messages. But what about the private keys? Can they be hacked? The answer is no. This is because the private key is stored only on the user’s device and cannot be shared with anyone else. Meanwhile, the public key is stored on the server, but it cannot be used to decrypt the messages. Therefore, even if a hacker or a service provider breaches the server, they cannot read the messages or access the private key.
What are the benefits and drawbacks of end-to-end encryption?
On the surface, end-to-end encryption seems like an unambiguously good thing – who wouldn’t want their private communications to be secure from prying eyes? But as with most new technologies, the reality is more nuanced.
The core benefit of E2EE is privacy. When done correctly, it prevents anyone except the sender and recipient from accessing the contents of a message. This protects users from hackers, criminals, overreaching governments, and even the companies providing the services. For many, this level of privacy and security is hugely appealing. It enables free and open communication without fear of reprisal.

However, law enforcement and national security agencies argue that the technology hampers their ability to detect dangerous or illegal activities. And they’re not entirely wrong – encryption does make their jobs harder. But many cryptology experts counter that any backdoors or exceptional access created for authorities will inevitably be exploited by others. Strong encryption with no compromises is mathematically the most secure approach.
Another frequent criticism is that E2EE enables criminal or terrorist coordination. But the evidence that encryption has significantly empowered these groups is limited. Bad actors have many other ways to communicate secretly.
There are also some technical drawbacks. E2EE requires more computing resources and makes certain functions like search prohibitively difficult.
On balance, most technologists view end-to-end encryption as a positive development. The boosted privacy and security for billions of communications each day provides utility that far outweighs the downsides. But the technology does require vigilance against potential abuse.
ADVERTISEMENT
Which apps support E2EE?
Due to its many benefits, end-to-end encryption has gone mainstream in the past few years, with many popular communication apps baking the technology into their products. Signal and WhatsApp use E2EE for all chats by default, meaning that only the sender and the receiver can read the messages. Telegram also offers E2EE for secret chats, but its regular chats are not end-to-end encrypted and use a custom encryption protocol that has been criticised by some experts. Facebook Messenger and Google Messages allow users to opt-in for E2EE, but they do not provide it by default for all conversations.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/what-is-end-to-end-encryption-whatsapp-signal-messenger-9097042/,technology
Redmi Note 13 vs Redmi Note 13 Pro+: Is the price gap worth it?,We pit the base Redmi Note 13 against the souped-up Pro+ model. Is the massive price gap justified?,"At Xiaomi’s flashy launch event for its slick new Note lineup, the company trumpeted a major ‘premiumisation’ push across its budget-friendly Redmi sub-brand. Redmi phones have always been synonymous with affordability in India, but the brand has continued marching upmarket, releasing progressively more expensive models. Now, the gap between the entry-level Redmi Note 13 and the top-of-the-line Note 13 Pro+ is wider than ever. Today, we’re pitting the two against each other to see why Xiaomi is charging so much more for the souped-up Pro+ model.
Redmi Note 13 vs Redmi Note 13 Pro+: Design
One glance at the Redmi Note 13’s design and you’d think this phone costs far more than it does. Xiaomi slimmed down bezels to near-symmetry, which they claim are thinner than the iPhone 14 Pro’s. At just 7.6mm thick and 173.5g, the Note 13 is remarkably slim and lightweight compared to rivals.
However, even as it looks and feels premium at this price, the Note 13 isn’t built like a true flagship. The plastic frame and back are dead giveaways next to the premium materials like metal and glass used by more expensive phones. Their luxe finishes just exude quality in a way plastic can’t. Meanwhile, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ utilizes the most premium materials around, with a glass front and back and aluminium frame. It even has curved edges for ergonomic comfort.
Bottom line: The Redmi Note 13 looks and feels premium for the cost but doesn’t match the high-end experience of the pricier Pro+ model.
Redmi Note 13 vs Redmi Note 13 Pro+: Display
You likely won’t notice huge differences between the displays when using the phones side-by-side in normal conditions. Xiaomi claims the Note 13 Pro+ flaunts an extra-sharp 1.5K display resolution. However, anything above 1080p can be extremely difficult to discern on a tiny smartphone screen unless you’re really pixel peeping. The regular Note 13’s 1080p display is plenty crisp. Both also have smooth 120Hz refresh rates, so scrolling and animations should look identical, performance limits aside.
Where you’ll really see the display upgrades is with HDR content. The Pro+ is HDR10+ certified for brighter, more vivid video in supported apps. It also hits a blazing 1,800 nit peak brightness – nearly double the Note 13’s 1,000 nits – which will be obvious outdoors.
Redmi Note 13 vs Redmi Note 13 Pro+: Performance
If there’s one area where the disparity between these two Notes is positively massive, it would have to be raw performance. The Note 13 runs MediaTek’s Dimensity 6080, which is essentially a rebranded version of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 695. This places it firmly in the middle of the pack in terms of overall capabilities – adequate for general day-to-day use but limited in how much you can push it before it starts to choke. And given its asking price of Rs 19,999, the Dimensity 6080 is actually outperformed by several competing devices in the same price segment.
ADVERTISEMENT
Meanwhile, the Pro+ packs MediaTek’s upper-midrange Dimensity 7200 Ultra, about on par with the 3-year-old Snapdragon 870 flagship. You’ll feel the difference in zippier day-to-day use, considering MIUI’s weight. The 7200 Ultra falls far short of MediaTek’s own top-shelf Dimensity 9300 in intensive gaming, but still delivers flagship-level performance in other scenarios.
Bottom line: You’re looking at a massive performance gap here. The Note 13 trades blows with budget phones, while the Pro+ runs with upper-midrange flagships.
Redmi Note 13 vs Redmi Note 13 Pro+: Camera
On paper, the cameras on these two phones don’t seem too different. The Redmi Note 13 rocks a 108MP main shooter, 8MP ultrawide lens, and 2MP macro cam. The Redmi Note 13 Pro+ steps things up with a 200MP main cam, 8MP ultrawide, and 2MP macro. Xiaomi hasn’t given all the sensor details but we know the Pro+’s primary lens features the Samsung 200MP HP3 sensor underneath, which should mean better image quality. Beyond megapixels, Xiaomi says the Pro+ delivers flagship-level photos. We’ll have to test both phones to see the difference, so stay tuned. The ultrawide and macro specs look identical, unless Xiaomi used different sensors.
Redmi Note 13 vs Redmi Note 13 Pro+: Other features
Both Notes pack 5,000mAh batteries but the Pro+ charges insanely fast at 120W versus 33W on the base model. The Pro+ also utilises a superior vibration motor, promising tighter haptics on par with flagships.
ADVERTISEMENT
Verdict
The Redmi Note 13 punches above its weight with a premium design and capable cameras, but make no mistake – the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ feels significantly more upmarket. The Pro+ model justifies its much higher price tag with a sleek glass-and-metal build and blazing-fast performance.
In the end, while both Notes are admirable devices, there’s a reason for the massive price difference between them. The Redmi Note 13 makes some smart sacrifices to meet its budget-friendly price point. But if you’re willing to pay extra, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ delivers an almost flagship-tier experience at a mid-range cost.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/redmi-note-13-vs-redmi-note-13-pro-plus-9096904/,technology
Android users could soon summon ChatGPT by long pressing power button,ChatGPT developers are reportedly working on a new feature that will allow users to set the AI chatbot as the default digital assistant and use it at the press of a button.,"The fastest way to access ChatGPT on an Android phone is by launching the app, but the company is reportedly working on a new feature allowing users to access the AI-powered chatbot at the press of a button.
According to a recent report by Android Authority, the latest version of ChatGPT for Android includes a  new activity named ‘com.openai.voice.assistant.AssistantActivity’ that lets users set ChatGPT as their default assistant. On manually enabling the activity, an overlay appears similar to the app’s voice chat mode that doesn’t take up the entire screen, much like how Google Assistant appears on top of any app.
The report also suggests that the feature might be a work in progress as the animation was half-baked and the activity closed itself before the chatbot popped up. The ChatGPT app for Android also seems to be missing a tag that allows apps to replace the default digital assistant app.
If you are using the old button navigation method, the default digital assistant can be invoked by long pressing the home button. With Google working on bringing its AI chatbot Bard to Google Assistant, ChatGPT might be working on the functionality so users don’t make the switch.

United States to test radical new X-65 aircraft with futuristic controls,DARPA's X-65 aircraft features a revolutionary design that will be used to test a new air control system that could change an entire century's worth of aircraft design paradigms.,"The United States’ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on Tuesday said it plans to build and deploy the experimental X-65 with a radical design to test innovative new flight controls.
Since the Wright brothers flew the first fully controllable aircraft in 1903, virtually every aircraft has used a system of movable, external control surfaces like rudders and flaps for flight control. The X-65 is designed to break this century-old mould by using jets of air from a pressurised source to shape the flow of air over the aircraft’s surface. Removing external moving parts could reduce weight and complexity while improving performance, according to DARPA.
But that is not to say that X-65 will have no moving parts at all. It will actually have both traditional flaps and rudders along with the active flow control (AFC) actuators that will use pressurised air to shape airflow over the plane. The plane’s performance when it uses conventional control surfaces will act as a baseline. For the following tests, DARPA will selectively lock down moving surfaces to use AFC effectors instead.
The unmanned aircraft will weigh over 3 metric tons, have a wingspan that is a little less than ten metres across and could be capable of speeds up to Mach 0.7. Its weight, size and speed are similar to that of a military trainer aircraft, and this could make the test results more relevant to the world of aircraft testing.
The first X-65 is already being built by Aurora Flight Sciences, a subsidiary of Boeing, and is set to roll out in early 2025 when it will have its first flight.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/darpa-x-65-aircraft-futuristic-controls-9096649/,technology

Scientists propose oxygen could hold the key to finding alien technology,Astronomers propose that oxygen levels of a planet can tell whether alien technology signatures (technosignatures) can be found there.,"The search for extraterrestrial or alien life continues stronger than ever and scientists are widening the search to look beyond biosignatures to see if they can find “technological signatures.” We already know the importance of oxygen for life as we know it, but two astronomers propose that it can also be the key to accessing advanced technology at a planetary scale.
The research paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy last month looked into what conditions on a planet can send out signals about the existence of intelligent life that can produce technology. They found that “the atmospheric requirements may be quite stringent,” according to co-author Amedeo Balbi, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy.
Oxygen: For breathing and burning
Apart from its importance in respiration and other life processes, oxygen is also a crucial ingredient in developing fire, the researchers propose. And fire is the hallmark of a civilisation that harnesses technology.
  Technology was developed on Earth thanks to the process of open-air combustion. This elementary process where something burns with fuel and oxygen is crucial for everything from producing tools to building shelter.
How much oxygen is too much?
Interestingly, the level of oxygen required to sustain complex biological life and even intelligence are not as high as the levels needed to develop technology, according to the researchers. This should mean that even if life were to emerge on a planet with oxygen, it might not be able to become a technological species.
“You might be able to get biology—you might even be able to get intelligent creatures—in a world that doesn’t have oxygen but without a ready source of fire, you’re never going to develop higher technology because higher technology requires fuel and melting,” said coauthor Adam Frank, the Helen F. and Fred H. Gowen Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Rochester, in a press statement.
The researchers created the term “oxygen bottleneck” to describe the threshold that separates planets capable of fostering technological civilisation from those that cannot. Essentially, oxygen levels act as a bottleneck that can stop an alien lifeform from developing technology.

So what?
The study looks at a previously unexplored side of the pursuit of extraterrestrial life — there could be a need to prioritise planets that have high oxygen levels when looking for techno-signatures. This could potentially help fine-tune the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/oxygen-alien-life-technology-planets-9096335/,technology
This $139 iPhone case comes with a Blackberry-style keyboard,What if you could turn your iPhone into a BlackBerry with just a case? That's the idea behind Clicks.,"Since the original iPhone’s debut in 2007, Apple’s iconic smartphone has always lacked a physical keyboard. This clean, minimalist design was a major innovation that helped the iPhone disrupt and change the mobile industry. But now, a new company aims to challenge that enduring hallmark by retrofitting a QWERTY keyboard onto the iPhone through an add-on case.
Clicks, a company founded by popular YouTuber Michael Fisher and tech blog founder “CrackBerry Kevin”, has created a keyboard case that straps onto iPhones to give them a physical QWERTY keyboard.

‘The Note still sits in the mid-segment…we are moving with the market’: Xiaomi India CMO on the new Redmi Note 13 series,"With the Redmi Note 13 series, Xiaomi is still sticking to what works best for the brand in India.","Xiaomi, India’s second-largest smartphone maker by market share, is testing consumers’ loyalty towards the brand and buying power with a premium Pro+ variant of its latest mid-range model, the Redmi Note 13, priced at up to Rs 35,999. At its launch event in New Delhi on Thursday, the company demonstrated its efforts to rekindle its relationship with the committed user base and attract new consumers to a product line that made the brand a household name when the smartphone boom started in India a decade ago.
The Redmi lineup was the first to bring Xiaomi into the limelight with smartphones packed with powerful specifications and features but priced lower than what its competitors were charging for similar devices in 2014. Fast forward to 2024, Xiaomi is now selling high-end SKUs of the newest Redmi Note 13 series in the range of Rs 31,999 and Rs 35,999, hoping to find higher profit margins while being hyper bullish in the mid-range segment, where it has succeeded the most.

Hubble finds fierce weather on display on a distant hellish ‘hot Jupiter’,Data from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the incredibly chaotic weather on a distant hellish exoplanet where iron can be found in the form of a gas.,"If you think the weather is a little uncomfortable where you are, perhaps you can take some consolation in the fact that you do not live on WASP-121 b. The Hubble Space Telescope spotted extremely chaotic weather on the planet that orbits very close to its host star that is brighter and hotter than the Sun, announced NASA on Friday.
WASP – 121 b lies about 850 light-years away from us in the constellation Puppis. “Hot Jupiters” are a class of exoplanets that have features similar to Jupiter, but are much closer to their host star. This planet is so close to its star that its upper atmosphere is hotter than 1,800 degrees Celcius. To put that into context, blast furnaces that are used to smelt iron operate between 1,400 and 1,500 degrees Celsius.

"AI to dominate this year’s CES, even without OpenAI’s Altman on hand","OpenAI's influence at the show despite Altman's physical absence is reminiscent of Apple and its founder Steve Jobs, whose clout was felt despite him avoiding the show, with many firms jockeying to display gadgets compatible with the company's sleek products.","OpenAI boss Sam Altman will not appear at the CES trade show in Las Vegas next week. But the generative artificial-intelligence fever his startup set off last year will be on full display as gadget makers race to find consumer uses for the technology.
In devices for the visually impaired, and safety systems involving guns at schools, to facial-recognition software that can assess vitals, and cabin-monitoring systems inside autonomous cars, dozens of companies have planned announcements for the show about how they are building AI into their gadgets.
CES 2024, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs Jan. 9-12.
OpenAI’s influence at the show despite Altman’s physical absence is reminiscent of Apple and its founder Steve Jobs, whose clout was felt despite him avoiding the show, with many firms jockeying to display gadgets compatible with the company’s sleek products.

Altman is widely regarded as the poster child for the AI frenzy that has gripped the tech industry for the past year. He made headlines in November when he was briefly ousted by the ChatGPT maker’s board, and reinstated days later after more than 700 employees threatened to quit and join OpenAI investor Microsoft in solidarity.
Among other projects, OpenAI is working on a secretive AI hardware project with famed former Apple designer Jony Ive, according to media reports.
Funding for generative AI projects exploded last year, surging more than fivefold to $23.78 billion through the beginning of December from 2022, according to PitchBook data.

“It’s the year of AI in everything,” said Maribel Lopez, tech analyst at Lopez Research. “If you don’t have AI in your product, don’t show up, it’s not worth talking about.”

Germany’s Bosch is expected to showcase a near-invisible gun-detection system that will pair video and audio AI for proactive security involving firearms at schools. Japan’s NEC will unveil AI software that enables mobile devices to analyze face patterns and pupil conditions to estimate human vitals and mental state.
A slew of companies is expected to show off how using AI in vehicles is making them smoother and safer for drivers through better in-vehicle virtual assistants and cabin monitors.
The new focus area for automakers after years of investment into autonomous technology that used AI is technology that allows a “hyper personalized” experience while buying and driving cars, said Akash Arora, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group.

“They’re trying to figure out ‘if I could get to this level of customer experience it can really differentiate me in the market,'” he said of companies in the auto industry.
For instance, Cerence, which makes AI-powered virtual assistants, is set to announce a partnership with Volkswagen, and Israel-based Cipia is expected to unveil a system that monitors signs of distraction and drowsiness in drivers. Amazon.com said it will announce a generative AI partnership with BMW, but declined to provide details before the show.
Many automakers are also adopting AI in various stages of production to reduce costs, said Wendy Bauer, vice president of automotive and manufacturing at Amazon Web Services, which counts BMW and Toyota as customers. AI can help carmakers save money by speeding up vehicle development and ensuring better quality checks during manufacturing, she said.
PC and smartphone makers are also likely to showcase how their products use AI, which chipmakers including Intel and AMD are betting will offer a new revenue stream. Microsoft said on Thursday that PCs with a new AI button on the Windows keyboard will be on display at the show.

But it is not clear whether consumers will pay extra for AI capabilities on their computers because these developments perform less obvious tasks than OpenAI’s ChatGPT bot.
“Consumers love ChatGPT, but the consumer benefit of having it on a device isn’t clear,” said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory. “That’s why everyone is going to talk about it – because everyone is scrambling for the consumer utility.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/i-to-dominate-this-years-ces-even-without-openais-altman-on-hand-9096110/,technology

"iPads, mangroves, and aspirations: How Apple is touching lives in India","At Sitaram Mill Compound School, iPads are introduced to students right from kindergarten. While they start with relatively simple applications such as the Book Creator, they move on to more applications as they progress through grades","R
ight in the heart of Mumbai, nestled between towering structures, is the ‘Red Building’ where a quiet revolution is being powered by a little bit of tech and a lot of perseverance. At the Sitaram Mill Compound Mumbai Public School, a 30-minute drive from the Bandra Kurla Complex, a bunch of underprivileged children are rewriting their futures, armed with iPads.
The bright, sunny day makes the red-painted school stand out even more, and what adds to its ambience is students having fun recording each other on iPads, creating content as part of their curriculum. “How can we combat pollution, when our surroundings are not clean?” asked Antara, a Grade 8 student, who was part of the classroom project where each group, called a station, was allowed a topic on pollution. They were required to create videos, posters, and brief presentations on the topic. But for the students it is beyond a classroom project, as this gives them an opportunity to share their perspectives on an issue that is pervasive in their everyday lives.

Vivo X100 Pro review: A photographer’s phone,"Vivo's new flagship X100 Pro has a killer camera system, thanks to a mix of hardware and computational photography.","During the weekend, while cleaning my room, I found a box full of old phones that I had almost forgotten about. I charged them one by one and started fiddling with their cameras. Hours passed by, and I couldn’t help but wonder when we started identifying our phones through their cameras. Now, the first thing I try whenever I receive a new smartphone for review is the camera, and I believe it must be the same for you as well. So when Vivo approached me to review the new X100 Pro, I subconsciously gravitated towards checking its camera first and then the other features.
The camera is the biggest reason why people upgrade to a new smartphone, and Vivo is attempting to make the X100 Pro a smarter camera phone in every sense. Yes, it is a phone, but it feels like I am using a camera embedded in a phone’s body.

Scientists engineer plant microbiome to drastically reduce pesticide use: Study,"Scientists claim they have engineered the microbiome of a rice plant, developing a technology that could potentially reduce our dependence on pesticides.","An international team of researchers claims they have for the first time engineered the “microbiome” of a plant. This was done to boost the prevalence of good bacteria that protect the plant from disease with hopes of reducing the need for environmentally destructive and deadly pesticides.
The research published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday focused on plant microbiomes — the variety of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms that live alongside plants. People are growing more aware about the “gut microbiome” — the microorganisms that live in our digestive systems. These microorganisms influence our metabolism, our immune system and many other parts of our life.
Just like how our microbiome affects us, scientists have been investigating how plant’s microbiomes affect their health and how vulnerable they are to diseases, according to the University of Southampton.
“For the first time, we’ve been able to change the makeup of a plant’s microbiome in a targeted way, boosting the numbers of beneficial bacteria that can protect the plant from other, harmful bacteria. This breakthrough could reduce reliance on pesticides, which are harmful to the environment. We’ve achieved this in rice crops, but the framework we’ve created could be applied to other plants and unlock other opportunities to improve their microbiome. For example, microbes that increase nutrient provision to crops could reduce the need for synthetic fertilisers,” said Tomislav Cernava, co-author of the paper, in a press statement.
Researchers believe that this breakthrough could help reduce humans’ reliance on pesticides that are harmful to the environment. The study focused on rice crops but the framework created by the researchers might also be useful with other plants as well.
Essentially, the study found that one gene in the “ligning biosynthesis cluster” of the rice plant is important in shaping its biome. Lignin is a polymer found in the walls of plants. Interestingly, some plants are made of up to 30 per cent lignin. The researchers found that the deactivation of the gene caused a decrease in the population of some beneficial bacteria.
After that, they looked at an opposite scenario where the gene was over-expressed to produce more of one type of metabolite which is a small molecule produced by the plant during a metabolic process. This, in turn, increased the amount of beneficial bacteria in the plant’s microbiome.

The researchers exposed this engineered plant to a bacteria that is known to cause a disease known as blight in rice crops. The engineered plants turned out to be more resistant to the bacteria than the wild form.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/scientists-engineer-plant-microbiome-9095137/,technology

‘Not chasing DSLRs anymore… smartphones are better with computational imaging’: Zeiss exec on Vivo’s flagship X100 Pro,The Indian Express sat down with Zeiss's Oliver Schindelbeck and Vivo's Keshav Chugh to discuss the story behind the X100 Pro's pro-grade camera.,"“It’s hard to compare these devices, and they are not competitors… if you are an ambitious photographer, you will most likely have both. If you’re a normal consumer, or even a demanding amateur photographer, you will most likely have just one camera or smartphone camera system.” Oliver Schindelbeck, Senior Smartphone Technology Manager at Zeiss Consumer Products, explains why the conversation about whether a DSLR or smartphone camera is better than the other is not important anymore.
“We are not chasing the DSLR camera anymore. These are two very different categories of cameras, and in some aspects, we have surpassed traditional cameras with smartphones, especially in the fields of computation power and imaging,” Schindelbeck tells indianexpress.com in a recent interview on the sidelines of the pre-launch of the Vivo X100 Pro in Hong Kong.

While Tetris has no official ending, these kill screens are caused by the game speeding up so much that the software can’t keep up, creating an overflow glitch. In 2021, an AI program called StackRabbit was the first to accomplish this, but now Gibson has scored a victory for humanity.

Numerous reports on platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter) indicate that affected users are required to force a factory reset and flash a restored image (likely iOS 17.3 beta 1) from a Mac or PC.
Apple released iOS 17.3 beta 2 today, but they temporarily pulled it back due to an issue causing a few devices to be unable to start.
I hope to see a new beta 2 released tomorrow 👀 pic.twitter.com/S036KOklFj
— Beta Profiles (@BetaProfiles) January 4, 2024
Apple has officially halted the distribution of iOS 17.3 beta 2 and is investigating the issue. It is expected that an updated version of iOS 17.3 beta 2 will be released in the coming days. Although not all users who installed iOS 17.3 beta 2 have encountered this issue, it is affecting various iPhone models, including the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and the iPhone 15 series.

The iOS 17.3 update will introduce two major new features—Collaborative Playlist and Stolen Device Protection—which aim to enhance iPhone security, particularly in cases of theft. This enhancement requires password and Face ID authentication to change the Apple ID password or to add or remove Face ID on the iPhone.
Since iOS 17.3 is still in the beta phase, it has not affected a large number of users. Apple is expected to release a few more beta builds before the final stable release for all users. If you are using an iOS 17 beta build, we recommend avoiding the latest version until Apple resolves the boot loop issue. Additionally, it is always important to back up your data before installing any updates to prevent data loss.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-suspends-ios-17-3-beta-2-update-boot-loop-issues-9094500/,technology
India to use SpaceX rocket to launch communications satellite,"GSAT-20 will be the second “demand driven” satellite launch enabled by NSIL. Last year, it facilitated the launch of GSAT-24 whose entire capacity was bought by Tata Play, a Direct-To-Home broadcaster.","Utilising the services of SpaceX for the first time, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will deploy its heavy communication satellite GSAT-20 through the Falcon-9 rocket of the private space agency towards the middle of this year.
GSAT-20, which can enable telecom providers to offer very high-speed Internet services, weighs about 4,700 kg, much heavier than launch capacity of ISRO’s most powerful rocket, LVM-3. For its heavier satellites, weighing more than 4,000 kg, India had been depending on the European launch provider Arianespace. Arianespace’s heavy launch vehicle Ariane-5, however, was retired in July last year and its successor Ariane-6 is yet to make its debut.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/spacex-indian-communications-satellite-9093611/,technology

9 seriously underrated Nothing OS 2.5 features you need to try,I had fun exploring the latest Nothing OS 2.5 update. Here are 10 underrated features you need to try.,"The Nothing OS 2.5 stable update landed on the Nothing Phone 2 last month, and even though you might not notice a huge difference compared to the previous version at first glance, it’s packed with useful little features that make the device even more of a productivity powerhouse. Like with most updates from Nothing, there are a ton of new customization options to play around with. The company is also still finding cool and innovative uses for the illuminated Glyph interface on the back. I’ve been having fun testing the software, and here are possibly some of the most under-appreciated features.
Hide app icons
(Express image)
I’m not fully on board with Nothing’s signature black-and-white aesthetic but I know plenty of people dig it. However, considering Nothing does not paint all icons monochrome, you can use it to hide non-compliant ones, besides the ones you simply don’t use at all. Accessing the hide app icons setting is easy: hold down on the home screen, tap ‘Home settings,’ and navigate to ‘Hide app icons.’ You can then swipe right on the app drawer to reveal the hidden space.

SpaceX launches its first ‘direct-to-cell’ Starlink satellites,"SpaceX launched 21 Starlink satellites on Wednesday, including six ""direct-to-cell"" satellites that can be used to access internet directly using smartphones.","SpaceX on Wednesday launched 21 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit from the Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenber Space Force Base in California. The launch carried the first six Starlink satellites with “Direct to Cell” capabilities that will allow users to directly connect their cell phones to mobile networks without a Starlink terminal.
Essentially the Direct-to-Cell Starlink satellites have advanced modems that act as cellphone towers in space. This could potentially be used to eliminate cell phone service deadzones on the ground. Similar to how network providers work with other network providers in different countries to offer global roaming services to their customers, they would soon be able to partner with Starlink to offer this Direct to Cell service to their customers.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/spacex-starlink-direct-to-cell-9093178/,technology
Earth reached its closest point to the Sun this week,"The Earth reached its perihelion, or the closest point in its orbit around the Sun, on Wednesday.","The Earth’s orbit around the Sun is not perfectly circular. Instead, it is slightly elliptical. This means that the distance between the planet and the star varies by about three per cent over the course of the year. On Wednesday, the Earth reached its perihelion, or the closest point in its orbit to the fiery star.
The exact time of the perihelion was at 6.08 AM IST on Friday. The planet completes one revolution around the Sun every year, this means that it reaches perihelion around the same year. In 2024, that day is January 3. Technically, this is also the day that the Sun appears the biggest in the sky but a three per cent difference in size is pretty much imperceptible to the human eye.

"LG may be done with phones, but its quirkiness lives on with new DukeBox speaker","Meet the DukeBox, LG's retro-futuristic speaker that uses vacuum tubes to create warm, natural sound.","LG was known for its weird but innovative smartphone designs once before it decided to pull out of that market completely. But the company’s still keeping its quirkiness alive in some of its other offerings. With CES 2024 right around the corner, LG is gearing up to unveil a new retro-futuristic speaker system. Let’s take a look.
DukeBox from LG Labs is a high-end speaker system that audiophiles will appreciate for its use of vintage vacuum tube technology to produce an unparalleled warm, natural sound. Vacuum tubes were the norm for amplification until transistors replaced them in the 1960s, but they’ve maintained a following for their rich audio quality. The DukeBox seeks to deliver that beloved tube sound in a strikingly modern form factor, with vacuum tubes visible behind the device’s transparent OLED display panel.

Apple starts 2024 with Barclays downgrade,"Barclays downgraded the stock to ""underweight"" from ""neutral"" and trimmed its 12-month price target by $1 to $160.","Apple fell 3% on Tuesday after Barclays downgraded the shares of the world’s most valuable firm on concerns that demand for its devices from the iPhone to Mac will remain weak in 2024.
Barclays is the second brokerage to have the equivalent of a “sell” rating on the stock, which now has its most number of bearish recommendations in at least two years, per LSEG data.
Apple has been grappling with a demand slowdown since early last year and has forecast holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates. Its performance in China has also been a worry after the revival of local rival Huawei.
“The iPhone 15 has been lackluster and we believe iPhone 16 should be the same,” Barclays said in a client note, pointing to the China weakness as well as subdued demand in developed markets.
The brokerage also warned risks were mounting for Apple’s services business, which has come under the scanner in countries including the United States over app store practices.
The business has often outpaced growth in Apple’s hardware segment in recent years and now accounts for nearly a quarter of the company’s total revenue.

The share drop on Tuesday was set to wipe off about $90 billion from Apple’s market capitalization. The stock rose nearly 50% in 2023 and hit a record high in mid-December amid a wider rally in Big Tech stocks.
Barclays downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “neutral” and trimmed its 12-month price target by $1 to $160. Before Tuesday, Itau BBA’s “sell” was the only bearish rating on Apple since July 2022.
Analysts, on average, rate the iPhone maker “buy” with a median price target of $200. The company trades at about 28.7 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, much higher than the benchmark S&P 500’s 19.8.

Don’t let scammers hack your UPI: 7 crucial ways to stay safe,Security first when using UPI apps: Follow these must-know tips to outsmart cybercrooks and protect your payments.,"Fraudsters are always looking for ways to exploit mobile payment systems and their scams seem to grow increasingly sophisticated each time. Staying safe when using UPI should thus be a top priority. Below, we list seven essential tips to keep your financial information and transactions secure when using UPI apps. Let’s take a look.
Keep your UPI PIN under lock and key
Your UPI PIN is the key that unlocks access to your bank account, so never share it with anyone. Treat your UPI PIN like you would an ATM PIN – it’s meant to be private. Only enter your UPI PIN on the official UPI PIN entry page that pops up in your banking app. Avoid entering it anywhere else, even if asked by customer support. They should never need your PIN.
Confirm who you’re paying to
Before sending money via UPI, double-check that you have the correct recipient name and UPI ID entered. It’s easy to accidentally send funds to the wrong person if you’re not paying attention. Taking an extra moment to verify details can save you a major headache. If the name looks unfamiliar, run it through the recipient to confirm before initiating the transfer.
Stick to the official UPI PIN page
The UPI PIN entry page you see when making transfers looks the same across all UPI apps. That’s because it’s a secure gateway provided by NPCI, the official UPI provider. Only enter your PIN on this page – not on any other site or app. Some scammers may try to mimic the UPI PIN page through phishing links to steal your PIN and access your account. As long as you use the official PIN page within your banking app, your information stays protected.
Don’t download strange apps
If an unknown person contacts you asking to install a screen sharing or SMS forwarding app, just say no. Never download software at the request of someone you don’t know and trust. Such apps may be used to compromise your phone security and gain access to confidential financial information. Only install apps from official app stores or your bank.

Use secure networks for UPI
Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for making UPI payments or accessing your account. Public networks can easily be monitored by hackers looking to steal financial data. Try to make payments over mobile data or the Wi-Fi at your home or office, which are significantly more secure. This prevents snoops from intercepting your sensitive information.
Review transaction history regularly
Make a habit of regularly checking your UPI transaction history for any activity you don’t recognise. You can do this by going through the transaction history on both the UPI apps you use or your bank statement. If you spot transfers you didn’t make, odd payments, or anything else suspicious, report it to your bank immediately. Acting quickly can help prevent financial loss from fraud.
ADVERTISEMENT
Never share financial details publicly
Avoid posting or sharing any sensitive financial information online or via SMS. This includes your UPI PIN, password, account numbers, or any other private details. Legitimate companies will never ask for such info on social media or other public platforms. Providing it gives scammers access to your accounts. Keep your financial activities confidential for security.
Taking these basic precautions will help ensure your money stays where it belongs – in your accounts.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/upi-safety-security-tips-against-fraud-9092179/,technology
Watch video of dawn to dusk on Mars captured by NASA’s Curiosity Rover,These timelapse videos of dawn to dusk on the red planet were captured by NASA's Curiosity Rover.,"Even if it is not functioning, it seems like NASA’s Curiosity Rover will work as a pretty good sundial on the barren Martian surface. At least, that is what you can see from two black-and-white video timelapses of a day on Mars.
Just before the Mars solar conjunction, a period when the Sun is between Earth and Mars, the rover received instructions to record videos. The space agency was holding off sending commands to the spacecraft on the red planet for several weeks during the conjunction because the plasma from the Sun can interfere with radio communications.

9 unknown things Gmail can do you’ll wish you knew sooner,Think you know everything about Gmail? These 9 genius unknown features prove there's always more to learn.,"Since its launch over two decades ago, Gmail has seen a slew of handy additions that have transformed it into the feature-rich email service it is today. But as often is the case, too many features means many of them are out of plain sight, tucked away behind menus in hard-to-find places. You might think you know everything there is to know about Gmail, but we’re betting at least several of the following lesser-known tricks will surprise you.
Unsend emails
(Express image)
We’ve all experienced that stomach-dropping moment when you impulsively fire off an email only to spot a glaring typo or realise you attached the totally wrong file mere seconds later. Before you can even finish mentally kicking yourself, the message is gone, lost to the void of the internet. Luckily, Gmail has a feature to save us from ourselves in these situations. In the General settings menu, you’ll find an option to “Enable Undo Send” that gives you a short cancellation window after hitting send. You can choose between 5, 10, 20, or 30 seconds.
Once enabled, this gives you a brief but vital window of opportunity after sending an email where you can halt that message right in its tracks before it’s delivered. It’d be smart to keep it set at 30 seconds.
Give someone temporary access
(Express image)
What if you need an assistant or colleague to manage your inbox while you’re out on vacation or a work trip? Handing over your password is obviously a no-no, but Gmail’s delegate feature lets you safely grant them temporary access. Delegates can view, send, and delete mails for you but can’t change your password or chat with anyone.
Head to the Accounts and Import section in your Settings and add their email address under “Grant access to your account.” When you return, simply remove them as a delegate and they’ll no longer have access.
Let Gmail spell check for you
We all make typos, it’s part of being human. But spellcheck has your back when your fallible human brain misses errors in the heat of rapid email composition. Before clicking send, click the three dot menu icon in the bottom right corner of the compose window, then click Check spelling. Gmail will automatically scan your message draft and intelligently highlight any spelling errors it catches so you can promptly fix them.
Use Gmail like it’s Snapchat
(Express image)
Did you know that Gmail can be adjusted to behave like Snapchat and send fleeting mails? Using Gmail’s confidential mode feature, your mails can be set to ‘vanish’ after a specified period like a Snapchat text. Mails sent this way also cannot be forwarded, copied, printed or downloaded by the recipient.
ADVERTISEMENT
This is useful when you wish to send confidential information over email while retaining more control over your message even after hitting send.

Set up a vacation auto-responder
A vacation is supposed to be a time for rest and relaxation. But those pesky work emails can quickly ruin your Zen if your boss is bugging you about why you decided to jet off for three months without telling anyone. That’s where Gmail’s super helpful vacation responder comes in.
In Gmail, scroll down to the Vacation responder section and turn it on. Then fill in the date range, subject, and message. There’s also a check box underneath that turns auto-respond on for contacts only.

Customise how many emails you see
Does your inbox feel overwhelming and anxiety-inducing with too many emails visible at once? Or do you need to see more conversations on screen to get a better big-picture view? Lucky for you, Gmail provides options to customise how many emails appear per page.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the General tab of Settings, you can change the default view from 50 conversations per page to whatever number makes you most productive – whether that’s 20 for a minimalist feel or 100 if you’re an email power user. The same goes for contacts per page. Optimising these view settings allows your inbox view to work the way you do.
Colour code with custom stars
(Express image)
The classic yellow star has been around since the early Gmail days, but why not spice up your priority labeling system? Under General > Stars in Settings, you can select from a fun rainbow of colors for stars, like blue, green, red, purple, and yes, yellow too for old time’s sake.
Colour coding your starred mails helps you categorise different types of important messages or priorities in your workflow, helping you make Gmail far more productive at a glance.
Save time with templates
Never waste time manually typing “Thanks, I’ll take a look and get back to you by end of day” in 50 emails again. If you find yourself repeatedly typing the same common replies and greetings, it’s time to unlock one of Gmail’s most time-saving features. In Settings > Advanced, enable Templates. These can be created and inserted through the ‘More options’ menu in the compose toolbar.

New way to identify liquid water on exoplanets could help search for habitable ones,"Scientists have developed a new method to detect water on exoplanets, which in turn could help look for distant habitable worlds.","Scientists have developed a new method to identify habitable planets and potentially inhabited planets by comparing the amount of carbon dioxide in their atmosphere to neighbouring planets. The study shows that if a planet has reduced amounts of carbon dioxide in atmosphere when compared to neighbouring planets, that planet could have liquid water on its surface.
That is because this drop in carbon dioxide implies that some of it is being dissolved into an ocean or maybe even captured by a planet-scakle biomass. Finding out water on exoplanets is an important step towards discovering potentially habitable distant worlds, which is crucial in the search for extraterrestrial life.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/identify-water-habitable-exoplanets-9091967/,technology

Quadrantids 2024: First meteor shower of year set to peak this week,Here is how you can view the Quadrantid meteor shower set to peak this week.,"The Quadrantid meteor shower has been active since December 12 and will continue to be active until January 12. It will produce its peak rate of meteors on January 4, when there is a high chance of viewing meteors when the shower’s radiant point, in the constellation Bootes, is above the horizon.
When seen from New Delhi, the shower will not be visible until 12.07 AM each night, when the radiant point rises above the eastern horizon, according to In the Sky. It will remain active till dawn breaks around 6.46 AM. The peak is expected to happen around 4 PM IST on January 4, 2024. This means that the best displays can be seen around dawn on January 4 and after the radiant rises on January 5.
The Quadrantids meteor shower is associated with the asteroid EH1, which takes about 5.5 years to orbit around the Sun, according to EarthSky. The meteor shower happens when the Earth passes through the trail of debris left behind by the asteroid, which will burn up in our planet’s atmosphere. There is also an interesting story behind its name.
Its name comes from the constellation Quadrans Muralis. It was left off a list of constellations drawn out by the International Astronomical Union in 1922. But since the shower was already named after Quadrans Muralis, its name was not changed. It is also sometimes called Bootids after the modern constellation in which its radiant point is now situated.
To get the best view of the meteor shower, find a secluded viewing spot away from the city lights. Once you are at the location where you are going to observe the meteors, take a little bit of time for your eyes to adjust to the darkness. Once you find a comfortable viewing spot, lay down on the ground and look up at the sky. Use a digital sky map to find out where the radiant of the meteor shower is. The higher it is in the sky, the more meteors you are likely to see.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/quadrantids-meteor-shower-9091664/,technology

I ditched my high-end smartphone for the Lava Storm 5G for a week: Here’s what I learned,Lava Storm 5G is a clean looking entry-level 5G smartphone with a 120Hz display.,"While there is no shortage of good smartphones in the budget segment, it’s still a tedious task to find a device that gets the basics right and offers a holistic user experience. I recently tried the Lava Storm 5G, and it felt like the right budget smartphone. Here is my review.

Design
The subtle-looking Lava Storm 5G reminds me more of the latest Samsung smartphones with its unique-looking camera array, which includes a dual-camera setup and an LED flash designed to resemble a camera. This is clearly one of the simplest and cleanest-looking smartphones in this segment, looking nothing like any of the previously launched smartphones from the company. Unlike the recently released Blaze 2 (review) with its ring light, the Storm has nothing unique to offer in terms of design, and the device seems to cater to those who value substance over style. The phone features a glass sandwich design, making it a bit heavier than its contemporaries, weighing 214 grams. The phone has a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and dual nano SIM card slots with support for a 5G network on both slots.

My wishlist: What Apple needs to fix in 2024,"Apple is currently in a weird position where it needs more than just ""perception"" and ""brand"" to win consumers of the future.","2023 will go down as the worst year for Apple in recent times, for all the obvious reasons. However, history shows that Cupertino has faced even worse situations. Despite its humongous fan following and steady cash flow, the company has experienced a dip in sales of iPhones and other core products, while being engulfed in controversies one after the other. In an industry as hyperactive as this, the smallest mistake could turn into a big controversy, and it takes a few quarters (or probably longer) to make a comeback. Apple is currently in a weird position where it needs more than just “perception” and “brand” to win consumers of the future.

Simplify the iPhone lineup  
The flagship iPhone 15 Pro Max is a great smartphone, and so is the baseline iPhone 15. However, the truth is that they aren’t significantly different from their predecessors. Aside from a few changes here and there, they are essentially the same. You still get the same screen, the same battery life, the same design, and a performance that’s barely any better. While the cameras have improved a bit, it’s not to a level that justifies upgrading unless you have a relatively new model. And that’s the core issue with the iPhone. The fact is, Apple has been releasing repackaged versions of the iPhone since the launch of the iPhone X, with minor tweaks that don’t push the envelope or encourage users like you and me to upgrade faster.

ISRO to usher in 2024 with launch of dedicated scientific satellite to study black holes,"The PSLV-C58 rocket, in its 60th mission, would carry primary payload XPoSat and 10 other satellites to be deployed in low earth orbits.","ISRO is set to welcome the new year with the launch of its first X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite that would offer insights into celestial objects like black holes, onboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket on Monday.
The launch comes after the success of its Gaganyaan Test Vehicle D1 mission in October.
The PSLV-C58 rocket, in its 60th mission, would carry primary payload XPoSat and 10 other satellites to be deployed in low earth orbits.
The 25-hour countdown commenced on Sunday for the lift-off scheduled at 9.10 am from the first launch pad at this spaceport, located about 135 kms east of Chennai on January 1.
“The countdown commenced for PSLV-C58 at 8.10 am today,” ISRO sources said.
The X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) is aimed to investigate the polarisation of intense X-ray sources in space.
According to ISRO, it is the first dedicated scientific satellite from ISRO to carry out research in space-based polarisation measurements of X-ray emission from celestial sources.
ADVERTISEMENT
Besides ISRO, the US-based National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA) conducted a similar study — the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer mission in December 2021 on the remnants of supernova explosions, the particle streams emitted by black holes and other cosmic events.
While space-based X-ray astronomy has been established in India focusing on imaging, and time domain studies, Monday’s mission marks a major value-addition to the scientific fraternity, the space agency said.
The objective of the PSLV-C58 mission includes measuring the polarisation of X-rays in the energy band 8-30 keV emanating from about 50 potential cosmic sources, to carry out long-term spectral and temporal studies of cosmic x-ray sources.
The X-Ray polarisation serves as a crucial diagnostic tool for examining the radiation mechanism and geometry of celestial sources.
ADVERTISEMENT
The primary payload of XPoSat is POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-Rays) which is designed to measure polarimetry parameters by Raman Research Institute and XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing) built by the U R Rao Satellite Centre, Bengaluru. The Mission life is about 5 years.
The space-based study of X-Ray polarisation is gaining utmost importance internationally, and in this context, the XPoSat mission would play a significant role, ISRO added.
XPoSat is anticipated to bring substantial benefits to the Astronomy community globally. Apart from its capability of timing and spectroscopy-based observations, the insights derived from X-ray polarisation measurements on celestial objects like black holes, neutron stars, and active galactic nuclei, hold the potential to significantly improve the understanding of their physics.
The mission is poised to play a pivotal role in building expertise in X-Ray polarimetry in India, providing a foundation for future advancements and fostering a collaborative network within the astronomy community.
ADVERTISEMENT
The 44.4-meter-tall PSLV rocket would first deploy the primary satellite into a 650 km Low Earth Orbit around 21 minutes after lift-off and later the scientists would bring the satellite to a lower altitude of about 350 km by restarting the fourth stage of the vehicle, for conducting the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-3 (POEM-3) experiment.

Sonos Era 300 review: Music that fills the room and your heart,"A very different-looking speaker that reminded me of a percussion instrument, designed to ensure music is spread across the room.","Over the years, some audio brands have established so much trust in users’ minds that it is just a question of how they will awe you with a new product… if they will is rarely a matter of debate. I consider brands like Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, Sonos, etc in this category. So when the Sonos Era 300 came up for review, I was clear I would just need to see how much awe the company can pack in their speaker this time.
The Sonos Era 300 is a very different-looking speaker. It reminded me of a percussion instrument, but I could sense the design was practical, especially since it packed a melange of tweeters and woofers firing off to all sides. Yes, that is exactly what the Era 300 is designed to do, ensure the music is spread across the room, offering a superior surround experience.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/sonos-era-300-review-9089395/,technology

An artist in residence on AI’s territory,"Alexander Reben is taking his tech-savvy perspective to OpenAI, a company that some in the art world believe is a threat to their future.","Written by Leslie Katz
At a reception for OpenAI’s first developer conference in San Francisco last month, a crowd mingled, wine in hand, as withering criticism of art created with artificial intelligence flashed on a blue wall at the front of the room. “I’ve seen more engaging art from a malfunctioning printer,” one critic jabbed. “The fine art equivalent of elevator music,” huffed another. “Inoffensive, unmemorable and terminally dull.”

Well, a fresh discount has now made this already-appealing phone even more compelling, bringing it below the Rs 30,000 threshold that many buyers psychologically key on.

The Copilot app is now officially available for iOS and iPadOS on the App Store for you to download.
To recall, Copilot is Microsoft’s stab at an AI chatbot, similar to ChatGPT or Google Bard. But unlike the other two, this one prioritises searching for information rather than handling lengthy documents. For example, you can use Copilot to ask questions and get real answers from the web, draft emails and smaller articles. It can also create images from your text, using DALL-E 3, a powerful text-to-image generator from OpenAI.

boAT Immortal Katana Blade review: A beast mode earbuds for avid gamers,"When it comes to gaming, picking up the right earbuds can be a tricky affair. We tried on the boAT Immortal Katana Blade and here’s what we think.","This year I have tried close to seven earbuds, and all of them came up with something unique. Some offered stellar audio with hyper-sensitive touch response, while some had a distinct vigour that would make them an enduring pair of earbuds for years to come. My ears have gotten used to in-ear TWS that comfortably stayed in place immersing me in music on the go. Recently, I had the chance to experience boAT Immortal Katana Blade earbuds. The unique name piqued my interest, as Katana always equated to brutal action with blades.
To be honest, I am not a fan of non-in-ear headphones – I have had my reservations. For some, this could be mostly about comfort, which is subjective. I finally laid my hands on the packaging which I found to be edgy and futuristic. It gave me the impression that the makers have put a lot of thought into creating something that is unique and caters to the aesthetic palette of avid gamers.

Study finds gender bias in life science research paper citations,An analysis of life sciences research papers found that gender bias could be playing a role in making women's research less visible.,"Analysis of more than two million life sciences research papers revealed a strong gender bias in citations —- papers with female lead authors got far fewer citations than those led by male authors. This pattern was visible in many life sciences subfields, including those with relatively equitable gender representation.
The authors of the study published in the journal Research Policy say this imbalance is caused in part due to gender specialisation in certain research areas. But another factor may also be important — a researcher’s mentors, co-authors and friends they make at conferences are likely to share their gender identity.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/study-gender-bias-life-sciences-research-9087385/,technology

Google settles $5 billion consumer privacy lawsuit,"The plaintiffs alleged that Google's analytics, cookies and apps let the Alphabet unit track their activity even when they set Google's Chrome browser to ""Incognito"" mode.","Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) has agreed to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of millions of people who thought they were doing their browsing privately.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, put a scheduled Feb. 5, 2024 trial in the proposed class action on hold on Thursday, after lawyers for Google and for consumers said they had reached a preliminary settlement.
The lawsuit had sought at least $5 billion. Settlement terms were not disclosed, but the lawyers said they have agreed to a binding term sheet through mediation, and expected to present a formal settlement for court approval by Feb. 24, 2024.
Neither Google nor lawyers for the plaintiff consumers immediately responded to requests for comment.
The plaintiffs alleged that Google’s analytics, cookies and apps let the Alphabet unit track their activity even when they set Google’s Chrome browser to “Incognito” mode and other browsers to “private” browsing mode.
They said his turned Google into an “unaccountable trove of information” by letting the company learn about their friends, hobbies, favorite foods, shopping habits, and “potentially embarrassing things” they seek out online.
In August, Rogers rejected Google’s bid to dismiss the lawsuit.

She said it was an open question whether Google had made a legally binding promise not to collect users’ data when they browsed in private mode. The judge cited Google’s privacy policy and other statements by the company that suggested limits on what information it might collect.
Filed in 2020, the lawsuit covered “millions” of Google users since June 1, 2016, and sought at least $5,000 in damages per user for violations of federal wire-tapping and California privacy laws.

The Elon Musk-led company’s rocket lifted off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 6.37 AM IST carrying the uncrewed and autonomously operating X-37B space plane.
The launch happened after more than two weeks of delays and aborted starts because of poor weather and some technical issues. The spacecraft was rolled back to its hangar before it took off on Friday. The launch also has a flavour of US-Sino space rivalry according to Reuters because China’s Shenlong or “Divine Dragon” launched two weeks before it.

"Google unveils VideoPoet, a highly versatile multimodal LLM that can generate videos","Google has introduced a new LLM VideoPoet that can make videos from images, texts, and audio.","Just when Midjourney and Dall-E 3 were making remarkable progress in text-to-image, Google introduced a new large language model (LLM) that is multimodal and generates videos. This model comes with video generation capabilities that have never been seen before on LLMs.
Scientists at Google have introduced VideoPoet, which they claim to be a robust LLM that is capable of processing multimodal inputs such as text, images, video, and audio to generate videos. VideoPoet has deployed a ‘decoder-only architecture’ that enables it to produce content for tasks that it has not been specifically trained on. Reportedly, the training of VideoPoet involves two steps similar to LLMs – pretraining and task-specific adaptation. According to the researchers, the pre-trained LLM is essentially the base framework that can be customised for various video generation tasks.

The best gadgets we tested in 2023,"Despite the AI hype, gadgets still mattered in 2023. Here are the devices that caught our eye, from the OnePlus Open to the Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro.","2023 was a rather slow year for gadgets. For the first time in decades, there was more chatter about artificial intelligence taking over the limelight from the everyday gadgets we use, especially smartphones. This was reflected in product launch cycles and the devices that eventually hit the retail shelves. That being said, there were still plenty of gadgets that were not only impressive but also bold in their messaging. From smartphones and laptops to headphones, here are some of our favourite gizmos from the past year.
iPhone 15 Pro Max: Despite complaints that Apple once again did not push the envelope enough, the fact remains that the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the best phone one can buy with unparalleled processing power, camera capabilities and sheer dependability. With Apple pushing towards its own silicon, iPhones are now way ahead of the competition in terms of what a phone can do on its own when it comes to processing power.

"FIU issues notice to 9 offshore crypto platforms, writes to MeiTY for blocking of URLs","Apart from Binance and Kucoin, the other virtual digital assets service providers (VDA SP) who have been issued notice for not registering as reporting entities with the FIU-India are Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfenex.","The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Finance Ministry has issued show cause notices to nine offshore cryptocurrency and virtual digital assets platforms, like Binance and Kucoin, for non-compliance with anti-money laundering law.
The FIU has also written to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block the URLs of these nine entities that are operating illegally without complying with the provisions of the PML Act in India.
Apart from Binance and Kucoin, the other virtual digital assets service providers (VDA SP) who have been issued notice for not registering as reporting entities with the FIU-India are Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfenex.
The virtual digital assets service providers operating in India (both offshore and onshore) and engaged in activities like exchange between virtual digital assets and fiat currencies, transfer of virtual digital assets, safekeeping or administration of virtual digital assets or instruments enabling control over virtual digital assets etc are required to be registered with FIU IND as ‘Reporting Entity’ and comply with the set of obligations as mandated under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002.
The obligation is activity-based and is not contingent on physical presence in India.
The regulation casts reporting, record keeping, and other obligations on the VDA SPs under the PML Act which also includes registration with the FIU IND, the finance ministry said.
“As part of compliance action against the offshore entities, Financial Intelligence Unit India (FIU IND) has issued compliance Show Cause Notices to following nine offshore Virtual Digital Assets Service Providers (VDA SPs) under Section 13 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA),” the ministry said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Under the I-T Act, reporting entities are required to file statements of financial transactions (SFT) with the tax department containing details of certain financial transactions or any reportable account maintained by them during the year.
In March, the government had brought VDA SPs into the ambit of the Anti Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML-CFT) framework under the provisions of PMLA.
Till date, 31 VDA SPs have registered with FIU IND.
However, several offshore entities catering to a substantial part of Indian users were not getting registered and coming under the Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework, it added.
FIU-IND is the central, national agency responsible for receiving, processing, analyzing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions to enforcement agencies and foreign FIUs.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/fiu-notice-9-offshore-crypto-platforms-writes-meity-blocking-urls-9086828/,technology

The ‘SU’ stands for ‘Speed Ultra’ alluding to the fact that the car can accelerate from 0-100kmph in merely 2.78 seconds – a hair faster than the Porsche Taycan Turbo S, which costs several times more than the expected price of the SU7.
But that’s only a sliver of what the car is capable of. The car runs HyperOS, meaning seamless connectivity with Xiaomi phones and accessories. Xiaomi also has lofty ambitions for its new division and plans to break into the top five automakers globally. Does the SU7 have what it takes to set Xiaomi on this path? Let’s take a look.

Redmi 13C 5G review: Recycling the affordable 5G formula,"At Rs 10,999, the phone costs dangerously close to the Redmi 12 5G. But is it a better value proposition? Read on to find out.","The budget smartphone market in India is heating up now that 5G networks are rolling out across the country. After a pretty dull 2022 for budget phones, companies are eager to tap into pent-up demand among cost-conscious Indian consumers who want faster connectivity without breaking the bank.
Sensing a big opportunity, Chinese phone giant Xiaomi has flooded the market with not one but two new cheap 5G handsets – the Redmi 12 5G and now the very similar Redmi 13C 5G. I’ve been testing out the Redmi 13C for over a week now, and in this review, I’ll give you the lowdown on whether Xiaomi’s latest attempt to dominate the budget 5G space is a winner or just more of the same old stuff.

Apple under fire from Indian authorities over ‘state-sponsored attackers’ alert: Report,Apple is under fire from Indian authorities over hacking alerts to journalists and politicians.,"Apple is reportedly facing pressure and scrutiny from Indian officials over the security of its devices and the accuracy of its threat detection algorithms, after it sent alerts to several journalists and opposition leaders in India that their phones may have been hacked by state-sponsored actors.
The Washington Post reported, citing three people with knowledge of the matter, that the government officials were unhappy with Apple’s warnings and wanted the company to find ways to reduce the political damage of its alerts. The official also asked an Apple security expert to suggest alternative explanations for the alerts that would, most likely, not implicate the government as the possible source of the attacks.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-indian-authorities-scrutiny-state-sponsored-attackers-alert-9086335/,technology
"China’s Xiaomi unveils first electric car, plans to become top automaker","The sedan, dubbed the SU7 with the SU short for Speed Ultra, is a highly anticipated model that Chief Executive Lei Jun touted as having ""super electric motor"" technology.","Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi took the wraps off its first electric vehicle on Thursday and promptly announced it was aiming to become one of the world’s top five automakers.
The sedan, dubbed the SU7 with the SU short for Speed Ultra, is a highly anticipated model that Chief Executive Lei Jun touted as having “super electric motor” technology capable of delivering acceleration speeds faster than Tesla cars and Porsche’s EVs.
But the car – likely to go on sale in several months – is making its debut at a time when China’s auto market – the world’s largest – is wrestling with a capacity glut and slowing demand that have stoked a bruising price war.

That didn’t stop Xiaomi Chief Executive Lei Jun from outlining big ambitions.
“By working hard over the next 15 to 20 years, we will become one of the world’s top 5 automakers, striving to lift China’s overall automobile industry,” he said at the unveiling.
Those plans include building “a dream car comparable to Porsche and Tesla,” he added.
The SU7 is also expected to appeal to customers due to its shared operating system with Xiaomi’s popular phones and other electronic devices. Its drivers will have seamless access to the company’s existing portfolio of mobile apps.

“Xiaomi is a well-established consumer electronics brand with hundreds of millions of ‘Mi Fans’, or members of its smart device ecosystem,” said Bill Russo, CEO of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility.
“As such, they have a significant opportunity to break through as the automobile becomes a smart device.”
The SU7 will come in two versions – one with a driving range of up to 668 km (415 miles) on a single charge and another with a range of up to 800 km. By comparison, Tesla’s Model S has a range of up to 650 km.
Pricing has yet to be announced. Lei said the cost would “indeed be a bit high, but one that will have everyone will think is justified.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Amid one of the coldest Decembers for China on record, the SU7 was also being positioned to appeal to consumers worried about winter. Lei said it had fast-charging capabilities in low temperatures and is equipped with advanced tech allowing it to recognise obstacles under challenging conditions such as falling snow.
The autonomous driving capabilities of Xiaomi cars would be at the forefront of the industry, he also said.
Lei’s ambitions failed to boost Xiaomi’s share price however with the company’s Hong Kong-listed stock giving up earlier gains to finish 0.3% lower.
China’s fifth-largest smartphone maker has been seeking to diversify beyond its core business to EVs amid stagnating demand for smartphones – a plan it first flagged in 2021. Other Chinese tech companies that have partnered with automakers to develop EVs include telecoms giant Huawei and search engine firm Baidu.
ADVERTISEMENT
Xiaomi has pledged to invest $10 billion in autos over a decade and is one of the few new players in China’s EV market to gain approval from authorities who have been reluctant to add to the supply glut.
Its cars will be produced by a unit of state-owned automaker BAIC Group in a Beijing factory with an annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles.
In an extremely crowded Chinese EV market, its biggest competition will likely come from BYD which commands a one-third share while Tesla has 9%, according to third-quarter figures from Zheshang Securities.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/chinas-xiaomi-unveils-first-electric-car-plans-to-become-top-automaker-9086353/,technology
Kilonova explosions from neutron star collisions could explain how Earth got gold,"Scientists have developed a new method to model the signs of neutron stars colliding, which can create heavy elements like gold.","An international team of researchers have developed a method to model the observable signs of a kilonova explosion from the explosive merger of two orbiting neutron stars. This could help them describe what exactly happens during a merger, how nuclear matter behaves under extreme conditions and why the gold on Earth must have been created by such cosmic events in the distant past.
The researchers used a new software tool to interpret the many types of astrophysical data from a kilonova explosion. Up until now, many different data sources were analysed separately and the data interpreted using different physical models in some cases, according to the Max Planck Society.
“Our new method will help to analyze the properties of matter at extreme densities. It will also allow us to better understand the expansion of the universe and to what extent heavy elements are formed during neutron star mergers,” explained researcher Tim Dietrich in a press statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Neutron stars are superdense astrophysical objects formed at the end of a massive star’s life in a supernova explosion. Sometimes, neutron stars orbit each other in binary systems. These systems constantly lose energy by emitting gravitational waves until they eventually collide and merge.
Such mergers let researchers study the physical properties of the most extreme conditions in the universe. For example, the conditions of these high-energy collisions lead to the formation of heavy elements like gold.
The researchers applied the new method to “multi-messenger” observations of binary neutron star mergers. In an event that was discovered on August 17, 2017, the stars’ last few thousand orbits around each other had warped space-time enough to create gravitational waves. These waves were discovered by terrestrial observatories like Advanced LIGO and Advanced VIRGO.
Some of the elements created in the merger decayed radioactively. This caused the temperature to rise, sending out electromagnetic signals in the optical, infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, which were discovered up to two weeks after the collision. A gamma-ray burst caused by the merger also ejected additional material.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/neutron-star-collisions-earth-gold-9086046/,technology
2023’s graveyard: The tech we bid farewell to,"Innovation isn't always forever. From Google Glass to WordPad, here's the tech we lost in the relentless march of progress in 2023.","2023 was an especially significant year for the world of tech, with new AI innovations dropping left, right, and centre. But life is not without death – the year also saw the demise of a bunch of tech products that faced insurmountable challenges or simply failed to catch on.
From Google’s visionary but doomed Glass to Lenovo shuttering its Legion gaming phone line, we look back at the innovative yet ill-fated tech that met its end this year. Though full of promise, these pieces of tech could not escape their fate in an unforgiving market.
Read on for the tech that died in 2023.
Google Glass Enterprise Edition

Among the tech products laid to rest in 2023 was Google’s augmented reality headset Google Glass Enterprise Edition, marking the final nail in the coffin for Google’s visionary but ill-fated foray into AR glasses. First publicly announced in 2012, Google Glass was meant to usher in a new era of wearable computing, giving people working in agricultural, medical, and factory settings a heads-up display that would provide them with information while keeping their hands free. But the $1,500 price tag, lack of clear functionality, and privacy concerns doomed the Explorer Edition among consumers.

Google tried to revive Glass for businesses in 2017 with the Enterprise Edition, sold for $999. The headset found niche adoption in fields like manufacturing and medicine, where hands-free computing was useful. But ultimately, Google Glass failed to achieve mainstream success or change how we interact with technology day-to-day.
Lenovo’s Legion Gaming Phone Business

Rumours about Lenovo shutting down its phone business started flying in at the start of the year. Then in March, a Lenovo spokesperson confirmed to Android Authority that it indeed had been shut down. The spokesperson stated that the decision stemmed from “a wider business transformation and gaming portfolio consolidation.”
It seems gaming phones have struggled to carve out a distinct niche as regular flagship phones have gotten better and better at providing great gaming experiences even during long play sessions. Companies tried to attract buyers through gimmicks like cooling fans, RGB lighting and massive amounts of RAM, but to no avail. Lenovo’s Legion gaming phones were well-reviewed devices with top-tier specs, but ultimately couldn’t compete with more mainstream options. The company seems to be shifting focus to handheld gaming devices instead and unveiled the Lenovo Legion Go in September.
The gaming phone market in general seems to be on shaky ground – Xiaomi’s Black Shark division has gone quiet after layoffs in January this year, though brands like ASUS continue to see some success with their ROG Phone series. While they arguably pushed the boundaries of mobile gaming, Lenovo’s Legion gaming phones are yet another piece of tech that did not pan out in 2023.

Amazon Halo Brand

Did you know that Amazon had a line of fitness trackers? Probably not. So it didn’t come as a surprise when Amazon decided to pull the plug on its Halo line of health and fitness trackers in July 2023, marking the end of the company’s attempt to break into the wearables market. Launched in 2020, Halo was Amazon’s play into the competitive fitness tracking space dominated by Apple, Fitbit and others. However, it failed to gain significant traction against entrenched rivals.
Halo had three products: the Band, the View, and the Rise. The Band was a basic fitness tracker that launched in 2020. It had some controversial features, such as measuring body fat with a 3D scan and analysing voice tone. The View was a smartwatch that came out in 2021. And the Rise was a sleep tracker and alarm clock that launched recently. The company announced that it would refund customers who bought a Halo device or accessory in the last year, stop charging for the Halo subscription, and delete all the data it had gathered.
Cortana on Windows

After years of gradually scaling back support, Microsoft discontinued the standalone Cortana app in August 2023, redirecting users to its new Bing Chatbot and AI Copilot features instead. Cortana’s shutdown marks the end of Microsoft’s attempt to compete with Siri and Google Assistant in the voice assistant space.
Originally launched in 2014, Cortana was designed to provide hands-free voice control and predictive information on Windows devices, similar to the capabilities of Apple and Google’s assistants. It expanded to Android, iOS, and Xbox over the next few years. However, Microsoft struggled to get consumers excited about Cortana. Usage remained niche compared to the competition. By 2021, Microsoft had already ended support for the iOS and Android apps, removed Cortana from the Windows taskbar and stripped out most third-party integrations. Its focus shifted to productivity features rather than general assistance.
ADVERTISEMENT
With new AI chatbots like Bing Chatbot and Copilot taking centre stage, Microsoft no longer saw a need for the standalone Cortana app. Its removal streamlines the Windows experience while freeing up resources for Microsoft’s new AI priorities. For now, the original Cortana lives on solely as an AI companion in Microsoft’s Halo videogame franchise.
Microsoft WordPad

The humble text editor WordPad is finally meeting its demise with Microsoft announcing it would no longer update the app and deprecate it with a future version of Windows. It was included for free on Windows PCs for over 25 years. While never as feature-rich as Word, the no-frills WordPad allowed users to compose documents, edit fonts and formats, and save files as .doc, .rtf or .txt. For students, office workers, and home users alike, WordPad struck a nice balance between capable and uncomplicated.
But with Word and Notepad improving over the years, Microsoft has decided WordPad’s time has passed. The app was already optional starting in 2020 before its looming removal from Windows was confirmed this September. Though it never had a large user base compared to Word, the soon-to-happen discontinuation of WordPad closes the book on an unassuming yet capable writing tool many grew up using. For those wanting more formatting options, Microsoft suggests its Office suite, while Notepad remains for basic text needs.
Omegle

The once-popular online chat platform Omegle announced in November that it would be shutting down operations after over a decade of connecting strangers for random conversations. Omegle founder Leif K-Brooks cited financial and psychological unsustainability as reasons for closing the anonymous chat site. Since its launch in 2009, Omegle had become a go-to destination for those seeking random connections online. However, the platform increasingly became a target for grooming and online abuse despite its original innocent intentions. Short-form video app TikTok even banned sharing Omegle links due to concerns over child safety on the platform.

While Omegle’s anonymous nature allowed for positive cultural exchanges and advice-seeking for some users, the lack of oversight made it difficult to control misuse. After years of fighting uphill battles, Omegle founder K-Brooks decided the platform could no longer bear the attacks and shut it down.
Hyperloop One

Hyperloop One, the ambitious transportation startup aiming to develop a network of tunnels for levitating pods travelling at speeds up to 760 mph, has ceased operations after nearly a decade of work. Despite raising over $400 million in funding and demonstrating a working prototype, the company was ultimately unable to secure any customers for its futuristic vision of transportation. After layoffs in 2022 and the withdrawal of investment from Sir Richard Branson, Hyperloop One was simply unable to sustain itself financially. The company’s assets, including its test track in Las Vegas, will be liquidated as its story comes to an end on December 31, 2023.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/tech-that-died-in-2023-9085069/,technology
iPhone design chief joins Sam Altman and Jony Ive to work on new AI device,Jony Ive and Sam Altman are working on a new AI hardware venture with the help of a former Apple executive. Will they create the next iPhone killer?,"What do you get when you combine the legendary designer of the iPhone, the visionary leader of OpenAI, and a former Apple executive with expertise in hardware engineering? A new AI hardware project that aims to create devices with cutting-edge capabilities, of course.
That’s the gist of the latest news from the tech world, where Apple executive Tang Tan reportedly is leaving the company to join Jony Ive and Sam Altman in working together on a new venture that involves the creation of new artificial intelligence hardware. The project is still in its early stages but has already attracted some of the best talent in the industry.
Ive, who left Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm LoveFrom, is no stranger to creating iconic products. He was the mastermind behind the iMac, the iPhone, the iPad, and many other devices that revolutionised the tech landscape under the guidance of Steve Jobs. Now, he hopes to do the same with AI hardware, and he has enlisted the help of Altman, who is the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, a research organisation that aims to create artificial general intelligence.
ADVERTISEMENT
Altman will provide the software foundation for the new AI devices, while Ive will oversee the design and aesthetics. The duo has also recruited Tang Tan, who is leaving his role as Apple’s vice president of iPhone and watch product design, to join LoveFrom and lead the hardware engineering for the project.
Tan’s departure is another blow for Apple, which has seen a wave of design talent leave the company since Ive’s exit. According to Bloomberg, about 14 members of Ive’s former team have left Apple since 2019, leaving only about half a dozen of the original designers who worked under Ive.
LoveFrom, on the other hand, has grown to more than 20 former Apple employees, and has also landed some prestigious clients, such as Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. LoveFrom’s consulting deal with Apple, which lasted for three years, ended in 2022.
The details of the new AI hardware project are still scarce, but sources say that the initial concepts include a set of devices for the home. The Information first reported that Ive and Altman were in talks over an AI device, and that Softbank’s Masayoshi Son was also involved in the discussions.
ADVERTISEMENT
Altman has made it clear that he is not interested in competing with the smartphone, which he considers to be the most popular device ever. He told The Wall Street Journal’s Tech Live event earlier this year that he had “no interest” in creating a device that would replace the iPhone. However, that has not stopped the speculation that the new AI hardware venture could pose a threat to Apple’s dominance in the consumer tech industry, especially given the hype around OpenAI’s ChatGPT.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/iphone-design-chief-leaves-apple-joins-altman-ive-ai-device-9086034/,technology

Jio working on ‘Bharat GPT’ with IIT-B; to launch OS for televisions: Akash Ambani,Ambani said artificial intelligence will be transforming every area of products and services.,"Reliance Jio Infocomm chairman Akash Ambani on Wednesday said the country’s largest telco is working with Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay to launch a ‘Bharat GPT’ programme.
The company, a unit of Reliance Industries, is also “comprehensively thinking” to launch an operating system for televisions, he said, adding that it has been working on it for a while now.
Speaking at the institute’s annual Techfest here, the 32-year-old Ambani family scion said building an “ecosystem of development” is very important for the company, and added that work on the vision of “Jio 2.0” is already on.

At present, we have just scratched the surface with large language models and generative AI and the next decade will be defined by these applications, he said.
Ambani said artificial intelligence will be transforming every area of products and services and added, “We are working very hard to launch AI not only as a vertical inside our organization, but also horizontally across all our sectors,” he said.
The company will be launching products and services in the media space, commerce, communication and also devices, he added.

“We have been working on our own OS (operating system) for a while now for the TVs and we are comprehensively thinking about how to launch it,” Ambani said.
Ambani said 2024 is a special year for the family, as his brother is set to get married in the year.
He also said that the company is very excited about offering 5G private networks, where it will offer a 5G stack to any enterprise irrespective of its size.
Ambani called India as the “biggest innovation centre” for the next decade, and exuded confidence that the country will be a USD 6 trillion economy by the end of the decade.

AI is going to “consume everything”, Ambani said, describing how his brother-in-law showed him an AI app to control the temperature of his mattress yesterday. “To me, yes AI stands for artificial intelligence, but it also stands for all included,” he said.
He said at Jio, the company works with a belief that what it is pursuing is good for India, and termed money as the “byproduct” of the service rendered to the country.
Calling Jio as the largest startup in the world, Ambani said there is a need for young entrepreneurs to not be fearful of failing.
Ambani also asked the entrepreneurs to work for societal good, especially if one is dabbling in the consumer space, and also asked everybody to be deeply passionate about the work they do.

Apple can temporarily sell smartwatches after US appeals court win,"Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023.","Apple can for now resume sales of its flagship smartwatches, after a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday paused a government commission’s import ban on the devices imposed in a patent dispute over its medical monitoring technology.
The tech giant had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt an order from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), which had ruled that Apple had infringed the patents of Irvine, California-based Masimo.
A final decision could cost either company millions of dollars and potentially force a settlement or some kind of technological workaround by Apple, analysts said. Ultimately, though, any financial hit for Apple is likely to be dwarfed by the bad publicity the lawsuit is generating, they said.

Masimo shares closed 4.6% lower at $115.11 following the decision on Wednesday, and Apple shares closed flat at $193.15.

“We are thrilled to return the full Apple Watch lineup to customers in time for the new year,” Apple said in a statement. “Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, including the blood oxygen feature, will become available for purchase again in the United States at Apple Stores starting today and from apple.com tomorrow by 12 pm PT.”
Masimo declined to comment on the court decision.
The ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Starting with its Series 6 model in 2020, Apple included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches.
Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches. Apple has countersued, calling Masimo’s legal actions a “maneuver to clear a path” for its own competing smartwatch.

“Apple can easily develop their own blood monitoring software, it is just a matter of time … The software development costs are not something that will be too concerning for a company as wealthy as Apple,” said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital.
“The bigger issue is that this is not very good PR for Apple, suggesting as it does that Apple is stealing technology from competitors rather than developing its own. Apple is fighting this lawsuit more with an eye on what it means for their future health-wearable products rather than this specific blood oxygen monitoring piece of software,” he said.
In a four-paragraph ruling on Wednesday, the appeals court said it would halt the ban while it considers Apple’s motion for a longer-term pause during the appeals process. The court gave the ITC until Jan. 10 to respond to Apple’s request.
U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration declined to veto the ban on Tuesday, allowing it to take effect. Apple asked for a pause of the ban later that day.
ADVERTISEMENT
Apple has said it is working on a range of legal and technical options.
On Tuesday, the company told the court that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is considering whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo’s patents and can be imported. The customs agency has set a target date of Jan. 12 for its decision, Apple said.
Apple had paused sales of the affected devices from its website and retail locations last week in the United States due to the ITC decision. They remained available at retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart.
The ban did not affect the Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model without a pulse oximeter. Previously sold watches also were not be affected by the ban.

Online platforms may be required to delete data of users inactive for 3 years,At least 25 rules have to be formulated to operationalise the Act notified in August and the government has also been empowered to enact rules for any provision that it deems fit.,"The Centre may require online platforms to permanently delete personal data of users who have been “completely away” from their accounts for at least three years in a row, The Indian Express has learnt.
According to the yet-to-be-released data protection rules, the government could impose the data deletion rules on e-commerce companies, online marketplaces, gaming intermediaries and all social media intermediaries, irrespective of the number of users they have in India, a senior government official said. The proposal is part of draft executive rules of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, which was ratified as a law in August this year.
At least 25 rules have to be formulated to operationalise the Act notified in August and the government has also been empowered to enact rules for any provision that it deems fit.

One of them is developing a consent framework to verify a child’s age before they can use an online service. The Act states that companies will need to gather “verifiable parental consent” for letting anyone under 18 years access their platform. This has been a major sticking point for the industry since the Act itself does not suggest ways in which platforms can perform age-gating.
The rules, it is learnt, are expected to recommend two methods. One is to use a digital locker system backed by a government ID like Aadhaar, this paper had earlier reported. The other is for the industry to create an electronic token system which will be allowed only if the government authorises it. Some entities can be exempted from obtaining verifiable parental consent and age gating requirements including healthcare and educational institutions.
It is also understood some entities can be exempted from the norms on a restricted basis, that is, depending on the specific purpose for which they need to process a child’s data.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/online-platforms-may-be-required-to-delete-data-of-users-inactive-for-3-years-9085540/,technology
Apple wins bid to pause Apple Watch ban at US appeals court,The tech giant had filed an emergency request for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the order after appealing the US International Trade Commission's (ITC) decision that it had infringed Masimo's patents.,"Apple scored a victory on Wednesday as a U.S. appeals court paused a government commission’s import ban on some of its popular Apple smartwatches following a patent dispute with medical-technology firm Masimo.
The tech giant had filed an emergency request for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the order after appealing the U.S. International Trade Commission’s (ITC) decision that it had infringed Masimo’s patents.
Representatives for Apple and Masimo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration declined to veto the ban on Dec. 26, allowing it to take effect. Apple asked for a pause of the ban later that day.
Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches.
The ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.
Apple has paused sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the U.S., though the watches have remained available at other retailers including Amazon, Best Buy , Costco and Walmart.

"New York Times sues OpenAI, Microsoft over use of its stories to train chatbots",The lawsuit also follows what appears to be breakdowns in talks between the newspaper and the two companies.,"The New York Times has filed a federal lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, seeking to end the practice of using its stories to train chatbots. In the suit filed Wednesday in the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, the Times said OpenAI and Microsoft are advancing their technology through the “unlawful use of The Times’s work to create artificial intelligence products that compete with it” and “threatens The Times’s ability to provide that service.” OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Media organizations have been pummeled by a migration of readers to online platforms and while many publications have carved out a digital space online as well, artificial intelligence technology has threatened to upend numerous industries, including media. Artificial intelligence companies scrape information available online, including articles published by media organizations, to train generative AI chatbots. Those companies have attracted billions in investments very rapidly. The Times did not list specific damages that it is seeking, but said the legal action “seeks to hold them responsible for the billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages that they owe for the unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.”In the complaint, the Times said Microsoft and OpenAI “seek to free-tide on The Times’s massive investments in its journalism” by using it to build products without payment or permission.
In July, OpenAI and The Associated Press announced a deal for the artificial intelligence company to license AP’s archive of news stories.

However, The New York Times said it’s never given permission to anyone to use its content for generative AI purposes.
The lawsuit also follows what appears to be breakdowns in talks between the newspaper and the two companies.
The Times said it reached out to Microsoft and OpenAI in April to raise concerns about the use of its intellectual property and reach a resolution on the issue. During the talks, the newspaper said it sought to “ensure it received fair value” for the use of its content, “facilitate the continuation of a healthy news ecosystem, and help develop GenAI technology in a responsible way that benefits society and supports a well-informed public.”
“These negotiations have not led to a resolution,” the lawsuit said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/new-york-times-sues-openai-microsoft-use-stories-train-chatbots-9085354/,technology

OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla believes AI will cause economic deflation in the next 25 years,"AI will cause deflation and abundance in 25 years, says OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla.","Indian American businessman Vinod Khosla who has invested in OpenAI believes that AI will fundamentally change the global economy. The 68-year-old took to his X account to share his thoughts on the rapid rise of AI. Khosla while retweeting Erik Brynjofsson, the director at Stanford Digital Economy Lab, said that AI should be deflationary in the next 25 years.
Interestingly, Brynjofsson was responding to a tweet by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on capitalists and the relationship between interest rates and new ideas.
“AI should be hugely deflationary over twenty five years. Capital should be scarce for a while, current measures of GDP and the economy will be less relevant but goods and services should be in great abundance. The key question is what are the right measures and the right questions,” Khosla wrote in his tweet.

Khosla’s viewpoint is in contrast to the conditions of the market and economy for the past two years. It needs to be noted that although inflation remains an issue, the rate of price increases has reduced from its highest levels in many years. During a deflationary environment, prices fall resulting in low profits for companies and dismal economic growth.
According to Khosla, capital should be limited for some time, and traditional indicators of GDP and economic health may become less pertinent. He added that there should be a plentiful supply of goods and services.
Khosla who is an alumnus of IIT Delhi, is a venture capitalist who was ranked 92nd on the Forbes 400 list in 2021. He is the founder of Khosla Ventures and the co-founder of Sun Microsystems. The entrepreneur has also stated in the past that machine learning will replace many jobs and increase income disparities but also generate enough GDP to offer basic income for everyone.

Humanoid robots in space: the next frontier,NASA Dexterous Robotics Team Leader Shaun Azimi said humanoid robots in space could potentially handle risky tasks like cleaning solar panels.,"Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (188 centimeters) tall and weighing 300 pounds (136 kilograms), NASA’s humanoid robot Valkyrie is an imposing figure.
Valkyrie, named after a female figure in Norse mythology and being tested at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, is designed to operate in “degraded or damaged human-engineered environments,” like areas hit by natural disasters, according to NASA.
A humanoid robot resembles a person, typically with a torso, head, two arms and two legs. Engineers believe with the right software, humanoid robots will eventually be able to function similarly to humans and use the same tools and equipment.

NASA Dexterous Robotics Team Leader Shaun Azimi said humanoid robots in space could potentially handle risky tasks like cleaning solar panels or inspecting malfunctioning equipment outside the spacecraft so astronauts can prioritize exploration and discovery.
“We’re not trying to replace human crews, we’re really just trying to take the dull, dirty and dangerous work off their plates to allow them to focus on those higher-level activities,” Azimi said.
NASA is partnering with robotics companies like Austin, Texas-based Apptronik to learn how humanoid robots developed for terrestrial purposes could benefit future humanoid robots destined for space.
Apptronik is developing Apollo, a humanoid robot whose earthly tasks will include working in warehouses and manufacturing plants by moving packages, stacking pallets and other supply chain-oriented tasks.

Researchers develop ‘electronic soil’ to enhance crop growth,Researchers have developed a new electronics soil that was found to increase the growth of barley seedlings by 50 per cent in a new study.,"A newly developed eSoil that stimulated root systems helped barley seedlings grow an average of 50 per cent more in a new study. The low-power bioelectronic scaffolding can be used for soilless cultivation methods like hydroponics.
Eleni Stavrinidou, an associate professor at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics at Linköping University is the leader of the Electronic Plants group that developed the electrically conductive cultivation substrate tailed for hydroponic cultivation that they are calling eSoil.
Hydroponics refers to the technique of growing plants without soil using a water-based nutrient solution, an aggregate substrate, or growing media like coconut coir or perlite. It uses closed systems that recirculate water to make sure each seedling gets exactly the nutrients it needs. This means that very little water is needed and that all nutrients remain within the system.

Hydroponic systems often use mineral wool as a cultivation substrate in hydroponics. But these wools are often non-biodegradable and are produced using energy-intensive processes. eSoil is made of cellulose, a biopolymer mixed with a conductive polymer called PEDOT. This combination is not new but it is the first time it has been used for plant cultivation, according to Linköping University.
Previous research has already used high voltage to stimulate the roots but the advantage of eSoil is that it has very low energy consumption and not high-voltage danger. The study showed that barley seedlings can be cultivated using hydroponics and that they have a better growth rate due to electrical stimulation.
“The world population is increasing, and we also have climate change. So it’s clear that we won’t be able to cover the food demands of the planet with only the already existing agricultural methods. But with hydroponics, we can grow food also in urban environments in very controlled settings,” said Stavrinidou in a press statement.
According to Stavrinidou, eSoil can be used to grow seedlings faster with fewer resources. “We don’t yet know how it actually works, which biological mechanisms that are involved. What we have found is that seedlings process nitrogen more effectively, but it’s not clear yet how the electrical stimulation impacts this process,” she added.

While the researchers do not propose that eSoil can address the problem of food security, they assert that it can help in areas with little arable land and harsh environmental conditions.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/esoil-plant-growth-electronic-soil-9084927/,technology

Copilot vs ChatGPT: Which free AI chatbot app should you use?,Should you replace the ChatGPT app on your phone with Microsoft’s new Copilot app? Let’s find out.,"Microsoft was quick on the draw to enter the AI chatbot race, launching Bing Chat back in February in hopes of driving some growth for their underdog search engine. Unfortunately, their strategy didn’t seem to move the needle, with Bing’s growth mostly staying flat throughout the year. Now it looks like the Redmond giant is trying something new.
Bing Chat got a rebrand to Copilot and has been integrated into a bunch of Microsoft products including Edge and Windows 11. But mobile was an afterthought, with no direct way to access Copilot – you had to download Edge or the Bing app. As a frequent Copilot user (it’s basically free GPT-4!), I always thought it would be really slick to have a dedicated app so I don’t have to launch Edge every time. Well ask and ye shall receive – the Copilot app is finally here on Android.

Apple files appeal after Biden administration allows US ban on watch imports,The U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) order bars imports and sales of Apple Watches that use technology for reading blood-oxygen levels.,"Apple on Tuesday appealed a decision to ban imports of its watches based on a complaint from medical monitoring technology company Masimo, after U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration declined to veto a government tribunal.
The tech giant also filed an emergency request on Tuesday for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban.
It asked the Federal Circuit to pause the ban at least until U.S. Customs and Border Protection decides whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo’s patents, and to put the ban on hold while the court considers Apple’s request. The customs office is due to make its decision on Jan. 12, Apple said.

Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.

The U.S. International Trade Commission’s (ITC) order bars imports and sales of Apple Watches that use technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included the pulse oximeter feature in its smart watches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ban following careful consultations, and the ITC’s decision became final on Dec. 26, the Trade Representative’s office said on Tuesday.
An Apple spokesperson said the company has appealed the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.

“We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible,” Apple said in a statement on Tuesday.
The ITC last week rejected Apple’s request to pause the ban during the appeal process and opposed Apple’s request for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban in a court filing on Tuesday.
A Masimo spokesperson called the ITC decision “a win for the integrity of the U.S. patent system, and ultimately American consumers.”
While companies usually settle such disputes, Apple may think it can design around the patents quickly or remove the infringing feature, said Nicholas Matich, an intellectual property attorney with law firm McKool Smith.

“There’s nothing legally extraordinary about the ITC issuing an exclusion order,” Matich said. “What’s extraordinary here is that the product at issue is high profile and that Apple has chosen to live with the ITC order rather than settle.”
Stifel analysts said in a note that their litigation expert predicted a potential Apple appeal would extend the “final” ITC case verdict roughly another year.
Apple has paused its sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States since last week, though the watches remain available from other retailers including Amazon , Best Buy and Walmart as of Tuesday.
The ban does not affect Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model, which will continue to be sold. Previously sold watches will not be affected by the ban.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ban following careful consultations, and the ITC’s decision became final on Dec. 26, the agency said in its decision.

Apple can, however, appeal the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
The company has paused the sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States since last week. The ban does not affect Apple Watch SE, a less expensive model, which will continue to be sold. Previously sold watches will not be affected by the ban.
Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.
A jury trial on Masimo’s allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware and has called Masimo’s legal actions a “maneuver to clear a path” for its own competing smart watch.

A presidential administration has not vetoed an ITC ruling since 2013, when President Barack Obama’s administration overturned an import ban on Apple’s iPhones and iPads in the company’s patent dispute with Samsung.
The Biden administration in February chose not to veto a separate import ban on Apple Watches based on a patent-infringement complaint from medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC has placed the ban on hold for other reasons.

Scientists simulate asteroid defence using nukes,Scientists are simulating what the impact of nuclear devices on asteroids would be to evaluate their effectiveness as a defence system against asteroids.,"After NASA’s successful test of an asteroid defence technique with its DART mission, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed a modelling tool to assess the potential use of a nuclear defence to defend Earth against catastrophic asteroid impacts.
The study published in the Planetary Science Journal this month introduces a new approach to simulate a nuclear device depositing energy on an asteroid’s surface. The tool was developed to help improve our understanding of nuclear deflection’s radiation interactions on the asteroid’s surface while opening the door to new research on the shockwave dynamic affecting the inner asteroid.

2023 was Apple’s toughest year in recent memory; here’s why,"From China bans to EU antitrust charges, 2023 was a remarkably difficult year for Apple across numerous fronts. A recap of the tech giant's biggest setbacks.","As the year comes to an end, Apple is facing one of the biggest setbacks in years – a ban on the latest Apple Watches in the company’s home turf. It was an unprecedented move when a company as big as Apple had to temporarily halt sales of its latest Apple Watches due to a patent dispute. Surely, that’ll only be a tiny blip on their radar? Not quite. This bit of bad news is actually part of a larger trend of misfortunes for Apple in 2023. From revenue decline to regulatory pressure, we take a look back at how the past year has proven to be a not-so-good year for Apple.
Disastrous year in China
Apple has experienced a catastrophic 2023 in China – a massive blow considering the country accounts for nearly 20% of the tech giant’s revenue, second only to the US. After enjoying market dominance for years, Apple has faced intense competition from homegrown phone makers like Xiaomi and Oppo. But the biggest threat has come from the resurgence of Huawei, despite US sanctions. In fact, Huawei overtook Apple’s iPhone for the no.1 spot in smartphone market share this year, according to the research firm Canalys. Industry experts predict that the iPhone will fall behind Huawei in 2024, which is an alarming trend given that the iPhone 15 brought major upgrades.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-tough-year-2023-watch-ban-tim-cook-ipad-9083377/,technology
"2023’s best mid-range smartphones: Realme 11 Pro Plus, Nothing Phone (2), and more","The mid-range smartphone segment is all about offering flagship features like telephoto camera, processor and build quality at a fraction of the price. From lower to upper mid-range, here are our top picks of 2023.","The mid-range smartphone segment is in a strange place right now, trying to strike a balance between features and price. While the lower mid-range segment often misses out on software updates, premium mid-range devices try to offer flagship features and build quality at a much lower price.
With several Indian smartphone buyers gradually shifting from budget to the mid-range segment, the stakes for phone manufacturers have been higher than before. In 2023, phone makers like Nothing, Realme, and Motorola upped the ante and made a name for themselves in the mid-range segment, offering flagship features at a fraction of the price. Here are the best mid-range smartphones that grabbed our attention in 2023.

Japan’s SLIM ‘moon sniper’ reaches lunar orbit ahead of landmark landing,Japan will attempt to become just the fifth country in the world to soft-land a spacecraft on the Moon.,"The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on Tuesday announced that its “Smart Lander for Investigating Moon” or SLIM lander successfully went into lunar orbit at 1.21 PM IST. If it succeeds, it will land Japan in the exclusive list of countries that can soft land a probe on the Moon. The same club that India joined when Chandrayaan-3 landed this year.
SLIM was inserted into an elliptical lunar orbit connecting the Moon’s south and north poles with a period of about 6.4 hours. Its altitude will be about 600 kilometres at the point closest to the Moon (perilune) and 4,000 kilometres at the point furthest away from the Moon (apolune). From now until mid-January 2024, the Japanese space agency will lower the apolune point. The perilune point will also be lowered to an altitude of 15 kilometres on January 19. The lander will start descending towards the Moon on January 20.

Noise Pure Pods review: Take the music out of your ears,Noise Pure Pods introduces the concept of open wireless stereo to the Indian market with AirWave Technology.,"There are some people who feel uncomfortable with in-ear earphones and prefer on-the-year headphones that don’t make you uncomfortable by being too close for comfort. The Noise Pure Pods are intended for those who like the comfort of passive audio, something that doesn’t feel like it is literally inside your head. The Noise Pure Pods introduces the concept of open wireless stereo to the Indian market, but does it really make a difference to users?
The Noise Pure Pods have an interesting design — it comes with a loop that goes around your ear lobes and places the stereo pods in front of your ear canal. The stereo uses AirWave Technology which uses air conduction via its 16mm Neodymium Dynamic Drivers to make you hear the music — and I thought all speakers used air conduction in a way. But in simple terms, these are like small speakers in front of each ear and don’t touch your skull like in bone conduction headphones. The loop is comfortable for long-term use. If you are up to something more active, the fins can be replaced by a neckband that connects both the pods.

5 lows from the world of tech in 2023,"These controversies dominated the tech world in 2023, be it the firing and rehiring of OpenAI’s Sam Altman to the downfall of X (formerly Twitter).","There were highs, lows, and, well, a lot of drama in the tech world in 2023. Although companies like Apple and Microsoft have seen sky-high valuations, big tech was in the spotlight for a lot of wrong reasons. While regulatory clamped down on big tech companies over the abuse of market dominance continued, some used mass layoffs after being pressured by investors to scale down.
Below are five lows from the tech sector in 2023:
Economic uncertainty and over hiring during the pandemic boom, are among the most commonly cited reasons companies laid off their employees. (Image Source: FreePik)
Spate of tech layoffs: It seemed as if years of easy money and rock-bottom rates would never end, but there was a reversal in fortunes, and reality hit hard. The tech layoffs that accelerated through the second half of 2022 continued in 2023, with almost 240,000 jobs eliminated through the year as companies as large as Google, Amazon and Microsoft as well as smaller startups eliminated thousands of jobs. Many of them were forced to downsize staff, citing significant investments made in certain divisions with no clear path to recoup those long-term bets. Others were shown the door after companies were pressured to become as lean as possible following investor cutbacks. Even though layoffs continued in Silicon Valley, tech companies didn’t lose the opportunity to scoop up talent, especially in chip development, machine learning and AI. In fact, a data scientist is the most in-demand job on the market right now. More so, searches for generative AI jobs on job-hunting platforms like Indeed have increased by 4000%.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s exit and return: There was a moment of disbelief when Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, was abruptly fired by the board of directors of Silicon Valley’s hottest startup. The announcement of Altman’s departure was so hush-hush that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said his company, OpenAI’s biggest investor, had not been contacted before the big reveal. The next few days before Altman was reinstated as CEO had more twists than any prime-time TV soap opera. At one point, Altman even joined Microsoft to lead the company’s new advanced artificial intelligence division, though that didn’t last long either. But once Altman was brought back to OpenAI, most of the old board members who had fired him were out. The firing and rehiring of Altman, perhaps the most important person in tech at the moment, showcases the power dynamics and how egos are at play. His ouster from OpenAI and support for his restoration gave the Silicon Valley wunderkind, who is in his 30s, a new level of fame, instantly making him a household name. Even though Altman has been presented as the future of tech, at least in his public persona, his company has surely started the debate on how artificial intelligence could rule our lives – negatively and positively.

The downfall of X (formerly Twitter): Over the past year, since billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, the social media platform has experienced a significant decline. Despite adopting a new marketing name, “X,” and appointing a new CEO, Twitter has faced challenges such as frequent outages, significant staff layoffs, a proliferation of fake news, confusing subscription services and substantial losses in advertising revenue, even as it reinstated accounts belonging to Alex Jones and Donald Trump. Meanwhile, competitors have rolled out rival platforms (or Twitter clones) such as Threads and Bluesky in the hope of capturing users still actively seeking to “microblog” on pertinent issues. The truth is, Musk’s plan to bring Twitter back to its old glory hasn’t panned out; rather, it has gone downhill. Under Linda Yaccarino, the former advertising chief for NBCUniversal, Twitter has only become more chaotic. Drastic policy changes, the way Twitter handled disinformation about the violence in Israel-Palestine, and the platform’s business model are all contributing to the demise of this once-popular social network.

Slow growth of 5G: Years after glitzy campaigns with promises to revolutionise the telecom industry, 5G has been a major flop. As the year closed, experts and trade insiders started to open up about how 5G has not had as big an impact as many telecom operators and gear makers were hoping for. In fact, the “real” impact of 5G compared to its predecessors has been far less. 5G, from the very beginning, was hyped to bring in high-speed download speeds and lag-free gaming, but 4G was good enough for most people. However, in reality, most of the current use cases of 5G are less relevant to consumers and more aimed at the enterprise. You might already own a 5G phone, but nobody knows how it’s better than your previous phone. Does it significantly change the experience? Probably not. Video calls are still the same, and so are watching YouTube videos. The problem is how telecom companies promised use cases of 5G, such as cloud-streaming gaming, self-driving cars, and AR/MR headsets way before their mass adoption. And yet, all the marketing campaigns to promote 5G and its rollout have so far proven lukewarm. The low uptake of 5G and lack of monetization opportunities led to a blip in the 5G hype, and eventually a massive disappointment.

Apple-Masimo patent case: A patent infringement case has led to Apple pulling out two of the newest Apple Watch models, the Series 9 and Ultra 2, from retail shelves in the US. Its online store paused sales on December 21, and the watches were removed from Apple’s physical stores on December 24. The unprecedented move by Apple follows a ruling by the International Trade Commission in October that found several Apple Watches infringe on patents held by Masimo, a medical technology company in Irvine, California. This means Apple can no longer import and sell its newest Apple Watch models in the US — at least temporarily. Apple has won many legal battles with smaller companies in the past, but this time around, Cupertino actually lost a patent case over the technology its smartwatches use to detect people’s pulse rate. To avoid a complete ban, Apple can cut a deal with Masimo to license its technology, or it could appeal to the Biden administration to reverse the ruling. Still, one wonders how a company as big and powerful as Apple reached this point. This case could have both financial and reputational blows to Apple, which has tried to stay away from controversies. In court, Masimo detailed how Apple poached its top executives, stole trade secrets, and infringed on Masimo’s patents before later releasing a watch with a pulse oximeter. Poaching of talent in big tech is a known secret (also a dark reality), but the Masimo-Apple patent case also reignites the debate on how smaller companies are at the forefront of innovating new technologies, sometimes being bought by bigger rivals or not ending up getting acknowledgement for inventing game-changing technologies.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/5-lows-from-the-world-of-tech-in-2023-9082134/,technology

Chipmaker Nvidia raises $15 mln for non-profits helping Israel-Hamas war-hit civilians,"Thousands of employees from more than 30 countries donated a total of $5 million, which the company matched and doubled to $10 million under a special program introduced to help those affected by the war, Nvidia said on Sunday.","U.S. chipmaker Nvidia and its employees have donated $15 million to Israeli and foreign non-profit organisations that are supporting civilians affected by Israel’s war with Palestinian militant group Hamas.
Thousands of employees from more than 30 countries donated a total of $5 million, which the company matched and doubled to $10 million under a special program introduced to help those affected by the war, Nvidia said on Sunday.
It noted that the donation was the largest humanitarian fundraiser in the company’s 30-year-old history.

“We are proud to see such broad support from Nvidia families in Israel and around the world, and are grateful for their prayers and hope for the return of our colleague Avinatan Or, and the other hostages from Hamas captivity,” said Gideon Rosenberg, Nvidia’s deputy general counsel.
“We are truly inspired by the genuine care of our employees around the world.”
Or, 30, has been an engineer at Nvidia since April 2022, according to his LinkedIn page. He was captured by Hamas at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7 along with his girlfriend Noa Argamani and around 240 others, some of whom have since been released.
Nvidia said employees had chosen to donate to organisations in the region including Asor Fund (JGive), American Friends of Magen David Adom, Doctors Without Borders, Friends of United Hatzalah, IsraAID (US) Global Humanitarian Assistance, Jewish Agency for Israel, World Central Kitchen and Zaka.

Beware: New WhatsApp scam can drain your bank accounts and lock you out of social media,"WhatsApp screen share scams are on the rise, and here is how you can protect yourself from the new age cybercrime.","WhatsApp has become the centrepiece of our digital life. From staying connected with friends and family to making payments, it is undoubtedly a useful app to have. However, miscreants are now taking advantage of the wider WhatsApp audience to embark on financial fraud activities, and one such recent development is the WhatsApp screen share scam.
Digital scams usually involve victims sharing the OTP, also known as a one-time password, with scammers, which will then be used to take control of various online services for money transfers. With WhatsApp screen share scams, the victim does not have to do anything other than enable the screen share option, as requested by cybercriminals.

Under a thousand: Wireless charging made super convenient,"Ambrane PowerPod seems pretty much your standard ""phone stand wireless charger."" It is an inclined stand on which you can rest your phone and also keep using it while it charges.","It has been around for a while, but wireless charging remains a bit of an iffy proposition. While the number of devices supporting wireless charging has gone up, the process of doing so gets a little troublesome. You need a wireless charging pad, which often costs much more than a conventional wired charger, and often have to compromise on charging speed if on a tight budget. That’s not all. Some charging pads require you to lay your device flat on them, which makes using them while charging a bit of a challenge as the slightest movement can disconnect them. Then there are those that are designed like phone stands but can only be used while charging in portrait mode as the charging area is bang in the centre and cannot be reached when the phone is kept in landscape mode, which is best for watching a match or most video content.
The Ambrane PowerPod manages to address a number of these issues. And at Rs 999 too (which is why it is in this column).

Buying Rs 100 AirPods? Here’s why you should steer clear of these fakes,"Buying fake AirPods is risky on many levels, here is why you should stay away from them.","It’s quite common to find cheap AirPod knockoffs in 2023, some priced as low as Rs 100 a pair. From roadside vendors to online e-commerce websites, there’s no shortage of these fake AirPods. Initially intriguing, the consequences of owning a fake electronic accessory that goes inside your ear are more concerning than you could imagine.
It’s hard to distinguish
Even if you have an eye for detail, it’s challenging to distinguish between some of the fake, also known as first-copy AirPods, and the real deal. Some fake AirPods even mimic the seamless setup process when paired with an iPhone. When you cross-check the serial number, they might appear genuine.

"New ‘doom calculator’ AI predicts death, but do we really want to know?",Denmark researchers develop eerie AI that can predict your death.,"Imagine an artificial intelligence that could predict when you will die just by looking at key details of your life. This ‘doom calculator’ is now a reality thanks to new AI research. But is this technology a pandora’s box we should avoid opening?
Researchers in Denmark and the US have created an AI system called life2vec that can predict if someone will die within four years with over 75% accuracy. The AI crunched data on age, health, jobs, income and other factors for over 6 million Danes. According to the research paper, it was fed sentences about life events, like “In September 2012, Francisco received 20,000 Danish kroner as a guard at a castle in Elsinore.”

HP Pavilion Plus 16 review: The perfect symphony of design and performance,Slim 16-inch stunner from HP packs a punch with 13th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU and GeForce RTX 3050 graphics. But is it worth the price?,"Most laptops that are meant for productivity are great at handling office work and impressing your coworkers in a meeting. But when it comes to gaming, they give up without a fight. There’s a clear gap between regular laptops and gaming laptops. You have two choices: a gaming laptop with all the bells and whistles, or a sleek laptop that struggles with games from 10 years ago – there’s no middle ground.
But the HP Pavilion Plus 16 (ab0456TX) is a different beast altogether. It looks like a serious laptop for professionals with its subtle colour and refined design, but under the hood, it has a powerful CPU and GPU combo that can run some of the hottest AAA games at a decent frame rate. I’ve been testing it for a week and here’s what I think.

2023 in spaceflight: Chandrayaan-3 and other missions that defined space exploration this year,"Space missions reach new heights in 2023 as India sticks lunar landing, NASA studies asteroids, and SpaceX iterates at warp speed. The final frontier continues to inspire.","When Chandrayaan 3 made a soft landing on the Moon this year, it underlined a hard truth — India is right up there on the list of the biggest spacefaring superpowers in the world along with the United States, China, and Russia. While the Indian Space Research Organisation’s grand success with the mission is quite monumental, that was not the only space exploration mission that pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible.
Despite all of the impressive feats that were conducted this year, it did not quite live up to what happened in 2022. During that year, NASA launched the Artemis 1 Moon mission, marking the first step in humanity’s return to the Moon. Before that, we got the first images from the pathbreaking James Webb Space Telescope. China also made waves with the completion of its first space station.

GTA VI hacker sentenced to life in hospital prison,A hacker who leaked 90 videos of the upcoming GTA VI game has been ordered to stay in a high-security hospital indefinitely.,"The 18-year-old hacker who played a key role in leaking footage of the highly anticipated video game Grand Theft Auto VI has been sentenced to indefinitely remain in a high-security British hospital prison, according to a report from the BBC on Thursday.
The judge determined that Kurtaj, who has autism, poses a danger to the public due to his intent to continue carrying out cybercrimes if released. During the sentencing hearing, the court heard the hacker had been violent while in custody, with many reports of injuries and property damage. A mental health evaluation also concluded he still expressed a desire to engage in further hacking activities as soon as possible. As a result, he received an indefinite hospital order, meaning he must stay in the secure hospital facility unless doctors decide he no longer poses a threat.

"Apple’s groundbreaking AI research could transform iPhones, leap ahead of Google and Microsoft","Through its recent research papers on AI, Apple seems to be planning to be at the forefront of AI in smartphones.","Artificial Intelligence has been the buzzword of 2023 with Google, Meta, and Microsoft showcasing their line of products and their grand vision to harness AI. In all the pandemonium surrounding AI, Apple has been conspicuously silent or slow when it comes to showcasing its AI prowess. Perhaps, this is the reason why many have been asking what Apple is doing to keep up with the AI arms race. The answer is simple, Apple has been working with AI in different capacities for years. It is only that users have not been able to integrate something like ChatGPT on their iPhones. 
However, things are about to change. Apple in a new research paper has demonstrated a breakthrough technique that can help in running AI on iPhones. This technique involves streamlining bulky LLMs using flash storage optimisation. When Apple integrates advanced AI into the iPhone, it will be another significant turn of events. The Cupertino-based tech giant has announced significant developments in AI through two new research papers that it showcased this month.

Sonodyne Malhar review: An Indian masterpiece that serves pure sound for the purists,This vintage-inspired speaker from Sonodyne Audio has a nostalgic vibe.,"Over time, it seems most of us have lost the context of pure sound. What we are used to these days via our headphones, televisions, and Bluetooth speakers is a cacophony of amped-up bass and synthetic sounds. Yes, audio has to be a very personal choice, but it has to be a choice where a user decides this is exactly how they want to listen to their music. Every once in a while an audio device comes along trying to underline the beauty of pure sound which is more natural and live. The Sonodyne Malhar is clearly in that range of products.
Made by Kolkata-based Sonodyne, the Malhar stands out the moment you pull it out of the box. This one comes with a heavy 8-kg wooden cabinet that has a beatbox-like look about it and clearly suggests it means business. There is also an air of simplicity that brings with it a hint of nostalgia for those like me who have been around for a while now. Malhar has two front-facing drivers and tweeters flanked by two side-facing radiators on the sides, together promising a wide soundstage with high fidelity.

Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 could send 240 mln PCs to landfills – report,Microsoft aims to discontinue support for Windows 10 by October 2025.,"Microsoft Corp’s plan to end support for Windows 10 operating system could result in about 240 million personal computers (PCs) being disposed, potentially adding to landfill waste, Canalys Research said.
The electronic waste from these PCs could weigh an estimated 480 million kilograms, equivalent to 320,000 cars.
While many PCs could remain functional for years post the end of OS support, Canalys warned demand for devices without security updates could be low.

Microsoft announced a plan to provide security updates for Windows 10 devices until October 2028 for an undisclosed annual price.
If the pricing structure for extended Windows 10 support mirrors past trends, migrating to newer PCs could be more cost-effective, increasing the number of older PCs heading to scrap, Canalys said.
Microsoft aims to discontinue support for Windows 10 by October 2025. The next generation of the OS, anticipated to bring advanced artificial intelligence technology to PCs, could potentially boost the sluggish PC market.

Apple Watch patent case deepens as ITC denies plea to stay import ban,The doomsday clock for Apple Watch is ticking as the US ITC denied plea to stay import ban on Wednesday.,"Apple is quickly running out of time as the doomsday for the latest Apple Watch lineup approaches. Wednesday saw another major setback as the US International Trade Commission (ITC) denied the company’s request to delay a ban on imports and sales of the two devices, which was handed down in an October ruling stating that Apple infringed on patents held by medical device company Masimo related to SpO2 sensors for measuring blood oxygen levels.
As a result, Apple announced earlier this week that it will pull the Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 off all store shelves in the US by December 24, with the import ban going into effect December 26. This applies only to Apple’s own retail stores – third-party retailers like Best Buy will still be able to sell any remaining inventory after that date.

"AI cannot be patent ‘inventor’, UK Supreme Court rules in landmark case","Stephen Thaler wanted to be granted two patents in the UK for inventions he says were devised by his ""creativity machine"" called DABUS.","A U.S. computer scientist on Wednesday lost his bid to register patents over inventions created by his artificial intelligence system in a landmark case in Britain about whether AI can own patent rights.
Stephen Thaler wanted to be granted two patents in the UK for inventions he says were devised by his “creativity machine” called DABUS.
His attempt to register the patents was refused by the UK’s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) on the grounds that the inventor must be a human or a company, rather than a machine.
ADVERTISEMENT
Thaler appealed to the UK’s Supreme Court, which on Wednesday unanimously rejected his appeal as under UK patent law “an inventor must be a natural person”.
Judge David Kitchin said in the court’s written ruling that the case was “not concerned with the broader question whether technical advances generated by machines acting autonomously and powered by AI should be patentable”.
Thaler’s lawyers said in a statement that the ruling “establishes that UK patent law is currently wholly unsuitable for protecting inventions generated autonomously by AI machines and as a consequence wholly inadequate in supporting any industry that relies on AI in the development of new technologies”.
‘LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS’
A spokesperson for the IPO welcomed the decision “and the clarification it gives as to the law as it stands in relation to the patenting of creations of artificial intelligence machines”.
ADVERTISEMENT
They added that there are “legitimate questions as to how the patent system and indeed intellectual property more broadly should handle such creations” and the government will keep this area of law under review.
Thaler earlier this year lost a similar bid in the United States, where the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s refusal to issue patents for inventions created by his AI system.
Giles Parsons, a partner at law firm Browne Jacobson, who was not involved in the case, said the UK Supreme Court’s ruling was unsurprising.
“This decision will not, at the moment, have a significant effect on the patent system,” he said. “That’s because, for the time being, AI is a tool, not an agent.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I do expect that will change in the medium term, but we can deal with that problem as it arises.”
Rajvinder Jagdev, an intellectual property partner at Powell Gilbert, said the ruling followed similar decisions by courts in Europe, Australia and the U.S. and has “given certainty that inventors must be a natural person.”
But he added: “The judgment does not preclude a person using an AI to devise an invention – in such a scenario, it would be possible to apply for a patent provided that person is identified as the inventor.”
In a separate case last month, London’s High Court ruled that artificial neural networks can attract patent protection under UK law.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-cannot-be-patent-inventor-uk-supreme-court-rules-in-landmark-case-9076959/,technology
"Pulitzer-winning authors join OpenAI, Microsoft copyright lawsuit",Sancton's was the first author lawsuit against OpenAI to also name Microsoft as a defendant. The tech giant has invested billions of dollars in the artificial intelligence startup and integrated OpenAI's systems into its products.,"A group of 11 nonfiction authors have joined a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court that accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of misusing books the authors have written to train the models behind OpenAI’s popular chatbot ChatGPT and other artificial-intelligence based software.
The writers, including Pulitzer Prize winners Taylor Branch, Stacy Schiff and Kai Bird – who co-wrote the J. Robert Oppenheimer biography “American Prometheus” that was adapted into the hit film “Oppenheimer” this year – told the court on Tuesday that the companies infringed their copyrights by using their work to train OpenAI’s GPT large language models.
Representatives for OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

“The defendants are raking in billions from their unauthorized use of nonfiction books, and the authors of these books deserve fair compensation and treatment for it,” the writers’ attorney Rohit Nath said on Wednesday.
Writer and Hollywood Reporter editor Julian Sancton first filed the proposed class-action lawsuit last month. The case is one of several that have been brought by groups of copyright owners including authors John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jonathan Franzen against OpenAI and other tech companies over the alleged misuse of their work in AI training.
The companies have denied the allegations.
Sancton’s was the first author lawsuit against OpenAI to also name Microsoft as a defendant. The tech giant has invested billions of dollars in the artificial intelligence startup and integrated OpenAI’s systems into its products.
The amended complaint filed on Monday said that OpenAI “scraped” the authors’ works along with reams of other copyrighted material from the internet without permission to teach its GPT models how to respond to human text prompts.
ADVERTISEMENT
The lawsuit also said that Microsoft has been “deeply involved” in training and developing the models and is also liable for copyright infringement.
The authors asked the court for an unspecified amount of monetary damages and an order for the companies to stop infringing their copyrights.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/pulitzer-winning-authors-join-openai-microsoft-copyright-lawsuit-9076954/,technology

Sony highlights PS5 momentum as hardware sales top 50 million,"The entertainment conglomerate is looking for a strong performance from the PS5, which is in its fourth year on the market, during the holiday shopping season to hit its sales target of a record 25 million units in the current financial year ending March 31.","Sony is seeing strong momentum for its PlayStation 5 console, a senior games executive said, with lifetime sales exceeding 50 million units and the company recording its best-ever Black Friday period sales for the device.
The entertainment conglomerate is looking for a strong performance from the PS5, which is in its fourth year on the market, during the holiday shopping season to hit its sales target of a record 25 million units in the current financial year ending March 31.
“Given the momentum we’ve had in November and a lot of what we’re seeing in December, just in general we’re feeling very good about sales overall,” said Eric Lempel, senior vice president for global marketing, sales and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sony’s games business was its largest unit by sales and the second-biggest contributor to operating profit after music in the last financial year.
Management comments in August that PS5 sales had been weaker than expected led to jitters among investors. Sony has said its 25 million unit goal is a “high target and not within easy reach”, with the company looking to strike a good balance between sales volumes and profitability.
“We’ve done some good promotions this year. I will say we’ve done fewer promotions at this stage of the lifecycle than we ever have in the history of the company,” Lempel said in an interview.
PS5 sales were hampered by supply chain snarls earlier in its lifecycle. Those have eased, with it now gaining tailwinds including the Oct. 20 launch of critically acclaimed game “Marvel’s Spider-Man 2”.

The Japanese company, which is known for single-player games, is making a push into live-service titles, which offer continuous online play.
Sony’s Naughty Dog last week said it has cancelled an online game from its “The Last of Us” franchise, saying releasing it would have hit development of single-player titles.
The company’s sales push comes as the industry debates the future for consoles as advances in cloud technology promise gaming untethered from bulky hardware.
For now, consoles continue to draw gamers, with Nintendo’s ageing Switch getting a boost this year from the launch of games such as its latest “Zelda” title.
ADVERTISEMENT
Upcoming PlayStation titles include “The Last of Us Part II Remastered”, which launches in January, and limited-time exclusive “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth” in February.
“We are still pushing really hard and I think we will have a record-breaking year no matter where we end up,” Lempel said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/sony-highlights-ps5-momentum-as-hardware-sales-top-50-million-9076950/,technology

The users can also select a part of the text or an image and search and drag it to the side, up or down to get results from their preferred search engine in a new tab. ‘Super Drag and Drop’ is currently limited to those on the Beta, Dev and Canary builds.

Apple’s race against time to reverse Watch ban: Potential scenarios for the tech giant,The Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 may soon disappear from US stores over a patent dispute. We explain why.,"The unthinkable has happened: Apple’s latest smartwatches, namely the Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, may soon vanish from store shelves across the United States. An import ban related to a lengthy patent dispute is set to halt sales of the device beginning December 25, both online and in retail stores.
The ruling stems from a complaint filed by medical device company Masimo Corp., which accused Apple of infringing on patents involving blood oxygen measurement technology. Masimo sells its own health and wellness wearables that compete with the Apple Watch. While Apple has denied the claims over the years, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) sided with Masimo in October and moved to block imports of the allegedly infringing Apple product.

The most promising tech innovations of 2023,"From mixed-reality headsets to clippable AI wearables, these are the tech products that impressed us the most in 2023.","Consumer tech is languishing in a limbo created by cliché marketing and a refusal to innovate. And this is why the past year too saw a flurry of products across various categories — especially smartphones — that were almost predictable. However, there were a few exceptions that came as a breath of fresh air. Here is our pick of the most innovative tech products of 2023.
Apple Vision Pro: Before its debut, many theories were circulating, suggesting that Apple was making a mistake by launching a headset with no clear purpose. However, after the headset’s announcement, those who were criticising suddenly had a shift in perspective. The success or failure of a product is one thing; the Vision Pro is set to launch early next year and will retail for $3,499. No matter what people may say, Apple has taken a risk with the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset when the iPhone is at its peak. Now, whether the iPhone will coexist or get replaced by the headset, we don’t know, but at least Apple has taken a bold step by switching to a platform that could be the beginning of the spatial computing era. Sure, early hands-on demonstrations of the headset (and those who tried it) seem positive, but the truly exciting part of the Vision Pro is how you interact with the device. Just like how the iPhone brought pinch-to-zoom and made it the default form of interaction on mobile, Apple has figured out a way to interact in 3D space using your eyes and without a control device. That is a head-turner, which is why the Vision Pro made it to our list of the most innovative devices of 2023.

Sony’s game plans leaked online by hackers,"The files show the Japanese company plans to release several Marvel-inspired titles in the next decade, including ""Spider-Man 3"" and those based on Venom and X-Men, the report said.","Sony-owned Insomniac Games’ more than 1.3 million files, including game roadmaps, budgets and information about an upcoming “Wolverine” title, have been leaked online by the Rhysida ransomware group, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

Google plans ad sales restructuring as automation booms,"Sean Downey, who oversees ad sales to big customers in the Americas, said at a department-wide meeting last week that Google plans to restructure its ad sales teams without specifying whether the move would include layoffs, according to the report.","Alphabet-owned Google plans to reorganize a big part of its 30,000-person ad sales unit, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing a person with knowledge of the situation.
Sean Downey, who oversees ad sales to big customers in the Americas, said at a department-wide meeting last week that Google plans to restructure its ad sales teams without specifying whether the move would include layoffs, according to the report.
Google intended to consolidate staff, including through possible layoffs, by reassigning employees at its large customer sales unit who oversee relationships with major advertisers, the report said, citing another person briefed on Google’s plans.

The planned reorganization comes as Google is relying more on machine-learning techniques to help customers buy more ads on its search engine, YouTube and other services, the report added.
Google did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment.

The restrictions are set to be enforced by early 2024, the company said.
Aside from the U.S., a slew of groundbreaking elections are expected in 2024, including national elections in India, the world’s largest democracy, and South Africa, among others.

The tech giant said it will “work with an increased focus on the role artificial intelligence (AI) might play” as it looks to service voters and campaigns related to these elections.
Facebook-owner Meta had also said in November it is barring political campaigns and advertisers in other regulated industries from using its new generative AI advertising products.
Advertisers on Meta will also have to disclose when artificial intelligence (AI) or other digital methods are used to alter or create political, social or election related advertisements on Facebook and Instagram.
On the other hand, Elon Musk’s social media platform X, which is being probed by the European Union, said in August it would now allow political advertising in the U.S. from candidates and political parties. It will also expand its safety and elections team ahead of the U.S. election.

Here's how to watch it in India.,"If you are looking for a celestial treat this winter, you might want to catch a glimpse of the Ursid meteor shower, which is expected to peak on December 23. The Ursids are minor meteor showers that occur every year around the winter solstice, when the Earth passes through the debris left behind by comet 8P/Tuttle.
The Ursids are not as spectacular as the Geminids, which dazzled the sky earlier this month; but they still offer us a chance to see some shooting stars in the cold night. The Ursids produce about five to 10 meteors per hour at their peak, under ideal conditions.

"Google to pay $700 million to US states, consumers in app store settlement Washington",The settlement with the states includes $630 million to compensate US consumers funnelled into a payment processing system.,"Google has agreed to pay $700 million and make several other concessions to settle allegations that it had been stifling competition against its Android app store — the same issue that went to trial in another case that could result in even bigger changes.
Although Google struck the deal with state attorneys general in September, the settlement’s terms weren’t revealed until late Monday in documents filed in San Francisco federal court. The disclosure came a week after a federal court jury rebuked Google for deploying anti-competitive tactics in its Play Store for Android apps.
The settlement with the states includes $630 million to compensate US consumers funnelled into a payment processing system that state attorneys general alleged drove up the prices for digital transactions within apps downloaded from the Play Store. That store caters to the Android software that powers most of the world’s smartphones.
ADVERTISEMENT
Like Apple does in its iPhone app store, Google collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases — fees that state attorneys general contended drove prices higher than they would have been had there been an open market for payment processing. Those commissions generated billions of dollars in profit annually for Google, according to evidence presented in the recent trial focused on its Play Store.
Consumers eligible for a piece of the $630 million compensation fund are supposed to be automatically notified about various options for how they can receive their cut of the money.
Another $70 million of the pre-trial settlement will cover the penalties and other costs that Google is being forced to pay to the states.
Google also agreed to make other changes designed to make it even easier for consumers to download and install Android apps from other outlets besides its Play Store for the next five years. It will refrain from issuing as many security warnings, or “scare screens”, when alternative choices are being used.
The makers of Android apps will also gain more flexibility to offer alternative payment choices to consumers instead of having transactions automatically processed through the Play Store and its commission system. Apps will also be able to promote lower prices available to consumers who choose an alternative to the Play Store’s payment processing.
ADVERTISEMENT
Washington DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb hailed the settlement as a victory for the tens of millions of people in the US that rely on Android phones to help manage their lives. “For far too long, Google’s anticompetitive practices in the distribution of apps deprived Android users of choices and forced them to pay artificially elevated prices,” Schwalb said.
Wilson White, Google’s vice president of government affairs and public policy, framed the deal as a positive for the company, despite the money and concessions it entails. The settlement “builds on Android’s choice and flexibility, maintains strong security protections, and retains Google’s ability to compete with other (software) makers, and invest in the Android ecosystem for users and developers,” White wrote in a blog post.
Although the state attorneys general hailed the settlement as a huge win for consumers, it didn’t go far enough for Epic Games, which spearheaded the attack on Google’s app store practices with an antitrust lawsuit filed in August 2020.
Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, rebuffed the settlement in September and instead chose to take its case to trial, even though it had already lost on most of its key claims in a similar trial targeting Apple and its iPhone app store in 2021.
The Apple trial, though, was decided by a federal judge instead of the jury that vindicated Epic with a unanimous verdict that Google had built anticompetitive barriers around the Play Store. Google has vowed to appeal the verdict.
But the trial’s outcome nevertheless raises the spectre of Google potentially being ordered to pay even more money as punishment for its past practices and making even more dramatic changes to its lucrative Android app ecosystem.
Those changes will be determined next year by US District Judge James Donato, who presided over the Epic Games trial. Donato also still must approve Google’s Play Store settlement with the states.
ADVERTISEMENT
Google faces an even bigger legal threat in another antitrust case targeting its dominant search engine that serves as the centrepiece of a digital ad empire that generates more than $200 billion in sales annually. Closing arguments in a trial pitting Google against the Justice Department are scheduled for early May before a federal judge in Washington DC.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-to-pay-700-million-to-us-states-consumers-in-app-store-settlement-washington-9074916/,technology

Here's how to enable it.,"Google Chrome is one of the fastest and most popular internet browsers available right now. While Chrome is often regarded as a memory hog by many, the app’s simplistic user interface and responsiveness make up for it. However, a feature called ‘Hardware acceleration’ can make Chrome even faster.
By default, Chrome makes use of your machine’s CPU and software to render webpages and content. Enabling ‘Hardware acceleration’ will force the browser to make use of your machine’s graphic card to load web pages, which results in improved performance and responsiveness. It is helpful if you often visit graphic-heavy web pages or watch videos on the browser.

Benq V5000i Laser TV projector review: The mighty screen,"With ambitions to replace high-end televisions, the Benq V5000i runs the Android TV software with inbuilt Dolby Atmos audio technology.","The debate over whether a projector can replace a television was settled long back. Now, the question is how much better an experience a projector offers in the home compared to a television. And that is the question top-end Laser TV Projectors like the Benq V5000i want to address.
When I signed up for the Benq V5000i review, little did I know what I was getting into. I don’t mean that in a bad way. It is just that the Benq V5000i is a large projector, as large as projectors can be. It can be used with a 100-inch BenQ ALR Screen that ensures you have the best experience while using this projector. This means the projector is not fit for small homes like mine. But if you have a dedicated space that can be converted into a home theatre then this Benq projector should be in your reckoning.

"OpenAI outlines AI safety plan, allowing board to reverse decisions",Microsoft-backed OpenAI will only deploy its latest technology if it is deemed safe in specific areas such as cybersecurity and nuclear threats.,"Artificial intelligence company OpenAI laid out a framework to address safety in its most advanced models, including allowing the board to reverse safety decisions, according to a plan published on its website Monday.
Microsoft-backed OpenAI will only deploy its latest technology if it is deemed safe in specific areas such as cybersecurity and nuclear threats. The company is also creating an advisory group to review safety reports and send them to the company’s executives and board. While executives will make decisions, the board can reverse those decisions.
Since ChatGPT’s launch a year ago, the potential dangers of AI have been top of mind for both AI researchers and the general public. Generative AI technology has dazzled users with its ability to write poetry and essays, but also sparked safety concerns with its potential to spread disinformation and manipulate humans.
In April, a group of AI industry leaders and experts signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4, citing potential risks to society. A May Reuters/Ipsos poll found that more than two-thirds of Americans are concerned about the possible negative effects of AI and 61% believe it could threaten civilization.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-outlines-ai-safety-plan-allowing-board-to-reverse-decisions-9073874/,technology
"Apple to halt US sales of Series 9, Ultra 2 smartwatches over patent dispute",The move comes after an order in October from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that could bar Apple from importing its Apple Watches after finding the devices violate medical technology company Masimo's patent rights.,"Apple said on Monday it would pause sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States from this week, as it deals with a patent dispute over the technology that enables the blood oxygen feature on the devices.
The move comes after an order in October from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that could bar Apple from importing its Apple Watches after finding the devices violate medical technology company Masimo’s patent rights.
The decision is under review by President Joe Biden until Dec. 25, but Apple said it is taking steps to comply should the ruling stand. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the part of the Biden administration handling the case, said that Ambassador Katherine Tai “is carefully considering all factors in this case.”

If not vetoed, the ban would go into effect on Dec. 26.
The company said it would pause sales of the watches from its website starting on Dec. 21 and from Apple retail locations after Dec. 24. Other models that do not contain the blood oxygen sensor, like Apple’s lower-priced Apple Watch SE model, are unaffected by the dispute.
Ryan Reith, program vice president for research firm IDC’s mobile device tracking efforts, said that U.S. holiday sales of Apple Watches will not suffer and that the full impact of the ruling, if it stands, will come in January and February, typically some of Apple’s slowest sales months in the U.S.
“Apple has plenty of inventory of Watch 8 and SE so they will have products available during that time,” Reith said. “The bigger implication is around whether or not Apple can use the blood oxygen sensor technology that is in question on future devices, or if they’ll have to reach a settlement or come up with a new solution.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Masimo CEO Joe Kiani told CNBC in October that he was open to negotiating a deal with Apple. In a statement on Monday, Masimo said the ITC decision “should be respected, protecting intellectual property rights and maintaining public trust in the United States’ patent system and encouraging US industry.”
Apple has about a quarter of the global smartwatch market, according to Counterpoint Research – a share that tends to rise to more than a third in the fourth quarter during the U.S. and European holiday sales seasons. Both the Series 9 and the Ultra 2 would remain available for purchase outside of the United States, including during the Lunar New Year season in Asia.
Apple said it believes the ITC’s finding was erroneous, should be reversed and that it intends to appeal the decision to the Federal Circuit.
Apple shares closed 0.9% lower on Monday.
Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.
ADVERTISEMENT
A jury trial on Masimo’s allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in a federal court in Delaware and has called Masimo’s legal actions a “maneuver to clear a path” for its own competing smartwatch.
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected Apple’s requests to review the validity of the patents at issue in the ITC decision earlier this year.

Engineers at Apple are moving to make changes to algorithms in the smartwatches, adjusting how the technology determines oxygen saturation and presents the data to customers, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the work.
Apple is working on a range of legal and technical options, if the ban holds. It has begun preparing stores for the change, sending new signs to its retail outlets that promote the Apple Watch without showing photos of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 — two models targeted by the ban, the report added.
ADVERTISEMENT
An Apple spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the company is working on submitting a workaround to the U.S. customs agency, which is in charge of approving changes to get a product back on the market.
“The patents in question cover hardware. Masimo believes that Apple needs to change the hardware,” a Masimo spokesperson told Reuters about the Bloomberg report, while Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
Apple did not comment on Bloomberg’s report but earlier on Monday said it was working on “technical options” to ensure Apple Watches are available to customers and that it would “take all measures” to get the devices back to shelves if the ITC order stands.
A presidential administration has not vetoed an ITC ruling since 2013, when President Barack Obama’s administration overturned an import ban on Apple’s iPhones and iPads from a patent dispute with Samsung.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Biden administration in February chose not to veto a separate import ban on Apple Watches based on a patent-infringement complaint from medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC has placed the ban on hold for other reasons.

India to allot satellite internet airwaves without auction in win for Musk,"The proposal was included in a new draft bill for the telecommunications sector, which seeks to replace the 138-year old Indian Telegraph Act that currently governs the sector.","India has proposed a licensing approach to assigning spectrum for satellite internet services and exempt companies from having to bid for it, a win for Elon Musk’s venture Starlink which has lobbied hard against any auctions.
The proposal was included in a new draft bill for the telecommunications sector, which seeks to replace the 138-year old Indian Telegraph Act that currently governs the sector. The bill was tabled for approval in parliament on Monday.
While Starlink and its global peers like Amazon’s Project Kuiper, and the British government-backed OneWeb would rejoice in the move, it is a setback to Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s wealthiest, who runs Indian telecom giant Reliance Jio.
ADVERTISEMENT
The foreign firms have been demanding a licensing approach, concerned that an auction by India unlike elsewhere will raise the likelihood of other nations following suit, increasing costs and investments, Reuters had reported in June.
Reliance Jio, country’s biggest telecom operator, however had disagreed and told government that an auction is the right approach, similar to 5G spectrum distribution in India. Foreign satellite service providers could offer voice and data services and compete with traditional telecom players, and so there must be an auction to achieve a level playing field, Reliance had argued.
“By bypassing traditional auctions, this pragmatic method is poised to expedite the deployment of satellite services more efficiently,” said Anil Prakash, Director General at SIA-India, a satellite industry body.
India’s satellite broadband service market is expected to grow 36% a year to reach $1.9 billion by 2030, according to Deloitte.

"Adobe, Figma to terminate $20 bln deal over regulatory hurdles","The deal, which was announced in September last year, was the latest to draw tough scrutiny from regulators worried over Big Tech acquisitions that boost dominant companies' market power or involve startups seen as nascent rivals.","Adobe on Monday shelved its $20 billion cash-and-stock deal for cloud-based designer platform Figma, pointing to “no clear path” for approvals from antitrust regulators in the European Union and the UK.
The deal, which was announced in September last year, was the latest to draw tough scrutiny from regulators worried over Big Tech acquisitions that boost dominant companies’ market power or involve startups seen as nascent rivals.
Shares of the Photoshop and Illustrator maker, which will pay a termination fee of $1 billion to Figma, rose about 1.7% premarket on Monday.

The European Commission and UK’s Competition and Markets Authority did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Adobe had argued it does not compete with Figma in any meaningful way.
It had said in November its only product relevant to the antitrust question was the Adobe XD design tool, which lost $25 million as a standalone app over the last three years and has only five full-time employees.

“Adobe and Figma strongly disagree with the recent regulatory findings, but we believe it is in our respective best interests to move forward independently,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in a statement on Monday.
The deal was seen a bet on “the future of work” but sparked investor concerns over the rich price tag and wiped out more than $30 billion in Adobe’s market value when it was announced.
It was also a major win for Figma’s venture capital backers, including Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins.

The Commission said it will now carry out an in-depth investigation as a matter of priority and continue to gather evidence by sending additional requests for information, conducting interviews and inspections.
X, owned by Elon Musk, is part of a group of large tech companies facing increased scrutiny under the DSA.
Following Hamas’ attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, EU industry chief Thierry Breton sent letters to X, Meta, TikTok and Alphabet reminding them of their obligations under the DSA to tackle harmful and illegal content.

X did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

iQOO 12 design: Fresh and premium
The iQOO 12 stands out from other smartphones in the market due to its large camera island on the back, now housing three high-resolution sensors. The legend edition of the iQOO 12, featuring a satin-like glass back panel and a BMW M Motorsports logo, exudes premium aesthetics typical of devices in this price range. However, the flat side frame and glossy back panel make it somewhat slippery, and the device is prone to smudges and fingerprints. These issues can be easily mitigated by using the transparent soft case included with the phone.

Chinese firms look to Malaysia for assembly of high-end chips,"The companies are asking Malaysian chip packaging firms to assemble a type of chip known as graphics processing units (GPUs), according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.","A growing number of Chinese semiconductor design companies are tapping Malaysian firms to assemble a portion of their high-end chips, keen to hedge risks in case the U.S. expands sanctions on China’s chip industry, sources said.
The companies are asking Malaysian chip packaging firms to assemble a type of chip known as graphics processing units (GPUs), according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The requests only encompass assembly – which does not contravene any U.S. restrictions – and not fabrication of the chip wafers, they said. Some contracts have already been agreed, two of the people added.
ADVERTISEMENT
The people declined to disclose the names of the companies involved or to be identified, citing confidentiality agreements.
Seeking to limit China’s access to high-end GPUs that could fuel artificial intelligence breakthroughs or power supercomputers and military applications, Washington has increasingly placed restrictions on their sales as well as on sophisticated chip-making equipment.
As those sanctions bite and an AI boom fuels demand, smaller Chinese semiconductor design firms are struggling to secure sufficient advanced packaging services at home, analysts have said.
Some of the Chinese companies are interested in advanced chip packaging services, two people said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Advanced packaging of chips can significantly improve chip performance and is emerging as a critical technology in the semiconductor industry. This sometimes involves the construction of chiplets where chips are packaged tightly to work together as one powerful brain.
Although not subject to U.S. export restrictions, it’s an area that can require sophisticated technology which the firms worry might one day be targeted for curbs on exports to China, the two people added.
Malaysia, a major hub in the semiconductor supply chain, is seen as well placed to grab further business as Chinese chip firms diversify outside of China for assembling needs.
Unisem, majority owned by China’s Huatian Technology, and other Malaysian chip packaging companies have seen increased business and inquiries from Chinese clients, said one source who was briefed on the matter.
ADVERTISEMENT
Unisem Chairman John Chia declined to comment on the company’s clients but said: “Due to trade sanctions and supply chain issues, many Chinese chip design houses have come to Malaysia to establish additional sources of supply outside of China to support their business in and out of China.”
Chinese chip design firms also see Malaysia as a good option because the country is perceived as being on good terms with China, is affordable, with an experienced workforce and sophisticated equipment, two of the sources said.
Asked whether accepting orders to assemble GPUs from Chinese firms could potentially provoke U.S. ire, Chia said Unisem’s business dealings were “fully legitimate and compliant” and the company did not have the time to worry over “too many possibilities”.
He noted that most of Unisem’s customers in Malaysia were from the United States.
ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.
Other big chip packaging firms in the country include Malaysian Pacific Industries and Inari Amertron. They did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Chinese companies are also interested in having their chips assembled outside China as that could also make it easier to sell their products in non-Chinese markets, said one source, an investor in two Chinese chip startups.
A MAJOR HUB
Malaysia currently accounts for 13% of the global market for semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing and is aiming to boost that to 15% by 2030.
ADVERTISEMENT
Chinese chip firms that have announced plans to expand in Malaysia include Xfusion, a former Huawei unit, which said in September it would partner with Malaysia’s NationGate to manufacture GPU servers – servers designed for data centres and which are used in AI and high-performance computing.
Shanghai-based StarFive is also building a design centre in Penang, and chip packaging and testing firm TongFu Microelectronics said last year it would expand its Malaysia facility – a venture with U.S. chipmaker AMD.
Offering an array of incentives, Malaysia has attracted multi-billion dollar chip investments. Germany’s Infineon said in August it would invest 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) to expand its power chip plant there.
U.S. chipmaker Intel announced in 2021 that it would build a $7 billion advanced chip packaging plant in Malaysia.
ADVERTISEMENT
Chinese companies are not just choosing Malaysia. In 2021, JCET Group, the world’s third-largest chip assembly and testing company, completed an acquisition of an advanced testing facility in Singapore.
Other countries such as Vietnam and India are also seeking to expand further into chip manufacturing services, hoping to lure clients keen to minimise U.S.-Sino geopolitical risks.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/chinese-firms-look-to-malaysia-for-assembly-of-high-end-chips-9072398/,technology

Now, the app will automatically bump emails to the top of the inbox if the delivery date changes.
The information will appear on the main page below the email’s subject in orange on Gmail’s Inbox page. This can come in handy since users will no longer have to scour their inbox to find out how many days it will take for their delivery to arrive.

Watch this space: Aliens and ocean worlds and speaking to whales,"In our solar system, the space agency found the presence of a key ingredient of life and powerful energy sources that can trigger it.","This week was big in the search for aliens. A NASA study looking for life beyond the solar system has discovered 17 exoplanets that could have oceans of liquid water beneath their icy shells. Much closer, in our solar system, the space agency found the presence of a key ingredient of life and powerful energy sources that can trigger it. We also spoke to humpback whales.
But what do humpback whales have to do with aliens? On the face of it, not much. But researchers at SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence), the University of California Davis and the Alaska Whale Foundation found a way to communicate with the sea-dwelling giants. This “close encounter” could help us develop “intelligence filters” that will come in use if and when we get in touch with an alien intelligence.

Activision to pay $50 million to settle workplace discrimination lawsuit,Activision will take additional steps to ensure fair pay and promotion practices and provide monetary relief to women who were employees or contract workers.,"Activision Blizzard will pay roughly $50 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit by a California regulator that alleged the videogame maker discriminated against women employees, including denying them promotion opportunities and underpaying them.
California’s Civil Rights Department (CRD) had sued the “Call of Duty” maker after two years of investigation over allegations that it routinely underpaid and failed to promote female employees and condoned sexual harassment.
The CRD will withdraw the allegations of systemic sexual harassment, according to the settlement agreement, seen by Reuters. The remaining allegations resolved by the agreement included that Activision discriminated against women, including by denying promotion opportunities and paying them less than men for doing substantially similar work, the CRD said in a statement on Friday.

Activision will take additional steps to ensure fair pay and promotion practices and provide monetary relief to women who were employees or contract workers in California between Oct. 12, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2020, as part of the agreement, which is subject to court approval, the CRD statement said.
“In the settlement agreement, the CRD expressly acknowledged that ‘no court or independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard’,” the videogame maker said in a statement on Friday.
The company also said that no investigation substantiated that its board or chief executive acted improperly in handling instances of workplace misconduct.
Activision, which was bought in October by Microsoft for nearly $69 billion, agreed in 2021 to pay up to $18 million to settle similar claims made by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/activision-50-million-workplace-discrimination-9070518/,technology

Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet review: The large-hearted air cleaner,The Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet is for large homes with huge open spaces or office floors.,"“Dad, what’s this gadget?” My 12-year-old, who has seen his fair share of crazy gadgets, is surprised at the latest contraption I have unboxed at home. “It’s an indoor satellite receiver,” I reply in jest.

The Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet is true to its name. It is big and it is quiet, despite its size. And it is big for a reason. This is not the regular air purifier you would buy for your small bedroom. This one is meant for those with really large spaces, up to 1076 sq ft, and has been designed keeping that specific use case in mind. And it has also been designed to be quiet, which I think is a significant achievement in this case.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/dyson-purifier-big-quiet-review-9069810/,technology

Pope Francis calls for binding global treaty to regulate AI,"Pope Francis, who has often criticised the armaments industry, warned against the use of AI in weapons systems, saying it could lead to a global catastrophe.","Pope Francis has called for a legally binding international treaty to regulate artificial intelligence, saying algorithms must not be allowed to replace human values and warning of a “technological dictatorship” threatening human existence.
The pope made his call on Thursday in a message for the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Peace, which is celebrated on Jan. 1. The title of the message, which is traditionally sent to world leaders and heads of institutions such as the United Nations, is “Artificial Intelligence and Peace”.
It came as governments around the world are seeking to balance the advantages of the technology, which can engage in human-like conversations, answer questions and write computer code, against the need to put guard rails in place.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The global scale of artificial intelligence makes it clear that, alongside the responsibility of sovereign states to regulate its use internally, international organizations can play a decisive role in reaching multilateral agreements and coordinating their application and enforcement,” Francis wrote in the message.
“I urge the global community of nations to work together in order to adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of artificial intelligence in its many forms,” the pope said.
Last week, the European Union reached a provisional deal on landmark rules governing the use of AI, including governments’ use of AI in biometric surveillance and how to regulate AI systems such as ChatGPT.
NEW AI APPLICATIONS
The pope’s call also came as companies like OpenAI, in which Microsoft is an investor, continue to discover new uses for their technology, triggering both plaudits and concerns. Google owner Alphabet last week launched a new AI model, Gemini, to rival OpenAI.
ADVERTISEMENT
Francis called for ethical scrutiny of the “aims and interest of (AI’s) owners and developers” warning that some applications of AI “may pose a risk to our survival and endanger our common home,” a reference to the earth.
“In an obsessive desire to control everything, we risk losing control over ourselves; in the quest for an absolute freedom, we risk falling into the spiral of a ‘technological dictatorship,'” he wrote.
Francis, who has often criticised the armaments industry, warned against the use of AI in weapons systems, saying it could lead to a global catastrophe.
“Research on emerging technologies in the area of so-called Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, including the weaponization of artificial intelligence, is a cause for grave ethical concern. Autonomous weapon systems can never be morally responsible subjects,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The “unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making” could not be left to a machine, he said, adding that “it is imperative to ensure adequate, meaningful and consistent human oversight of weapon systems”.
At a news conference presenting the message, Cardinal Michael Czerny, head of the Vatican’s human development office, said the 86-year-old pope was “no luddite,” a term referring to someone opposed to new technology.
He said the pope appreciates technological and scientific progress that serves humanity but that Francis was particularly concerned about AI because it is “perhaps the highest-stake gamble of our future”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/pope-francis-artificial-intelligence-9069304/,technology
Intel says dozens of PC makers are using its new AI-enabled chip,"Intel also showed what it said was the first working version of a chip called Gaudi 3, which it hopes will challenge Nvidia in the data center AI market.","Intel on Thursday said that dozens of personal computer makers are using its newest chip, as the company and its customers try to entice consumers to upgrade their machines for a new era of chatbots.
At a press event in New York, Intel said the new offering will be available in laptops from Dell Technologies, Microsoft, Lenovo Group and others that will go on sale on Thursday at Best Buy in the U.S. and other global retailers including China’s JD.com and Australia’s Harvey Norman.
Intel shares rose as much as 3.6% after the news.
Intel’s central processor units (CPUs) have long served as the brains of most personal computers. But the new chip that went by the code name “Meteor Lake” is Intel’s first that will also contain what is called an neural processing unit (NPU), a section of the chip dedicated to handling artificial intelligence tasks.

Intel’s pitch to consumers and businesses comes as it is fighting its way out of a post-pandemic PC slump where buyers who upgraded to work from home in 2020 have seen little reason to buy new equipment.
Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said during the event that Intel believes using its chips will make AI services cheaper, faster and more private than using services based in cloud data centers.
“That will be the star of the show in this coming year,” Gelsinger said of AI on PCs. “You’re unleashing this power for every person, every use case, every location in the future.”
During a demonstration of the new chip in September, the company showed some examples of AI work that it hoped would spur interest, such as transcribing voice notes without having to send data to a third-party cloud provider or generating a song in the style of pop star Taylor Swift.
Intel on Thursday also showed what it said was the first working version of a chip called Gaudi 3, which it hopes will challenge Nvidia in the data center AI market.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/intel-pc-makers-ai-chip-9069290/,technology

"2023: The year we played with artificial intelligence, and weren’t sure what to do about it","In 2023, advances in AI like ChatGPT sparked excitement but also fears about impacts on jobs, media, and security. Regulation attempts emerged amidst hype.","Artificial intelligence went mainstream in 2023 — it was a long time coming yet has a long way to go for the technology to match people’s science fiction fantasies of human-like machines.
Catalyzing a year of AI fanfare was ChatGPT. The chatbot gave the world a glimpse of recent advances in computer science even if not everyone figured out quite how it works or what to do with it.
“I would call this an inflection moment,” pioneering AI scientist Fei-Fei Li said. “2023 is, in history, hopefully going to be remembered for the profound changes of the technology as well as the public awakening. It also shows how messy this technology is.”
ADVERTISEMENT
It was a year for people to figure out “what this is, how to use it, what’s the impact — all the good, the bad and the ugly,” she said.
Panic over AI
The first AI panic of 2023 set in soon after New Year’s Day when classrooms reopened and schools from Seattle to Paris started blocking ChatGPT. Teenagers were already asking the chatbot — released in late 2022 — to compose essays and answer take-home tests.
AI large language models behind technology such as ChatGPT work by repeatedly guessing the next word in a sentence after having “learned” the patterns of a huge trove of human-written works. They often get facts wrong. But the outputs appeared so natural that it sparked curiosity about the next AI advances and its potential use for trickery and deception.

Worries escalated as this new cohort of generative AI tools — spitting out not just words but novel images, music and synthetic voices — threatened the livelihoods of anyone who writes, draws, strums or codes for a living. It fueled strikes by Hollywood writers and actors and legal challenges from visual artists and bestselling authors.
ADVERTISEMENT
Some of the AI field’s most esteemed scientists warned that the technology’s unchecked progress was marching toward outsmarting humans and possibly threatening their existence, while other scientists called their concerns overblown or brought attention to more immediate risks.
By spring, AI-generated deepfakes — some more convincing than others — had leaped into U.S. election campaigns, where one falsely showed Donald Trump embracing the nation’s former top infectious disease expert. The technology made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fabricated war footage in Ukraine and Gaza.
By the end of the year, the AI crises had shifted to ChatGPT’s own maker, the San Francisco startup OpenAI, nearly destroyed by corporate turmoil over its charismatic CEO, and to a government meeting room in Belgium, where exhausted political leaders from across the European Union emerged after days of intense talks with a deal for the world’s first major AI legal safeguards.

The new AI law won’t take effect until 2025, and other lawmaking bodies — including the U.S. Congress — are still a long way from enacting their own.

Too much hype?
There’s no question that commercial AI products unveiled in 2023 incorporated technological achievements not possible in earlier stages of AI research, which trace back to the mid-20th century.
But the latest generative AI trend is at peak hype, according to the market research firm Gartner, which has tracked what it calls the “hype cycle” of emerging technology since the 1990s. Picture a wooden rollercoaster ticking up to its highest hill, about to careen down into what Gartner describes as a “trough of disillusionment” before coasting back to reality.
“Generative AI is right in the peak of inflated expectations,” Gartner analyst Dave Micko said. “There’s massive claims by vendors and producers of generative AI around its capabilities, its ability to deliver those capabilities.”
Google drew criticism this month for editing a video demonstration of its most capable AI model, called Gemini, in a way that made it appear more impressive — and human-like.
ADVERTISEMENT
Micko said leading AI developers are pushing certain ways of applying the latest technology, most of which correspond to their current line of products — be they search engines or workplace productivity software. That doesn’t mean that’s how the world will use it.
“As much as Google and Microsoft and Amazon and Apple would love us to adopt the way that they think about their technology and that they deliver that technology, I think adoption actually comes from the bottom up,” he said.
Is it different this time?
It’s easy to forget that this isn’t the first wave of AI commercialization. Computer vision techniques developed by Li and other scientists helped sort through a huge database of photos to recognize objects and individual faces and help guide self-driving cars. Speech recognition advances made voice assistants like Siri and Alexa a fixture in many people’s lives.
“When we launched Siri in 2011, it was at that point the fastest-growing consumer app and the only major mainstream application of AI that people had ever experienced,” said Tom Gruber, co-founder of Siri Inc., which Apple bought and made an integral iPhone feature.
ADVERTISEMENT
But Gruber believes what’s happening now is the “biggest wave ever” in AI, unleashing new possibilities as well as dangers.

“We’re surprised that we could accidentally encounter this astonishing ability with language, by training a machine to play solitaire on all of the internet,” Gruber said. “It’s kind of amazing.”
The dangers could come fast in 2024, as major national elections in the U.S., India and elsewhere could get flooded with AI-generated deepfakes.
In the longer term, AI technology’s rapidly improving language, visual perception and step-by-step planning capabilities could supercharge the vision of a digital assistant — but only if granted access to the “inner loop of our digital life stream,” Gruber said.

“They can manage your attention as in, ‘You should watch this video. You should read this book. You should respond to this person’s communication,’” Gruber said. “That is what a real executive assistant does.

Tesla recalls nearly all vehicles on US roads over lack of Autopilot safeguards,"Tesla's Autopilot is intended to enable cars to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within their lane, while enhanced Autopilot can assist in changing lanes on highways but does not make vehicles autonomous.","Tesla is recalling over 2 million vehicles in the U.S. to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system, after a federal safety regulator cited safety concerns.
The largest-ever Tesla recall appears to cover nearly all vehicles on U.S. roads to better ensure drivers pay attention when using the system. Tesla’s recall filing said that Autopilot’s software system controls “may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse” and could increase the risk of a crash.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has spent over two years investigating whether vehicles produced by the electric automaker led by billionaire Elon Musk adequately ensure drivers pay attention.
ADVERTISEMENT
Acting NHTSA Administrator Ann Carlson praised Tesla for agreeing to the recall. “One of the things we determined is that drivers are not always paying attention when that system is on,” she said at a U.S. House hearing.
Carlson said the agency opened a safety probe in August 2021 when she kept hearing about fatal crashes involving use of Autopilot. “My immediate response was, ‘We have to do something about this,'” she said.

Separately, Transport Canada said Tesla will recall 193,000 vehicles to address the Autopilot issue. It was not immediately clear if China will demand a recall.
Tesla shares were flat Wednesday afternoon.
Tesla’s Autopilot is intended to enable cars to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within their lane, while enhanced Autopilot can assist in changing lanes on highways but does not make vehicles autonomous.
ADVERTISEMENT
One component of Autopilot is Autosteer, which maintains a set speed or following distance and works to keep a vehicle in its driving lane.
Tesla said it did not agree with NHTSA’s analysis but would deploy an over-the-air software update that will “incorporate additional controls and alerts to those already existing on affected vehicles to further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility whenever Autosteer is engaged.”
U.S. Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal said the recall “is critically needed to make Tesla’s cars safer, but it is egregiously overdue… We urge NHTSA to continue its investigations to spur necessary recalls, and Tesla to stop misleading drivers and putting the public in great danger.”
NHTSA said its investigation into Autopilot will remain open as it monitors Tesla’s remedies.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tesla did not respond to a question on the extent of the recall worldwide or give more precise details of the new safeguards.
‘FORESEEABLE MISUSE’
NHTSA opened its August 2021 probe of Autopilot after identifying more than a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles hit stationary emergency vehicles. The probe was upgraded in June 2022.
NHTSA said it found Autopilot “can provide inadequate driver engagement and usage controls that can lead to foreseeable misuse.” NHTSA reviewed 956 crashes where Autopilot was initially alleged to have been in use and focused on 322 Autopilot-involved crashes.
Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor, said the software-only fix will be fairly limited. The recall “really seems to put so much responsibility on human drivers instead of a system that facilitates such misuse.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Donald Slavik, an attorney representing multiple people suing Tesla alleging Autopilot defects, said some jurisdictions including California could allow plaintiffs to introduce the NHTSA recall into evidence, as well as other post-accident fixes made by Tesla. At the same time, plaintiffs still must prove the defect involved in the recall caused their particular accident.
“This is one step … but it’s not a determination in any case,” Slavik said.
Separately, since 2016, NHTSA has opened more than three dozen Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to date.
NHTSA said there may be increased crash risks when Autopilot is engaged but drivers do not maintain responsibility and is unprepared to intervene.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tesla will roll out the update to 2.03 million Model S, X, 3 and Y vehicles in the U.S. dating back to 2012, the agency said.
The update based on vehicle hardware will include increasing prominence of visual alerts, simplifying engagement and disengagement of Autosteer and additional checks upon engaging Autosteer.
Tesla disclosed in October the U.S. Justice Department issued subpoenas related to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot. Reuters reported in October 2022 that Tesla was under criminal investigation.
Tesla in February recalled 362,000 U.S. vehicles to update its FSD Beta software after NHTSA said the vehicles did not adequately adhere to traffic safety laws and could cause crashes.

Users will be able to pin all sorts of messages including text, polls, emojis, locations and images.
With the ever-increasing popularity of instant messaging apps in the last few years, WhatsApp users have been asking the Meta-owned company to add the Telegram-like functionality for quite a while now.

Apple’s innovative ‘Stolen Device Protection’ mode sets new bar for iPhone security,Apple makes it harder to hack into a stolen iPhone with the new security feature.,"There is nothing more dangerous than a lost iPhone with a compromised password, and Apple is smartly addressing this issue. Currently, Apple is developing a new “Stolen Device Protection” mode, requiring users to input both the passcode and complete Face ID biometric authentication to access sensitive information on iPhones.
“As threats to user devices continue to evolve, we work tirelessly to develop powerful new protections for our users and their data. iPhone data encryption has long led the industry, and a thief can’t access data on a stolen iPhone without knowing the user’s passcode. In the rare cases where a thief can observe the user entering the passcode and then steal the device, Stolen Device Protection adds a sophisticated new layer of protection,” said an Apple spokesperson.

Apple offers to let rivals access tap-and-go tech in EU antitrust case,"The EU competition enforcer last year charged Apple with curbing rivals' access to its tap-and-go technology, Near-Field Communication (NFC), making it difficult for them to develop rival services on Apple devices.","Apple has offered to let rivals access its tap-and-go mobile payments systems used for mobile wallets, three people familiar with the matter said, a move that could settle EU antitrust charges and stave off a possible hefty fine.
The EU competition enforcer last year charged Apple with curbing rivals’ access to its tap-and-go technology, Near-Field Communication (NFC), making it difficult for them to develop rival services on Apple devices.
It said this benefited Apple Pay, Apple’s own mobile wallet solution on iPhones and iPads, and pointed to the company’s significant market power in the market for smart mobile devices and dominance in mobile wallet markets.

The European Commission is likely to seek feedback next month from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept Apple’s offer, the people said.
They said the timing of the market test and whether it will go ahead could still change.
The EU watchdog declined to comment. Apple was not immediately available for comment before U.S. working hours.
Apple Pay is used by more than 2,500 banks in Europe and over 250 fintechs and challenger banks. The NFC chip enables tap-and-go payments on iPhones and iPads.

Apple faces a second charge of preventing Spotify and other music streaming companies from informing users of other buying options outside its App Store in a case dating from 2020.
The Commission is expected to issue a decision next year that could include a fine and an order to stop this practice.

Apple now requires a judge’s consent to hand over push notification data,The new policy was not formally announced but appeared sometime over the past few days on Apple's publicly available law enforcement guidelines.,"Apple has said it now requires a judge’s order to hand over information about its customers’ push notification to law enforcement, putting the iPhone maker’s policy in line with rival Google and raising the hurdle officials must clear to get app data about users.
The new policy was not formally announced but appeared sometime over the past few days on Apple’s publicly available law enforcement guidelines. It follows the revelation from Oregon Senator Ron Wyden that officials were requesting such data from Apple as well as from Google, the unit of Alphabet that makes the operating system for Android phones.
Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible “dings” or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple’s servers.

In a letter first disclosed by Reuters last week, Wyden said the practice gave the two companies unique insight into traffic flowing from those apps to users, putting them “in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps.”
Apple and Google both acknowledged receiving such requests. Apple added a passage to its guidelines saying such data was available “with a subpoena or greater legal process.” The passage has now been updated to refer to more stringent warrant requirements.
Apple did not offer an official statement. Google did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
Wyden said in a statement that Apple was “doing the right thing by matching Google and requiring a court order to hand over push notification related data.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-now-requires-a-judges-consent-to-hand-over-push-notification-data-9065960/,technology
Google’s court loss to Epic Games may cost billions but final outcome years away,"A jury in California found on Monday that the Alphabet-owned company's Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, quashing competition and charging app developers unduly high fees of up to 30%.","Google’s stunning defeat in a legal battle with “Fortnite” maker Epic Games may clear the way for rival app stores on its Android mobile system but a lengthy appeals process will likely prevent any changes for years, according to analysts and legal experts.
A jury in California found on Monday that the Alphabet-owned company’s Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, quashing competition and charging app developers unduly high fees of up to 30%.
Epic Games will now have a chance to submit a court filing on how it wants Google’s Play Store to be fixed — potentially putting at risk what Wells Fargo estimates is $10 billion in annual revenue from app sales and in-app purchases for the tech giant.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This is a big win for Epic,” said Pinar Akman, professor of competition law at the University of Leeds.
“The usual remedy in such case … would mean Google may be required to allow developers to use payment systems other than Google’s. If such a remedy is adopted, then that will have an impact on the entire ecosystem and business model.”
Google takes a cut on each digital purchase through Play Store on Android, the mobile system it develops. While revenue from such transactions is a fraction of the total sales, it’s a high-margin business for the company, according to analysts.
The remedies could force it to allow rival app stores or lower the fees it charges on app sales and in-app purchases.
Alphabet shares were down nearly 1% on Tuesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
The unanimous ruling by the jury will intensify pressure on Google at a time it is caught in a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), which has accused the online search leader of breaking antitrust law to stay on top.
“It’s worth noting the ad tech case is also a jury trial. Ad tech is more complicated than app stores, but DOJ still must be feeling encouraged by last night’s jury ruling,” analysts at TD Cowen said.
The decision is also expected to deepen questions over Apple’s market dominance. The company won a similar fight against Epic but both the companies have approached the Supreme Court to review their dispute.
While it may not directly impact the case, the Google ruling will amplify questions about the influence Apple exerts through its App Store, said Eleanor Fox, professor emerita at the New York University School of Law.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Apple might be and should be more concerned that it will be found to be a monopoly,” Fox said.
LENGTHY APPEALS PROCESS
Google has said it will appeal the verdict, and the case will head to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That is the same court that heard Epic’s arguments last year to revive its antitrust claims against Apple.
In January, U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco will weigh Epic’s request for an injunction. Epic and Google will face off for a second time in court — before the judge only.
Google would likely argue that the proposed injunction is too broad and needs to be more tailored.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s not so much will there be an injunction but the strength and scope of that remedy,” said antitrust legal scholar Christine Bartholomew of the University at Buffalo School of Law in New York.
Still, analysts expect Google to appeal any remedy orders from Judge Donato, delaying any potential changes.
“Using the timeline in Epic v. Apple as a guide, the 9th Circuit would likely rule around Q2 2025,” TD Cowen said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/googles-court-loss-to-epic-games-may-cost-billions-but-final-outcome-years-away-9065950/,technology

Apple MacBook Pro M3 review: What else does one need?,The new 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 is a perfect upgrade from Intel-era MacBook Pro.,"During the pandemic, I made a major shift and became a full-time Mac user. Before we were all confined to our homes, I used to switch between my MacBook Air for personal stuff and writing to the Windows workstation at the office for all official work. Stuck at home for close to two years, I did not have the second option and life became a lot simpler. In 2021, I made another shift, this time to the first MacBook Pro running on Apple silicon. And since then I have been using this device as my go-to computer. Now, maybe it is time to shift again, to the new 14-inch MacBook Pro powered by the M3 Apple silicon.
Interestingly, though two years have passed since the M1 MacBook Pro (review) was launched, the new version is almost identical in looks to the 2021 edition. So much so, that if during set-up I had used the copy from the old Mac option, then even I would not have been able to differentiate between the two. Yes, there would have been one difference, that the new version was running macOS Sonoma out of the box. There is one small difference when it comes to ports — this has one USB-C port less than the 2021 model. Thankfully, Apple has not removed the HDMI port, which for me is an essential feature as I am always using the MacBook Pro to power a TV when talking to the team or having Zoom calls.

‘India will be global leader in conversations around AI regulation’: Google executive Markham Erickson,"Generative AI is a consequential transition, to move into a full AI ecosystem… There is a tremendous amount of innovation that's happening and a tremendous amount of competition.","Interoperability in global legislations around artificial intelligence will be among the most crucial aspects going ahead, especially for smaller businesses who may find it difficult to navigate conflicting and complicated regulations around the world, said Markham Erickson, vice president, government affairs and public policy at Google’s Centers for Excellence. In an interaction with Soumyarendra Barik & Anil Sasi, he also spoke about safe harbour protections for generative AI platforms, regulatory challenges to AI, and how Google’s relationship could change with news publishers going forward. Edited excerpts:
With the US’ executive order on AI, America seems to have taken a rare lead over Europe in regulations for the sector. Does that help American Big Tech companies?
There are parallels to the mid-’90s at the beginning of the commercial internet, where stakeholders are having to get together and think about the norms that should apply, and how existing laws need to be amended to account for the new technology. And in the mid-’90s, the United States took the lead… saying we should have a hands-off approach to the internet to let this nascent industry develop. And then that was followed by Europe with the e-commerce directive.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/markham-erickson-on-ai-regulation-artificial-intelligence-talks-on-ai-regulation-9062697/,technology
Under a thousand: Wired for speed…charging speed,This cable will showcase exactly how fast your smartphone/laptop is charging.,"The days when you plugged in your device and left it to be charged overnight while you slept are over. Once not considered even important enough to merit a mention, charging speeds have suddenly become a very important part of product spec sheets. Whether it is a smartphone, notebook, tablet or even a third-party charger, just how fast it can charge or be charged is becoming increasingly important. We now have chargers in the device (proprietary as well as third party) which can charge compatible devices with speeds that range from a mere 5W to a massive 150W. Even portable power banks come with fast charging support and can charge devices at speeds of close to 100W. One can now recharge a device with a large 5000 mAh battery in under half an hour.
The cable has a tiny LED screen (Express Photo)
Fast charging is cool, but how do we know if it is working
All of which is wonderful. But there is a catch – there is actually no straightforward way of finding out actually HOW fast your device is being powered up by a charger. Unless you are willing to fiddle around with settings and/or download apps, you generally cannot find out the speed at which a charger is juicing up your gadget. This can make things a little tricky when you invest in a third-party charger or use a charger to power up different devices.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/usams-100w-usbc-cable-with-display-review-9062241/,technology

"Microsoft, OpenAI tie-up comes under antitrust scrutiny","After the dramatic episode last month, Microsoft, a major OpenAI backer, was granted a non-voting, observer position at the company by a new three-member initial board.","Microsoft’s partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI is under US and UK antitrust scrutiny, the British regulator and a media report said on Friday, following the startup’s boardroom battle that led to the sudden ouster and return of CEO Sam Altman.
After the dramatic episode last month, Microsoft, a major OpenAI backer, was granted a non-voting, observer position at the company by a new three-member initial board. Microsoft’s representative can attend OpenAI’s board meetings and access confidential information, but cannot vote on matters including electing or choosing directors.
The companies have not revealed who from Microsoft will take the non-voting position and what a final OpenAI board would look like.

OpenAI’s parent is a non-profit company, a type of entity rarely subject to antitrust scrutiny. In 2019 it set up a for-profit subsidiary, in which Microsoft owns a 49% stake, according to a source. But a Microsoft spokesperson disputed that on Friday, saying details of its agreement were confidential, that it does not “own any portion” of OpenAI, and is entitled to a share of profits.
The software giant has committed to pumping more than $10 billion into the startup, allowing it to take the lead in a race for AI revenue with Alphabet’s Google.”There have recently been a number of developments in the governance of OpenAI, some of which involved Microsoft,” the UK Competition and Markets Authority said on Friday.
The CMA is reviewing whether to launch a probe into Microsoft’s investment to see if it could hurt UK competition.
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is also examining whether the investment could have violated antitrust laws, Bloomberg News reported, adding that the inquiries were preliminary and the agency has not opened a formal investigation.
ADVERTISEMENT
The FTC declined to comment. Microsoft President Brad Smith said in statement that “the only thing that has changed is that Microsoft will now have a non-voting observer on OpenAI’s board.”
“(That) is very different from an acquisition such as Google’s purchase of DeepMindin the UK,” he added, citing the deal by its main rival in 2014.
MOVE QUICKLY
Other regulatory probes could follow given the growing concentration in AI, said Max von Thun, Europe director at Open Markets Institute, a non-profit organisation focused on strengthening antitrust law.
“It is essential that antitrust authorities move quickly to investigate these deals, including unwinding them if necessary, to preserve competition and prevent this critical emerging technology from being monopolized.”
ADVERTISEMENT
European Union antitrust regulators said they have been following “very closely the situation of control.”
Britain’s CMA has invited interested parties such as Google to comment on the review by Jan. 3, 2024.
The CMA will need to find evidence that the recent fall-out from the Altman affair has led to material changes in the governance of OpenAI and Microsoft’s influence over its affairs, said Alex Haffner, competition lawyer and partner at Fladgate.
Even if it does not pursue a full probe, the preliminary investigation will better inform the CMA’s broader oversight of the fast-developing AI sector, he said.

The accord requires foundation models such as ChatGPT and general purpose AI systems (GPAI) to comply with transparency obligations before they are put on the market. These include drawing up technical documentation, complying with EU copyright law and disseminating detailed summaries about the content used for training.
High-impact foundation models with systemic risk will have to conduct model evaluations, assess and mitigate systemic risks, conduct adversarial testing, report to the European Commission on serious incidents, ensure cybersecurity and report on their energy efficiency.
GPAIs with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice to comply with the new regulation.

Governments can only use real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces in cases of victims of certain crimes, prevention of genuine, present, or foreseeable threats, such as terrorist attacks, and searches for people suspected of the most serious crimes.
The agreement bans cognitive behavioural manipulation, the untargeted scrapping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage, social scoring and biometric categorisation systems to infer political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation and race.
Consumers would have the right to launch complaints and receive meaningful explanations while fines for violations would range from 7.5 million euros ($8.1 million) or 1.5% of turnover to 35 million euros or 7% of global turnover.
Business group DigitalEurope criticised the rules as yet another burden for companies, on top of other recent legislation.

“We have a deal, but at what cost? We fully supported a risk-based approach based on the uses of AI, not the technology itself, but the last-minute attempt to regulate foundation models has turned this on its head,” its Director General Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl said.
Privacy rights group European Digital Rights was equally critical.”It’s hard to be excited about a law which has, for the first time in the EU, taken steps to legalise live public facial recognition across the bloc,” its senior policy advisor Ella Jakubowska said.”
Whilst the Parliament fought hard to limit the damage, the overall package on biometric surveillance and profiling is at best lukewarm.”The legislation is expected to enter into force early next year once both sides formally ratify it and should apply two years after that.
Governments around the world are seeking to balance the advantages of the technology, which can engage in human-like conversations, answer questions and write computer code, against the need to put guardrails in place.

Scientists reveal physics behind stars’ unusual ‘superflares’,"Scientists have used computer models to understand how ""super flares"" on brighter stars than the Sun work.","Although it may look like a static ball of fire in the sky from our perspective, the Sun is very active and produces solar flares that can impact our planet. The strongest of these flares have the capacity to cause blackouts and disrupt communications on a global scale.
While solar flares are powerful by themselves, they are nothing compared to thousands of “superflares” that are observed by NASA’s Kepler and TESS missions. These superflares are produced by stars that are 100 to 10,000 times brighter than the Sun.
The physics is believed to be the same between the solar flares on our sun and the superflares on other planets — they are sudden releases of magnetic energy, But since the super-flaring stars have stronger magnetic fields, they have brighter flares. But the superflares have some unusual behaviorus— they have in initial short-lived enhancement followed by a secondary longer-duration but less intense flare.
ADVERTISEMENT
Scientists developed a model to explain the phenomenon, which was published in a paper in The Astrophysical Journal on Wednesday.
It was thought that the visible light in these flares only came from the lower layers of a star’s atmosphere. Particles that are energised by “magnetic reconnection” fall down from the hot corona (outer layer of the star) and heat these layers. But recent work put forward the hypothesis that the emission from coronal loops may also be detected for super-flaring stars but that their density in these loops would need to be extremely high for that.
Unfortunately, there was no real way to test this since we cannot really see those loops—hot plasma trapped by a star’s magnetic field—on stars other than our Sun. But other astronomers who were not part of the study spotted stars that had a peculiar light curve which was similar to a celestial “peak-bump,” or a jump in brightness. As it turned out, this light curve bore a resemblance to a solar phenomenon where a second more gradual peak follows the initial burst. It reminded the astronomers of a phenomenon on the Sun called late-phase flares.
This prompted the question — could the same process produce similar late-phase brightness in visible light? The researchers answered that by adapting fluid simulations that had been frequently used to simulate solar flare loops and scaled up the loop length and magnetic energy.

WhatsApp now lets users send voice messages as View Once,You will soon be able to send and receive view once audio messages on WhatsApp.,"WhatsApp on Friday announced that it will begin allowing users to send voice messages that will disappear once they are listened to. View once has already been a feature for photos and videos since 2021 and the instant messaging platform hopes bringing it to audio messages will add another layer of privacy to your messages.
In theory, this means that if you are reading out credit card details to a friend or if you are sharing sensitive information over voice messages with a friend, you have a little more peace of mind. Not that we recommend doing either of those things. View once audio messages will be consistent with view once photos and videos and will clearly be marked with the “one-time” icon and can only be played one time.

How to use Google’s new Gemini AI on Bard and Pixel 8 Pro,Want to try Google's new Gemini AI model? Here's how you can do it on Bard.,"With the Google Gemini announcement Wednesday, Google finally looks like it’s got a shot against OpenAI’s insanely popular ChatGPT. While the company did launch Bard earlier this year, it’s been something of an afterthought and its conversational skills trail well behind ChatGPT. That looks to be changing with Bard’s Gemini update that Google says brings more advanced reasoning, planning, and understanding. But Bard is not the only way you can use Gemini.
If you want to give the model a shot, you can try it out for free in two ways: either through Google’s Bard AI chatbot or through a couple of features on the Pixel 8 Pro. Let’s take a look at how.

"7 things you need to know about Gemini, Google’s rival to OpenAI’s GPT",Google seems all set to take on ChatGPT with Gemini..properly this time. Here’s everything you need to know about the company’s smartest AI model to date.,"2023 was a surprising year for AI – the company long considered as the AI top dog lost at its own game to a startup unheard of by many before its meteoric rise. Caught off guard, Google scrambled to catch up with its own AI chatbot offering in the form of Bard, but that was proved unremarkable by users, at least when compared to others in the race.
Now the search engine giant looks geared to dethrone OpenAI with a fresh start – a new family of AI models called Gemini that’s seemingly built from the ground up. And if Google’s own comparisons are to be believed, the AI model does seem to outperform GPT-4 across multiple parameters, particularly the multimodal ones. The company has already plugged bits of it into the Pixel 8 Pro and Bard, but that’s just a start. Below, we’ve compiled everything Google has in store with ChatGPT’s biggest possible threat.

Webb captures ‘hamburger’ that is first detailed picture of ice in planet-forming disc,This James Webb Space Telescope image looks like hamburger because of some of the special properties of the planet forming disc in it.,"Astronomers have created what could be the first two-dimensional ice inventory of a “protoplanetary disc” of dust and gas that surrounds a young star. They used the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the planet-forming disc and published their findings in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics on Wednesday.
Ice is essential in the formation of planets and comets. Solid dust particles clump together into larger chunks because of ice. This is what forms planets and comets. Also, scientists believe that impacts from icy comets played an important role in contributing to the amount of water on our planet. Ice may also contain atoms of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, which are considered to be the building blocks of life.

"Governments spying on Apple, Google users through push notifications -US senator","Most users give push notifications little thought, but they have occasionally attracted attention from technologists because of the difficulty of deploying them without sending data to Google or Apple.","Unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users via their apps’ push notifications, a U.S. senator warned on Wednesday.
In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from Alphabet’s Google and Apple. Although details were sparse, the letter lays out yet another path by which governments can track smartphones.
Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible “dings” or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple’s servers.
ADVERTISEMENT
That gives the two companies unique insight into the traffic flowing from those apps to their users, and in turn puts them “in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps,” Wyden said. He asked the Department of Justice to “repeal or modify any policies” that hindered public discussions of push notification spying.
In a statement, Apple said that Wyden’s letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications.
“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,” the company said in a statement. “Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.”
The Department of Justice did not return messages seeking comment on the push notification surveillance or whether it had prevented Apple of Google from talking about it. Google did not return messages seeking comment.
ADVERTISEMENT
Wyden’s letter cited a “tip” as the source of the information about the surveillance. His staff did not elaborate on the tip, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed that both foreign and U.S. government agencies have been asking Apple and Google for metadata related to push notifications to, for example, help tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts.
The source declined to identify the foreign governments involved in making the requests but described them as democracies allied to the United States.
The source said they did not know how long such information had been gathered in that way.
Most users give push notifications little thought, but they have occasionally attracted attention from technologists because of the difficulty of deploying them without sending data to Google or Apple.
ADVERTISEMENT
Earlier this year French developer David Libeau said users and developers were often unaware of how their apps emitted data to the U.S. tech giants via push notifications, calling them “a privacy nightmare.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/government-spying-apple-google-9057265/,technology

It was written and recorded by Bustos using artificial intelligence to modify Bad Bunny's vocals, producing a viral track that prompted parodies and copycat versions on TikTok.","Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny’s voice quickly went viral last month. However, the songs circulating did not belong to him.
Chilean artist Maurico Bustos launched the trend with the song NostalgIA – a play on the Spanish abbreviation for AI. It was written and recorded by Bustos using artificial intelligence to modify Bad Bunny’s vocals, producing a viral track that prompted parodies and copycat versions on TikTok.
Bad Bunny told his 20 million WhatsApp followers to leave if they liked “this shitty song that is viral on TikTok … I don’t want you on tour either.”

The 30-year-old Bustos, known as FlowGPT, sent a response as the AI entity saying he was a fan of Bad Bunny’s work and noting that his success was partly thanks to the artists he has learned from.

“I was built to be the best artist in the world and I will carry on experimenting until I achieve it,” he said. “Don’t worry, you’ll still be the No. 1 human.”
Bustos, who has already released FlowGPT tracks based on Colombian reggaeton artist Feid and Puerto Rican rapper Anuel, told Reuters he wants to create a fictional virtual character like British band Gorillaz, but using AI.
Claudia Gutierrez, a consultant on AI issues, said due to a legal void, this trending type of generative AI will be difficult to clamp down on.

“FlowGPT isn’t worried because even though Bad Bunny got angry because his voice tone was used, he knows there is a legal void and so he cannot be sued,” Gutierrez said.

The company has raised $134.7 million in equity financing from a total offering amount of $1 billion, the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.
Fundraising for AI remains a bright spot for startups this year, following OpenAI’s launch of popular chatbot ChatGPT last year and raising of $10 billion from its strategic backer Microsoft Corp. Regulators, however, are concerned about the potential use of the technology to spread misinformation.

Musk has been vocal about his plans to build safer AI. In a Twitter Spaces event earlier in the year he said that rather than explicitly programming morality into its AI, xAI will seek to create a “maximally curious” AI.

GTA 6 trailer shows a modern Bonnie and Clyde in virtual Miami,"Here is everything we know about GTA 6, the latest iteration in Rockstar Games' superhit Grand Theft Auto series.","It is almost here.

Apple warns India’s EU-style charger rules will hit local production target,Apple has for years offered a unique lightning connector port on its iPhones.,"Apple has told India its local production targets will be hit if New Delhi follows the European Union and requires existing iPhones to have universal charging ports, a government document shows as the U.S. tech giant lobbies for an exemption or delay.
India wants to implement a European Union rule that will require smartphones to have a universal USB-C charging port, and has been in talks with manufacturers about introducing the requirement in India by June 2025, six months after the deadline in the EU. While all manufacturers including Samsung have agreed to India’s plan, Apple is pushing back.
Apple has for years offered a unique lightning connector port on its iPhones. The EU, however, estimates a single charger solution would save about $271 million for consumers, and India has said the move will reduce e-waste and help users.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a closed-door Nov. 28 meeting chaired by India’s IT ministry, Apple asked officials to exempt existing iPhone models from the rules, warning it will otherwise struggle to meet production targets set under India’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, according to the meeting minutes seen by Reuters.
PLI is a key project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and offers electronic manufacturers in India fiscal incentives for fresh investments and incremental phone sales each year. It has been extensively used by Apple suppliers like Foxconn to expand iPhone manufacturing in the country.
“If the regulation is implemented on earlier models of mobile phones, they (Apple) will not be able to meet the PLI targets,” the minutes quoted Apple’s regulatory and product compliance executives as saying while opposing the rules.
Apple did not quantify the production impact in the meeting, and the IT ministry decided to review its request and reach a decision later, two people familiar with the discussions said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Apple, whose India lobbying efforts are being reported for the first time, and India’s IT ministry, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Design can’t change
India is seen as Apple’s next growth frontier after China.
Renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has estimated 12-14% of iPhone production in 2023 will be from India, with the number set to rise to as much as 25% next year.
In terms of market share, Apple accounts for 6% of India’s booming smartphone market, compared with just about 2% four years ago. Apple suppliers have expanded their facilities and make most iPhone 12, 13, 14 and 15 models in India for local sales and exports, Counterpoint Research estimates.
ADVERTISEMENT
Only iPhone 15 has the new universal charging port. Apple told Indian officials in the meeting that the “design of the earlier products cannot be changed,” the document showed.
Consumers in India’s price-conscious market prefer buying older models of iPhones which typically become cheaper with new launches, and India’s push for the common charger on older models could hit Apple’s targets, said Prabhu Ram, head of the Industry Intelligence Group at CyberMedia Research.
“Apple’s fortunes in India have primarily been tied to older generation iPhones,” he said.
The EU’s charging port rules kick in in December 2024, and India wants compliance by June 2025.
ADVERTISEMENT
Apple told officials it can comply with that timeline if existing models are exempted from the rules, but will need 18 months beyond 2024 if they are not.
“A natural transition period should be given … keeping in mind the product design timelines,” the minutes quoted Apple executives as telling government officials.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-warns-india-iphone-production-9055603/,technology

Speaking to CNBC on  Meta’s 10th anniversary of the Fundamental AI research team, LeCun expressed his scepticism about artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the current state of quantum computing.
He believes that we will most likely get ‘car-level’ or ‘dog-level’ AI before reaching human capabilities. LeCun’s statement are in stark contrast to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s claims that AI will be ‘fairly competitive’ with humans in the next five years.

AI could judge if user is of porn-watching age under new UK guidance,"On average children first see online pornography at 13, while nearly a quarter come across it by age 11, and one in 10 as young as 9, a 2021-2022 study by the Office of the Children's Commissioner for England showed.","Britain proposed new age-check guidance on Tuesday to protect children from accessing pornography online, including a suggestion to use AI-based technology to see if a viewer looks to be of legal age.
The government’s newly passed Online Safety Act requires sites and apps that display or publish pornographic content to ensure that children are not normally able to encounter pornography on their service. The legal age to watch porn in Britain is 18 or over.

“Regardless of their approach, we expect all services to offer robust protection to children from stumbling across pornography, and also to take care that privacy rights and freedoms for adults to access legal content are safeguarded,” media regulator Ofcom CEO Melanie Dawes said.

The regulator described its suggestion on facial age estimation as using AI to analyse a viewer’s features. That would likely require taking a selfie on a device and uploading it.
The watchdog said its proposed guidance also included photo identification matching, requiring a user to upload a photo ID such as passport or driving licence to prove their age, and credit chard checks.
Another suggestion was open banking, whereby users can consent to their bank sharing information with online porn sites to confirm they are over 18.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Institute of Economic Affairs, a free-market think tank, said mandatory age verification threatened user privacy and would expose users to breaches and abuse by increasing the amount of sensitive data held by third parties.
The regulator said weaker methods such as self-declaration of age, online payment methods that do not require a person to be 18, and disclaimers or warnings, would no longer meet the standards in its new guidance.

5 tips and tricks to fix the most annoying things about your wireless earbuds,"Compared to wired earphones, wireless earbuds are a lot more practical. However, they also bring their own set of issues and here are some solutions to fix them.","Truly wireless earbuds (TWS) may be the most popular form of wireless earphones on the market, but they too have their fair share of problems. In fact, wireless earbuds can act strangely at times, from being unable to pair with a device to distorted noise, making it difficult to use the earbuds. Here are five of the most occurring issues with wireless earbuds, along with quick and simple resolutions to overcome those hurdles.
Unable to pair TWS
This issue could arise due to several reasons, and both TWS and the smartphone could be at fault. One of the best troubleshooting tips for this issue is to ensure that the phone and the earbuds are not paired to another device, as most phones and wireless earphones can only connect to a single device at once. Also, make sure that Bluetooth on your phone is enabled. Some smartphones automatically disable Bluetooth pairing mode when not in use to reduce power consumption, and one has to manually re-enable Bluetooth to pair a new device.

"What is Suika, the Nintendo Switch game everyone’s talking about","The Japanese Suika game, also known as the Watermelon Game, is a score-based puzzle game that has taken the internet by storm. The game is available on Nintendo Switch.","2023 proved to be a blockbuster year for games. While big AAA titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of Kingdom, Baldur’s Gate 3, and Hogwarts Legacy topped the charts worldwide, there’s one game in particular that emerged seemingly out of nowhere and became everyone’s favourite. We are talking about the Suika game, also known as the Watermelon game, which has had over 4.4 million downloads since its release in October. The goofy puzzle game has taken the internet by storm, thanks to streamers and Vtubers worldwide. In fact, this little game has become one of Nintendo’s most downloaded games this year. It makes us wonder how a puzzle game that many people hadn’t heard of until recently managed to shatter records in such a short time when every big-ticket game is battling for everyone’s attention in a crowded release calendar.

Apple reportedly developing in-house 6G modem for future iPhone models,"Apple is looking for talent, who can develop prototypes and conduct tests on 6G technology candidates.","Apple has been working on an in-house 5G modem for a while; however, the company hasn’t found much success and is currently dependent on Qualcomm for the 5G modem for iPhones and iPads. As the company continues to develop an in-house 5G model, a report by Bloomberg suggests that the company is also working on an in-house 6G modem.
According to the PowerOn newsletter by Mark Gurman, the company has been working on a 6G modem since 2021. Given that 6G will not be a reality until at least 2030, it gives Apple plenty of time to develop, test, and optimise in-house 6G technology. This will not only make Apple self-reliant but will also give more control over the hardware, along with financial benefits in the long run.

Watch this space: Humans want to go to the Moon again and never leave,NASA is back with the Artemis programme to put humanity back on the Moon.,"NASA had initially planned for the Artemis 3 mission to land humans on the Moon in 2025, around 52 years after the last Apollo mission landed astronauts in 1952. But now, the United States Government Accountability Office says the space agency will not be able to do that until 2027 at the earliest. But why does NASA want to send astronauts to the Moon again when it has already proven that it can do that more than half a century ago? 
If you share that sentiment, you are not in poor company. Former American president Barack Obama felt the same. During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in 2010, he turned NASA’s attention away from the Moon and towards Mars and deep space asteroids. “I just have to say pretty bluntly here: We’ve been there before. There’s a lot more of space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.”

Rockrider E-ST100 review: A bike first and e-bike later… that’s the advantage,"Decathlon's Rockrider E-ST100 is a large but compact e-bike, not much larger than a regular cycle, except for the 380 Wh Samsung Li-Ion battery pack in the main frame.","“Sir, there is no accelerator on this bike.” My intrigue about Decathlon’s Rockrider E-ST100 started the moment it was delivered. I have checked out a few e-bikes in the past couple of years, but how does an e-bike work when it does not have an accelerator? This was going to be one interesting review.
The Rockrider E-ST100 is a large but compact e-bike, not much larger than a regular cycle, except for the 380 Wh Samsung Li-Ion battery pack in the main frame. You will also notice the 250W Rear Hub Motor with 42 Nm torque, which you would not find on regular cycles. There is a small LCD panel on the left handle bar which lets you switch on the assist modes and also shows how much distance you have travelled as well as your speed. This is pretty much the only real indicator that this is an e-bike.

Generative AI will not increase India Inc’s IT spendings till 2025: Gartner,Gartner predict that generative AI will not have a significant effect on Indian corporations' IT spends till 2025.,"You would be forgiven for being led to believe that generative AI will change the world and it will do so right now. As it turns out, the world of Indian corporate IT spending will not be significantly changed by the groundbreaking technology, at least until 2025, according to Gartner.
But despite that, the Indian IT spending forecast looks quite rosy. Overall IT spending had shrunk by 0.5 per cent between 2022 and 2023, attributed to inflation pressure. The increasing adoption of digital technologies in the country will call for greater implementation of cloud services and IT services. This should mean that corporate spending on IT infrastructure is set to increase by 10.7 per cent in 2024, according to consultancy firm Gartner.

Now let’s take a look at how things could change once this standard evolves into 5G-enabled VoNR.,"Remember when VoLTE (Voice over Long-Term Evolution) first hit the scene in India back in 2016? Folks were finally able to chat in crystal clear WhatsApp-quality voice on calls without having to utter “What?!” every few minutes because the other person sounded muffled.

But now that 5G has landed in India and seeing as VoLTE is tied to 4G systems, tech enthusiasts are itching for a new calling standard to match the next-gen speeds. Enter Vo5G (Voice over 5G), which has already been deployed in several countries globally. In this piece, we’ll break down what exactly Vo5G is, the advantages it brings to the table compared to VoLTE, and when we can expect it to come to India.

"Hubble Space Telescope is in safe mode, NASA pauses operations",NASA said that it is working on getting the Hubble Space Telescope up and running after it went into safe mode due to a malfunctioning gyroscope.,"NASA said on Wednesday that it is working on restarting the Hubble Space Telescope’s science operations after it entered safe mode because of an issue with its gyroscope. The telescope’s instruments are stable and it is otherwise in good health.
Hubble automatically entered safe mode on November 23 when one of its three gyroscopes gave faulty readings. Those three gyroscopes measure its turn rates and are crucial to a system that makes sure the telescope is pointed in the right direction. Science operations are paused while in safe mode as the telescope now waits for new directions. But that was not the first time it went into safe mode.

"‘Felt hurt and angry’, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman opens up about the 5-day boardroom drama",Sam Altman has finally broken his silence on all that transpired following his sacking by the OpenAI board.,"On November 17, the tech world was shaken by the unceremonious sacking of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman by the board. The ouster led to nearly five days of drama until Altman was reinstated as the CEO of the company.

In an interview with The Verge, Altman admitted he initially felt defiant, hurt and angry. When asked about his reaction to being reinstated as the company CEO, Altman said that it took him a few minutes to snap out of it and get over the ego and emotions to finally embrace the change.

Google’s Head of Trust and Safety for Asia Pacific explains why it took time to rein in bad loan apps,"Saikat Mitra, Vice President and Head of Trust and Safety for Asia-Pacific at Google explains why the company finds it difficult to control bad loan apps.","“The reason it took us a while to handle loan apps was that they were not putting malware on people’s phones, nor did they have harmful content on the app. Instead, there were bad business practices that occurred in the real world,” explains Saikat Mitra, Vice President and Head of Trust and Safety for Asia-Pacific at Google. He notes that figuring out “bad business practices” is the most difficult part when the company approves an app.
Mitra says when developers submit an app and want to get listed on the Google Play Store, it’s a long process. The company rejects an app at the code level if it is found suspicious, but it also looks at other aspects like content safety. “There are probably a few different ways of looking at it: does this app have malware? Is it going to steal my data? Is it going to block my keystrokes? We actually feel very good about that, and that’s something we’ve invested tremendously over the years,” Mitra explained to indianexpress.com in an interview.

"Microsoft to take non-voting, observer position on OpenAI’s board","The observer position means Microsoft's representative can attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information, but it does not have voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.","Microsoft will take a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI’s board, CEO Sam Altman said in his first official missive after taking back the reins of the company on Wednesday.
The observer position means Microsoft’s representative can attend OpenAI’s board meetings and access confidential information, but it does not have voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who had recruited Altman to Microsoft after his ouster from OpenAI, had said earlier that governance at the ChatGPT maker needs to change.

OpenAI announced a new initial board last week that consists of former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor as chair and Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary. Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, who was part of the board who fired Altman, also stayed on for the new one.

Taylor on Wednesday said on X, formerly Twitter, that he intended to “step away and leave the oversight of OpenAI in the good hands of board colleagues” when transitional tasks have been completed.
The new OpenAI board is on an active search for new members with expertise in fields from technology to safety and policy. OpenAI investors are unlikely to get a seat on the non-profit board, sources told Reuters.
Microsoft has committed to invest over $10 billion into OpenAI and owns 49% of the company. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mira Murati, who had been OpenAI’s chief technology officer and was briefly named interim CEO after Altman’s ouster, is once again the company’s CTO.
OpenAI ousted Altman on Nov. 17 without any detailed cause, setting off alarm bells among investors and employees. He was reinstated four days later with the promise of a new board.
Altman’s exit sparked confusion about the future of the startup at the center of an artificial intelligence boom.
His co-founder Greg Brockman, who had followed Altman out of the company, would return as president, Altman said on Wednesday.

Sutskever had joined in the effort to fire Altman but later signed an employee letter demanding his return, expressing regret for his “participation in the board’s actions.”
“I love and respect Ilya, I think he’s a guiding light of the field and a gem of a human being. I harbor zero ill will towards him,” Altman said, adding the company was discussing how Sutskever could continue his work at OpenAI.

Elon Musk curses out advertisers who left X over antisemitic content,"The Tesla CEO bristled at the idea that he was antisemitic and said that advertisers who left X, formerly known as Twitter, should not think they could blackmail him.","Billionaire Elon Musk told advertisers that have fled his social media platform X over antisemitic content to “Go fuck yourself” in a fiery Wednesday interview.
His profanity-laced remarks followed a moment of contrition in a New York Times DealBook Summit interview. Musk said repeatedly he was sorry for publishing a tweet on Nov. 15 that agreed with an anti-Jewish post. Musk has faced a torrent of criticism ever since he agreed with a user who falsely claimed Jewish people were stoking hatred against white people. Musk in his post said the user, who referenced the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, was speaking “the actual truth.”
On Wednesday Musk said he had “handed a loaded gun” to both detractors and antisemitic people, describing his post as possibly the worst he had made during a history of messages that included many “foolish” ones.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Tesla CEO bristled at the idea that he was antisemitic and said that advertisers who left X, formerly known as Twitter, should not think they could blackmail him.
“If somebody’s gonna try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money? Go fuck yourself,” he said.

“Go. Fuck. Yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is. Hey, Bob, if you’re in the audience,” he added, in an apparent reference to Robert Iger, chief executive of Walt Disney, which pulled ads on X. Iger spoke earlier at the event and said that Disney felt the association with X following Musk’s move “was not a positive one for us”. A spokesperson from Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“What I care about is the reality of goodness, not the perception of it. And what I see all over the place is people who care about looking good while doing evil. Fuck them,” Musk said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Musk’s expletives against advertisers is the “closing chapter” for brands doing business with X, said Lou Paskalis, founder of marketing consultancy AJL Advisory and the former head of global media at Bank of America. “They’re not going to forget that,” he said.
Customers who did not like him should consider the products his company make based on their quality, Musk said, pointing to electric cars from Tesla and SpaceX rockets. “I will certainly not pander,” he said.
Musk added that he himself arguably had done more for the environment, at Tesla, than anyone in the world, based on Tesla’s massive sales of electric vehicles.
“It would be fair to say, therefore, as a leader of the company, I’ve done more for the environment than everyone — any single human on Earth.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Musk’s comments came on the same day that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned that the rise in antisemitism since the start of the Israel-Hamas war has reached a crisis point, saying it threatens the safety of Jews worldwide and the future of Israel. “To us, the Jewish people, the rise in antisemitism is a crisis. A five-alarm fire that must be extinguished,” Schumer said in an emotional, 40-minute Senate speech.
Musk’s post drew condemnation from the White House for what it called an “abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate.”
The “Great Replacement” theory falsely claims that Jewish people and leftists are engineering the ethnic and cultural replacement of white populations with non-white immigrants that will lead to a “white genocide.”
Following the post, major U.S. companies including Walt Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and NBCUniversal parent Comcast suspended their ads on X. A report from liberal watchdog group Media Matters precipitated the advertiser exit, which said it found ads next to posts that supported Nazism. The platform filed a lawsuit last week against Media Matters for defamation.
ADVERTISEMENT
Musk’s comments have put pressure on X overall, including Chief Executive Linda Yaccarino. An executive told Reuters that she would remain at the company.
Musk himself appeared resolved that X could fail financially and blamed advertisers.
“If the company fails because of advertiser boycott, it will fail because of an advertiser boycott. And that will be what bankrupt the company and that’s what everybody on earth will know,” he said. “Let the chips fall where they may.”
In the wake of the condemnation around his post, Musk traveled to Israel and toured the site of Hamas’ assault in the country on Oct. 7. On Monday, he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a live-streamed conversation on X.

"ChatGPT celebrates 1st anniversary: A look at pathbreaking features, controversies, and more","ChatGPT, an AI breakthrough by OpenAI, is celebrating its first anniversary. Here’s a look at its rapid adoption, innovations, controversies, and global impact.","The year 2023 has been eventful for tech enthusiasts, with the biggest breakthrough being in artificial intelligence. Although research around AI has been ongoing for several decades, it wasn’t until 2022 that it entered the public consciousness, primarily when San Francisco-based AI startup OpenAI introduced its AI chatbot. The date, November 30, 2022, marks a seminal moment in modern AI developments, as ChatGPT was officially launched by OpenAI.
The launch of this chatbot, capable of answering questions on virtually any topic, was deemed one of mankind’s most marvellous creations. Similar to the internet or the microprocessor, any new technology is initially met with denial, some fear, and eventual acceptance. The AI chatbot too had its share of wins and defeats. ChatGPT, or Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was built on GPT-3.5, OpenAI’s proprietary language model. The chatbot was initially released as a freely available research preview. The creation of ChatGPT involved a large team of researchers and engineers who worked together for several years.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-turns-one-a-timeline-9047796/,technology

YouTube users have to disclose altered content that looks realistic: Google,"""YouTube will require creators to disclose altered or synthetic content, including using AI tools, and we'll inform viewers about such content,"" said Google.","In a bid to tighten norms to tackle deepfakes, Google on Wednesday said content creators on YouTube will have to disclose any altered or synthetic content that they post on the platform.
Google said it will enable the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic or altered content on YouTube that simulates an identifiable individual, including their face or voice, using its privacy request process.
“In the coming months, YouTube will require creators to disclose altered or synthetic content that is realistic, including using AI tools, and we’ll inform viewers about such content through labels in the description panel and video player.

The development comes within a week of Union cabinet minister for electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw and minister of state for electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar directing social media platforms to strictly act against deepfakes. Vaishnaw had said that the government will come out with new guidelines to fight deepfakes and Chandrasekhar had asked social media firms to update their user policy as per the IT rules notified in October 2022.
Google said that there is no silver bullet to combat deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation. “It requires a collaborative effort, one that involves open communication, rigorous risk assessment, and proactive mitigation strategies… Our collaboration with the Indian government for a multi-stakeholder discussion aligns with our commitment to addressing this challenge together and ensuring a responsible approach to AI,” Google said. Google said it has invested USD 1 million in grants to the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, to establish the first of its kind multidisciplinary center for Responsible AI.
The center will foster collective effort — involving not just researchers, but domain experts, developers, community members, policy makers and more – in getting AI right, and localizing it to the Indian context.
The government sprung into action after several celebrities reported about their deepfake images and videos in circulation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also flagged issues around deepfakes.

Happinetz Box review: An armor to protect your kids online,The Happinetz Box connects to a home Wi-Fi router and monitors your child’s online activities.,"Over the weekend, while I was having lunch, my mother came to me and narrated an incident that recently occurred in our society. A kid accidentally ordered cakes at 4 am from a food online ordering app when the parents were asleep. This didn’t happen just once but twice in a span of two days. Eventually, the parents had to lock their smartphone so that the kid would not get access to the app. This made me realise how kids and teens are the most vulnerable in cyberspace. While policymakers need to regulate social media and other technology for children and teenagers, the onus is also on the parents to emphasise digital literacy and privacy. However, surveillance or banning may not be the answer.
This brings me to Happinetz, a device that connects to a home Wi-Fi router and monitors your child’s online activities. I won’t say it is the only parental control solution for online monitoring, but it is definitely a good alternative if you are ready to pay Rs 4,999.

Amazon’s palm-scanning tech expands beyond payments: How it works,"Amazon's palm scanning technology was launched for receptionist-less payments. Now, it's being repackaged for authentication in corporate offices.","Amazon is taking its palm-scanning technology out of the grocery aisle and into the workplace. The tech giant is rolling out Amazon One Enterprise, a version of its palm-reading biometric system designed for corporate offices rather than supermarkets. With One Enterprise, employees can wave their palm over a scanner to gain access to buildings, computers, and sensitive data.
Several major corporations have already signed on to pilot the technology, including hotel group IHG, turnstile maker Boon Edam, and elevator company Kone. Amazon says palm scanning is cheaper, more convenient, and more secure than conventional ID badges, keycards, or passwords. But how does it work and what are its implications? Let’s take a look.

"Yuval Noah Harari feels AI could lead to ‘catastrophic’ financial crisis, may indirectly trigger war",The Israeli author said that AI could lead to a financial crisis adding that it could lead to problems much beyond human comprehension.,"Slowly but steadily, it seems, we are inching towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). With each passing day, we are witnessing newer capabilities, and also some that could spell trouble for mankind. Now, it seems AI could lead to a ‘Catastrophic financial crisis’. Acclaimed author Yuval Noah Harari in his recent interview said that the sophistication of the technology makes it difficult to predict its dangers. 
The 47-year-old author of ‘Sapiens: A brief history of Humankind’ and ‘Homo Deus: A brief history of Tomorrow’ in an interview with The Guardian outlined the catastrophic consequences of AI on the financial system. It is to be noted that the author had painted a grim picture of the AI age and advocated for the need for regulation earlier this year.

Amazon wants to replace desktops in offices with this inexpensive ‘thin client’,Amazon’s new $195 thin client built into Fire TV Cube hardware is here to streamline your virtual office.,"Amazon is bringing its signature low-cost, high-efficiency business model to the virtual office world with the launch of a $195 thin client built right into Fire TV Cube hardware. While it may look exactly like the model sitting next to your TV, this cube has its sights set on enterprise solutions rather than home entertainment.

AI threat demands new approach to security designs,Leading AI developers have agreed to work with governments to test new frontier models before they are released to help manage the risks of the rapidly developing technology.,"The potential threat posed by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) means safeguards need to be built in to systems from the start rather than tacked on later, a top U.S. official said on Monday.
“We’ve normalized a world where technology products come off the line full of vulnerabilities and then consumers are expected to patch those vulnerabilities. We can’t live in that world with AI,” said Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
“It is too powerful, it is moving too fast,” she said in a telephone interview after holding talks in Ottawa with Sami Khoury, head of Canada’s Centre for Cyber Security.

Easterly spoke the same day that agencies from 18 countries, including the United States, endorsed new British-developed guidelines on AI cyber security that focus on secure design, development, deployment and maintenance.

“We have to look at security throughout the lifecycle of that AI capability,” Khoury said.
Earlier this month, leading AI developers agreed to work with governments to test new frontier models before they are released to help manage the risks of the rapidly developing technology.
“I think we have done as much as we possibly could do at this point in time, to help come together with nations around the world, with technology companies, to set out from a technical perspective how to build these build these capabilities as securely and safely as possible,” said Easterly.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-threat-demands-new-approach-to-security-designs-9045121/,technology

iPhone 16 and 16 Pro: Everything you need to know,"iPhone 16 series might look similar to their predecessors, but they are said to pack some new software based capabilities.","Although the iPhone 15 series went on sale a few months ago, there are already rumours about the next-generation iPhone 16 lineup. There are still months left until the launch of Apple’s iPhone 16, but leaks and rumours have started making their way about the new device. The baseline iPhone 15 and high-end iPhone 15 Pro offered tweaks here and there, such as in the camera and design, but experts believe that Apple is all set to take some bold steps and bring something radically different with the upcoming iPhone 16 series.
So, what will the iPhone 16 bring, and are the upgrades worth the hype? Here’s all that we know:
iPhone 16, 16 Plus likely to feature 60Hz displays
According to a report by industry insider Ross Young, Apple is likely to limit the high-refresh-rate 120Hz ProMotion display to the Pro lineup in the iPhone 16 series, while the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus are reported to feature a 60Hz panel with a pill-shaped cutout for the dynamic island, similar to the one on the iPhone 15. Like every year, Apple is expected to include a slightly better screen that’s more colour-accurate with a higher brightness level.
ADVERTISEMENT
As one might expect, Apple will continue to stick to the same formula of launching at least four models in the iPhone 16 lineup, including the baseline iPhone 16 with a 6.1-inch display and the 16 Plus with a 6.7-inch screen. However, the Pro models might look a bit different, where, according to the leaker u/Redditor on Reddit, the iPhone 16 Pro is said to include a 6.3-inch screen, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an even bigger 6.9-inch screen, the largest screen that we have seen on an iPhone. The same report suggests that Apple will add the new 5x periscope zoom lens, also known as “tetra-prism,” to the iPhone 16 Pro.
Considering the upgrades, we could again witness a price hike in the Pro lineup, at least in India. The bigger screens also mean bigger batteries and enhanced battery life.
No major design upgrade
According to Mark Gurman’s newsletter, Power On, on Bloomberg, the iPhone 16 series hardware won’t have any major improvements. Instead, the company will be focusing more on the software part. As per the report, the upcoming iOS 18 is expected to include new generative-AI-backed features, similar to apps like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot. Out-of-the-box, the iPhone 16 series will ship with iOS 18, which will be first showcased at the upcoming WWDC 2024.
This indicates that the iPhone 16 series might feature a new and powerful chip, likely to be called A18 Pro, specially designed to handle generative AI tasks with a more powerful NPU, especially on the Pro models, while the baseline variants might feature a toned-down version of the A17 Pro, which currently powers the iPhone 15 Pro series. Hence, the entire lineup of the iPhone 16 series should be able to handle AAA console-quality titles, similar to the iPhone 15 Pro series.

While there has been talk about Apple replacing clickable buttons with solid-state technology for a while, the iPhone 16 Pro series could be the first to embrace the same. Similarly, the all-new action button introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro series might be coming to all four variants of the iPhone 16 lineup. Apple will definitely introduce new color variants to help distinguish between the two generations of iPhones.
iPhone 16 Design Speculation:
– Vertically aligned cameras for spatial video support
– LiDAR scanner for more AR/VR capabilities + better photography
– Action button to replace the mute switch

— Jia (@upintheozone) November 26, 2023
iPhone 16 and 16 Plus could feature a LiDAR sensor
Apple introduced LiDAR, a sensor that measures depth, back in 2020 with the iPhone 12 Pro, and with the iPhone 16 series, the company might introduce the same technology on the base models. A concept of the iPhone 16 featuring a dual-camera setup and a LiDAR sensor has been making rounds on the internet for a while now. This allows users to record 3D or spatial video on their iPhone, and the same feature will soon be made available on the iPhone 15 Pro series with a software update, where users can experience 3D videos on the upcoming Vision Pro.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/iphone-16-features-leaks-speculations-9044438/,technology
"Kobo Libra 2, Clara 2E, Nia review: The eReaders are back, now playing audio books too",The latest Kobo range of eReaders from Rakuten has three models to cater to different audiences.,"Just when I thought e-readers were dead, Rakuten Kobo has come back to India with a series of devices with different price ranges and features to woo the depleting tribe of book lovers. Kobo first entered India in 2013, then a Canadian firm, with four devices. This time it has three eReaders that cater to different types of use cases and users.
Kobo Libra 2 (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/The Indian Express)
Kobo Libra 2
The Kobo Libra 2 is clearly the most premium of the three devices and features a large 7-inch HD screen with backlight, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The device is also waterproof, so you can take it to the pool or even read under the drizzle if you are on a vacation in Kerala.
The Libra 2 has a more square shape with a side bezel that makes it easy to hold with one hand. There are two large buttons on this side for you to flip pages up and down. Now, the device can change orientation to any side, but I preferred locking it with the bezel to the right, the buttons just next to my thumbs.

There is also a power button at the back to wake up the device from sleeping. The USB-C port is on the side of the large bezel.
The 7-inch screen has touch, so you can navigate easily on the screen too. The top of the screen has a panel that gives access to controls and settings. You can adjust brightness here and even make the eReader have a natural hue, which again is adjustable. There is an interesting analytics tab that tells you how long the book will take to finish and other data points which can motivate, or deter, you. The settings also give you access to the WiFi settings as well as Bluetooth, which you can use to connect to an earphone in case you are listening to an audiobook.
Dark mode on the Kobo Libra 2 (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/The Indian Express)
The overall experience of using the Libra 2 was good. The screen is very sharp and it is easy to read under all kinds of lighting. And I loved how this has an easy switch to dark mode in the settings, certainly my preference now across screens. The pages flip smoothly and fast. You can press on a word and get the meaning or even add a note there. You can even search via Google or Wikipedia or inside the book. All these work very well.
The Home button gives you a curation of new books and audiobooks, while the discover tab lets you browse through new titles, curated by genres and based on what you have been reading. My Books tab shows the books you have already purchased and downloaded. There are some Beta features out of which I liked the ability to scribble on the touch screen. You can also browse the web directly from the device, though it is tough given the richness we are used to on Internet screens. I would use this more as an emergency feature.
ADVERTISEMENT
Priced at Rs 19,999, the Kobo Libra 2 is not for everyone, but for those who like a larger screen to read while on the move and for those who like to listen to a lot of audiobooks. It is this convenience you are paying the premium for.
Kobo Clara 2E (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/The Indian Express)
Kobo Clara 2E
The Kobo Clara 2E is a more compact eReader with a 6-inch screen, backlight and Bluetooth connectivity for those who want to listen to audiobooks. Also, the waterproof Clara 2E has been made using recycled plastic, making users feel slightly less guilty.
The Clara 2E is also a bit smaller in footprint than the Libra 2 without losing out on many features. Yes, it does not have the 7-inch HD screen nor does it have the buttons that let you flip pages, but this seems a much more value-to-money product given that it is priced at Rs 5,000 less at Rs 14,999.
Kobo Nia (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/The Indian Express)
Kobo Nia
The Nia is the basic eReader from Kobo with a 6-inch screen and backlight. This does not offer a lot of the features of the other devices, though works pretty well as an eReader, which I think is the only expectation a lot of users have. They are just looking to replace books and this plays that part very well. It offers a good grip and is light enough to be held for hours as you binge on a page-turner. At Rs 10,999, the Nia might be what most users prefer as it ticks most of their requirements.

Kobo eReaders: Setup and titles
The Kobo eReaders are easy to set up, but you will need an account to buy new titles. There is access to millions of titles, though I did not find a very strong India connection in the curations. It would be better if the homepage showed new and interesting Indian titles, and not books by Kalam and Ruskin Bond that get sold more though it is not what book lovers are looking for.
I found some of the pricing a bit odd, especially with the audiobooks. The cheapest audiobook I could find was about Rs 900, and that too some random title. Even some regular books seem to have pricing that has been converted from its Dollar pricing. Kobo will need to think through this aspect if they hope to get more popular.
From Kobo’s re-entry into India, I get the sense that eReaders are now catering more to book lovers who are okay with paying a premium and not really gunning for the mass market. This might work as a strategy though Kobo still needs to compete with Kindle, which Indians consider synonymous with eReaders, with better pricing and selection. At the moment, the Kobo eReaders offer viable options for those who are looking beyond the Kindle. Of the three, the Kobo Clara 2E seems to be the best options for those who want to push their reading to the audiobook genre too.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/kobo-libra-2-clara-2e-nia-review-9044391/,technology

Hyderabad startup behind Hitwicket isn’t taking the traditional route to gaming success,"Hitwicket is a cricket strategy game, and it's played on your smartphone. The popular game has over 5 million downloads across iOS and Android platforms.","When Kashyap Reddy was just 10 years old, he used to draw board games in his notebook. “I would try to get the other kids to come and play the games that I had created, and I would teach them,” Reddy recalls, reflecting on his initial draw to games. As Reddy grew older, he started playing online games such as Football Manager and competed with players globally. Years later, he went on to pursue his ambition of building his own game, the hugely popular mobile cricket game Hitwicket.
“There was a huge opportunity to build something on similar lines as football for cricket, particularly because cricket is even more of a strategic and thinking game,” Reddy told indianexpress.com in an interview. “Cricket is inherently very sticky and engaging,” he said, adding that although the sport is hugely popular in India, no one had earlier attempted to build a game around the concept.

Realme, owned by Chinese consumer hardware giant BBK Electronics which also owns the Oppo and Vivo brands, said it had reached the 200 million mark in the second quarter.
“At realme, we are committed to providing innovative, leap-forward technology that caters to the evolving needs and preferences of our diverse global audience.

"US, Britain, other countries ink agreement to make AI ‘secure by design’","In a 20-page document unveiled Sunday, the 18 countries agreed that companies designing and using AI need to develop and deploy it in a way that keeps customers and the wider public safe from misuse.","The United States, Britain and more than a dozen other countries on Sunday unveiled what a senior U.S. official described as the first detailed international agreement on how to keep artificial intelligence safe from rogue actors, pushing for companies to create AI systems that are “secure by design.”
In a 20-page document unveiled Sunday, the 18 countries agreed that companies designing and using AI need to develop and deploy it in a way that keeps customers and the wider public safe from misuse.
The agreement is non-binding and carries mostly general recommendations such as monitoring AI systems for abuse, protecting data from tampering and vetting software suppliers.
ADVERTISEMENT
Still, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, said it was important that so many countries put their names to the idea that AI systems needed to put safety first.
“This is the first time that we have seen an affirmation that these capabilities should not just be about cool features and how quickly we can get them to market or how we can compete to drive down costs,” Easterly told Reuters, saying the guidelines represent “an agreement that the most important thing that needs to be done at the design phase is security.”
The agreement is the latest in a series of initiatives – few of which carry teeth – by governments around the world to shape the development of AI, whose weight is increasingly being felt in industry and society at large.
In addition to the United States and Britain, the 18 countries that signed on to the new guidelines include Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Australia, Chile, Israel, Nigeria and Singapore.

The framework deals with questions of how to keep AI technology from being hijacked by hackers and includes recommendations such as only releasing models after appropriate security testing.
It does not tackle thorny questions around the appropriate uses of AI, or how the data that feeds these models is gathered.
The rise of AI has fed a host of concerns, including the fear that it could be used to disrupt the democratic process, turbocharge fraud, or lead to dramatic job loss, among other harms.
Europe is ahead of the United States on regulations around AI, with lawmakers there drafting AI rules. France, Germany and Italy also recently reached an agreement on how artificial intelligence should be regulated that supports “mandatory self-regulation through codes of conduct” for so-called foundation models of AI, which are designed to produce a broad range of outputs.

Australian regulator calls for new competition laws for digital platforms,The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in its latest report for the Digital Platform Services Inquiry raised concerns that expansion of these platforms has increased the risk of them engaging in harmful behaviour such as invasive data collection and practices that lock in customers and limit their choices.,"Australia’s competition watchdog said on Monday new competition laws were required in response to the rapid expansion of digital platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft in the country.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in its latest report for the Digital Platform Services Inquiry raised concerns that expansion of these platforms has increased the risk of them engaging in harmful behaviour such as invasive data collection and practices that lock in customers and limit their choices.
“Our proposed reforms include a call for targeted consumer protections and service-specific codes to prevent anti-competitive conduct by particular designated digital platforms,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.

ACCC has not made specific findings of anti-competitive conduct, but said digital platforms with significant market power can use practices such as the bundling of products, and pre-installation and default settings to limit customer choice or deter innovation from competitors.
The aforementioned five digital platforms did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for a comment.
In terms of data collection practices, ACCC found that these providers have greater access to rich consumer data via expansion, and it is not always clear from the relevant privacy policies if the data collected exceeds that which is required for device functionality or product improvement.
The regulator has also proposed new mandatory obligations on all digital platforms to address scams, harmful apps, fake reviews, including notice and action requirements and stronger verification of business users and reviews.

Must ensure competition laws are fit-for-purpose to respond to the potential challenges posed by emerging technologies such as generative AI and virtual reality, ACCC said.
Earlier this year, ACCC said it would probe the country’s fast-evolving ecosystem of digital platform service providers as part of a five-year inquiry into the sector.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/australian-regulator-calls-for-new-competition-laws-for-digital-platforms-9043814/,technology

"Lava Blaze 2 5G review: Finally, a budget smartphone with character",Lava Blaze 2 is an affordable 5G phone with a bit of a character.,"5G smartphones are becoming more accessible. In fact, there are a handful of 5G-capable devices, which cost less than Rs 10,000 now, and the Lava Blaze 2 5G is one such option. Typically, most smartphones in this price range look different, however, when it comes to functionality, they are almost identical to one another, and this is where Lava’s budget 5G phone stands out with its rear ring light.

Why ChatGPT is now my go-to AI Assistant on iPhone,"Over the past few months, I have found myself using the AI chatbot ChatGPT more often than Siri on my iPhone.","I have been using OpenAI’s ChatGPT for a few months now. While this popular AI chatbot is still a work in progress, I regularly turn to ChatGPT to get my creative juices flowing. Interestingly, while I still use Google for most things, voice assistants like Siri have taken such a backseat that I barely use them. For months, I searched for a way to use ChatGPT on my iPhone more naturally until I discovered a hack that let me turn my iPhone 15 Pro’s Action Button into a ChatGPT voice assistant. Here’s how I set up a ChatGPT shortcut as the action button on my iPhone.

Toshihiro Fujii, an astronomer at the Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan, was doing a routine data check at the Telescope Array Project in Utah. That is when he discovered some peculiar signals on May 27, 2021. On that day, the massive telescope array in the desert detected what turned out to be the second-highest extreme-energy cosmic ray ever recorded in history.

Under a thousand: An outstanding stand for your notebook and tablet,"Amkette says that the Ergo Fold can hold up to 15.6-inch notebooks, and it handles a 16-inch MacBook Pro and a 15.6 Mi NoteBook Ultra without any difficulty.","It is not the most used tech accessory but the humble laptop and tablet stand can play a rather important role in our tech lives. A well-designed stand not only allows one to prop up an electronic device on it for better viewing, but in many cases also makes it easier to work on. Many experts also claim that it is healthier to work on a notebook when you can look straight at it rather than down (as most of us do), and well, having a stand is always handy for those times when you want to watch a show or follow a match on your phone without holding it in your hands or laying it flat on a table.
Finding a well-designed stand, however, can be quite a challenge. The ones that are sturdy and big enough to support a notebook or tablet tend to be bulky and hence difficult to carry around. The ones that are compact on the other hand, are often too light and a little on the flimsy side. Which is why a number of accessory brands in recent times have started coming out with metallic stands that fold into easy-to-carry form factors. While there are a number of these options around, we are going to recommend the Amkette Ergo Fold alloy laptop stand. It comes from a well-known brand and is flexible enough to be used with a notebook, tablet and even a phone, while being very portable.

Ilya Sutskever has deep concerns about AI safety - find out what drives his skepticism.,"Where Sam Altman is known for his risk-taking approach to artificial intelligence development that sometimes even comes at the cost of safety, Ilya Sutskever plays it safer. Sutskever harbours deep concerns about the dangers of AI and reportedly played a key role in persuading fellow board members at OpenAI that Altman’s fast-paced approach to AI deployment was not the way. This sparked the series of events that led to one of the most dramatic CEO reshuffles in tech in years.
Altman ultimately emerged as the winner, though, and was reinstated as the CEO of OpenAI mere days after his firing, with Sutskever doing a 180 saying that he deeply regrets his participation in the board’s actions.

Google Pay may charge convenience fees on mobile recharge,"GPay, also known as Google Pay, may soon start levying convenience fees up to Rs 3 when users recharge their prepaid mobile plans using the app.","Google Pay, popularly known as Gpay may soon start charging convenience fees up to Rs 3 for users who recharge their mobile prepaid plans on the platform.
While PayTM and other payment platforms like PhonePe already levy a convenience fee, Google Pay was preferred by many because it did not charge extra when making mobile recharge payments.
The new convenience fee was also spotted by the known tipster Mukul Sharma on X, following which other users started saying they were charged extra as well. He went on to share some more details about Google Pay’s latest change, which suggests that the app will not charge convenience fees for mobile plans that cost between Rs 100 and Rs 200.
Google Pay is now charging convenience fees for recharges

When we tried doing a mobile recharge on Google Pay, the convenience fee did not appear for us, hinting that Google might be rolling out the new fee changes in a phased manner.

Belkin BoostCharge Pro power bank and wall charger review: Convenience on the go,I just got back from Mumbai with the Belkin BoostCharge Pro power bank and wall charger. Traveling light and staying charged has never been easier.,"I just returned from a one-day trip to Mumbai which left me wondering I travel with so many gadgets, most of which I never end up using. This also means there is always a mess of wires and chargers that I have to take along and this is just another hassle at airport security. Apple has made my life easier this year by moving the iPhone 15 to USB-C, which means I just need two different cables to get my work done — the Apple Watch charger and a USC-C cable for the iPhone and MacBook. Belkin just made my life a bit more easier.
This trip, I carried with me the new Belkin BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for the Apple Watch which also doubled up as a 10,000 mAh power bank for the iPhone and other gadgets. For a one-day trip, you usually don’t need a charger if you like me use the Apple Watch Ultra as it lasts almost two days on a single charge and you can always go to low power mode to make it last longer.
The charger itself is handy and not like a brick. (Image: Nandagopal Rajan/The Indian Express)
But this time the compact power bank was in the bag, just in case I ran out of charge. The charger itself is handy and not like a brick, given that it has a large battery inside. It has a soft rubbery finish which ensures it does not scratch easily, though inside a bag all the dust and lint does end up sticking to this surface. On one end of the power bank is the white circle that you can use for charging the Apple Watch.
ADVERTISEMENT
I used it for an overnight charge, wrapping the Apple Watch Ultra around the power bank which is quite easy to do given its size. By morning it was fully charged, even though it was only down to 60% after the first day. Since the Watch can be strapped around the charger, it is easy to charge on the move too as you can keep it in the back with the watch still attached.
After a day of meetings, I was rushing to the Mumbai airport to be on time for another meeting, which I did not want to attend on the road. As I was down to 50% and had a flight to take soon after, I plugged in the iPhone 15 Pro Max to the charger using the small USB-C cable that comes in the box. After a 30-minute Zoom call at a plush airport restaurant, I was pleased to see the phone back at full charge. On the power bank, there is a small button that lights up LEDs that show the battery level. Again a very handy feature. I saw the LED was down by one unit after the phone was charged. The power bank can charge your watch up to 14 times and the iPhone twice when it has full juice.

At Rs 10,999, the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for the Apple Watch is not very budget-friendly. But a user with multiple Apple devices would probably not care about the price.

Belkin BoostCharge Pro 140W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger
What if on your trips you had just one wall charger that could take care of all your devices? Well, that is exactly what the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 140W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger does. This handy gadget offers you multiple charging options, ranging from 20W to 140W.
ADVERTISEMENT
It has three PD 3.1 fast-charging USB-C outlets to take care of everything from the Apple Watch to the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. There is also a USB-A 140W charger below this. A small button on top releases the India pin and reveals the US pin in case you are travelling. But yes, the wall charger is a bit on the larger side given the range of stuff it has to do, and a bit heavy as well. But then this is also the only charger you will need to carry with you.

Often on my trips to the US, I carry multiple chargers as well as power strips as I don’t have multiple converters with me for the devices. I usually use the converter just on the power strip and charge all my devices on it. Now with a wall charger like this, I just need to carry this one unit for all my devices. Yes, I do travel with a range of devices that will need all these ports. With this one, I just need three USB-C cables to juice up the Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad at the same time as the USB-A powers the MacBook.
As I am reviewing the new M3 MacBook Pro, I used the charger to juice it back up to about 60 per cent in just about 40 minutes in the morning. Just enough for me to work the entire weekend given how good the battery is now on the M3 devices. The iPhone 15 Pro Max can be charged to full in about 40 minutes.
At Rs 13,999, the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 140W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger is also for those who are ready to splurge for convenience. This is a great option for those always on the move with multiple devices.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/belkin-boostcharge-pro-power-bank-and-wall-charger-review-9041793/,technology

"This sea worm’s ‘butt’ swims away to reproduce. Now, researchers know why","The mystery of how some sea worms' rear ends swim away independently to mate has perplexed scientists for decades. Now, we might have an answer.","Truth can be stranger than fiction, especially when it comes to the animal kingdom. Some annelid worms or segmented worms reproduce with a process called stolonisation, where the posterior part of their body with reproductive parts detach from the original body. That detached part is called the stolon, and it swims around by itself and spawns when it meets the opposite sex.
For it to be able to swim by itself, it needs to develop its own eyes, antennae and swimming bristles while still attached to the original body. But that has been perplexing scientists for quite a while—how does the “stolon head” from in the middle of the original body?

"What is Project Q*, the AI breakthrough from OpenAI? 5 reasons why it may threaten humanity",Project Q* has been creating ripples in the AI community. Here’s why there are so many apprehensions about this new powerful AI model.,"The last few days have been topsy-turvy in the tech world, thanks to the high-stakes drama that unfolded at OpenAI, the pioneer in AI technologies of today. It all began with the board consisting of Adam D’Angelo, Tosha McCauley, Ilya Sutskever, and Helen Toner, sacking Sam Altman. A lot of back and forth followed that, with Microsoft offering Altman a job to head a new advanced AI research team.
Meanwhile, nearly 700 employees of the 770 staff from OpenAI wrote an open letter pledging allegiance to Altman and threatened to quit and join Microsoft if the board was not dissolved and Altman was not reinstated. The four-day exile of Altman led to numerous speculations about the cause, from disagreement with board members over products, lack of consistent communication, and differences over AI safety.

Nvidia delays launch of new China-focused AI chip,Nvidia is betting on the chips to help it preserve its market share in China after it was barred from shipping products including its advanced A800 and H800 AI chips by Washington's tightened export rules.,"Nvidia has told customers in China it is delaying the launch of a new artificial intelligence chip it designed to comply with U.S. export rules until the first quarter of next year, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The delayed chip is the H20, the most powerful of three China-focused chips Nvidia has developed to comply with fresh U.S. export restrictions, the sources said, and could complicate its efforts to preserve market share in China against local rivals like Huawei.
The California-based AI chip giant had been expected to launch the new products as early as Nov. 16, chip industry newsletter SemiAnalysis reported this month.

However, the H20 launch has now been pushed back until the first quarter of next year, the sources said, with one saying they were advised it could take place in February or March.

Both sources declined to be named as the information was confidential. Nvidia declined to comment.
The sources said they were told that the H20 was being delayed due to issues server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.
In addition to the H20, Nvidia has been planning two other chips to comply with new U.S. export rules – the L20 and L2. The sources said the L20 was not facing delays and would launch according to its original schedule. They were unable to share information on the status of the L2.

The A800 and H800 were introduced as alternatives for Chinese customers in November 2022, about a month after the U.S. first banned exports of advanced microchips and equipment to China.
The H20, L20 and L2 include most of Nvidia’s newest features for AI work, but have had some of their computing power measures cut back to comply with new U.S. rules, according to SemiAnalysis’ analysis of the chips’ specifications.
The U.S. export curbs have created an opportunity for rivals such as Huawei to win orders that may have otherwise gone to Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the AI market.

X may lose up to $75 mln by year-end on advertiser exodus,"X said on Friday $11 million in revenue was at risk and the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, according to the report.","Elon Musk-owned social media company X could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pause their marketing campaigns, the New York Times reported on Friday.
Musk backing an antisemitic post on the platform last week has led several companies including Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertisements on the site formerly called Twitter.
X has struck back and sued media watchdog group Media Matters, alleging the organization defamed the platform with a report that said ads for major brands including Apple and Oracle had appeared next to posts touting Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party.

X said on Friday $11 million in revenue was at risk and the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, according to the report.
The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Advertisers have fled X since Musk bought it in October 2022 and reduced content moderation, resulting in a sharp rise in hate speech on the site, according to civil rights groups.

High-energy ‘sun goddess’ particle ‘from nowhere’ collides into Earth,"Researchers have discovered an extremely high-energy particle that seemingly came from a part of the universe where there is nothing. It was named ""Amaterasu"" after a Japanese goddess.","Scientists have detected one of the most powerful cosmic rays ever slamming into Earth but they have no idea what caused it or where it came from. The extremely high-energy particle has been named Amaterasu after the Japanese Sun goddess, and it seemingly arrived from a void in space where nothing is known to exist.
The Amaterasu particle has an energy exceeding 240 exa-electron volts (EeV), according to The Guardian. That is millions of times more powerful than the particles produced by the Large Hadron Collider, which is the most powerful accelerator ever built. It is second only to the “Oh-My-God” particle, another high-energy cosmic ray detected in 1991. That came in at 320 EeV.

"ChatGPT alternatives fast catching up: Latest Grok, Claude, Bard, Ernie updates prove so","The AI battlefield is heating up. Claude 2.1 now devours codebases whole, while Grok preps for a Twitter Blue debut with real-time insights.","ChatGPT has long enjoyed the first-mover advantage ever since it burst into the scene in November last year and there’s no telling when or if it’ll be dethroned from its position. However, following the initial shock, the ChatGPT rivals have been scrambling to improve their competitiveness.

From GPUs to NPUs: Evolution of AI hardware in smartphones,"From rendering graphics to processing neural networks, learn how smartphone processors evolved.","If you read our Google Pixel 8 review, you’d have realised how far the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have come over the years. From computational photography to on-device language models, AI is now essentially used in most of the applications on your smartphone – if it’s not powering them entirely.
But AI is quite costly in terms of computational resources since it requires performing scores of computations simultaneously. And this isn’t something CPUs are best suited for. That’s why the industry has turned to GPUs – and more recently, NPUs. Below we take a look at the role GPUs play in AI and machine learning, particularly in smartphones, and how they’re slowly passing the baton to NPUs.

WhatsApp calls not ringing on your iPhone? Here are 5 things to try,Discover the top 5 reasons your iPhone might be giving WhatsApp calls the silent treatment.,"Plenty of iPhone users have found themselves missing calls without explanation. The phone didn’t ring, buzz, or notify you, leaving you scrambling to explain why you didn’t pick up. Luckily, a little detective work usually reveals the culprit. Here are four reasons your iPhone may fail to alert you about an incoming WhatsApp call.
Connection issues
One of the top reasons your iPhone won’t notify you of a WhatsApp call is a weak or unstable internet connection. Spotty connections disrupt the signal between devices, preventing calls from coming through. Before blaming your device, check your connection bars. If low, switch location or toggle between mobile data and Wi-Fi. If the problem persists across connections, there could be a different issue at play.

OpenAI researchers warned board of AI breakthrough ahead of CEO ouster: Report,Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).,"Ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s four days in exile, several staff researchers wrote a letter to the board of directors warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm were key developments before the board’s ouster of Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Prior to his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader. The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board leading to Altman’s firing, among which were concerns over commercializing advances before understanding the consequences. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The staff who wrote the letter did not respond to requests for comment.
After being contacted by Reuters, OpenAI, which declined to comment, acknowledged in an internal message to staffers a project called Q* and a letter to the board before the weekend’s events, one of the people said. An OpenAI spokesperson said that the message, sent by long-time executive Mira Murati, alerted staff to certain media stories without commenting on their accuracy.

Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup’s search for what’s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks.
Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s future success, the source said. Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q* claimed by the researchers.
VEIL OF IGNORANCE
Researchers consider math to be a frontier of generative AI development. Currently, generative AI is good at writing and language translation by statistically predicting the next word, and answers to the same question can vary widely. But conquering the ability to do math — where there is only one right answer — implies AI would have greater reasoning capabilities resembling human intelligence. This could be applied to novel scientific research, for instance, AI researchers believe.
Unlike a calculator that can solve a limited number of operations, AGI can generalize, learn and comprehend. In their letter to the board, researchers flagged AI’s prowess and potential danger, the sources said without specifying the exact safety concerns noted in the letter. There has long been discussion among computer scientists about the danger posed by highly intelligent machines, for instance if they might decide that the destruction of humanity was in their interest.

Researchers have also flagged work by an “AI scientist” team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The group, formed by combining earlier “Code Gen” and “Math Gen” teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific work, one of the people said.
Altman led efforts to make ChatGPT one of the fastest growing software applications in history and drew investment – and computing resources – necessary from Microsoft to get closer to AGI.
In addition to announcing a slew of new tools in a demonstration this month, Altman last week teased at a summit of world leaders in San Francisco that he believed major advances were in sight.
“Four times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks, I’ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honor of a lifetime,” he said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

I tried Stuffcool’s Rover 3-in-1 wireless charger. It’s designed for those with multiple Apple devices,The Stuffcool Rover wireless charger is one of the neatest charging solution for Apple users. Here's why we think so.,"If you ever drop in and visit me at my house, I want to make one thing clear: please don’t mind if you spot cables and chargers here and there. I am not a messy person, but given the number of devices I own, it is only natural to have cables and power adapters everywhere. For someone who lives in the Apple ecosystem, there’s a good chance I have all sorts of chargers – and I am sure it’s the case with you as well. I never thought of a solution that simplifies charging until I started using the Stuffcool 3-in-1 Rover wireless charger. For Rs 4,990, the charging station acts as a multi-device charging dock and charges the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at one go, in a neat package. This past week, I tested Stuffcool’s new 3-in-1 wireless charger to find out if wireless charging stations are still a novelty or if they have improved over the years. Here is my review.
Sleek and foldable
The charger is made from premium space-grade anodized aluminium. (Image: Anuj Bhatia/The Indian Express)
When I first saw the Stuffcool Rover, I didn’t think it was a charger. Made from premium space-grade anodized aluminium, it has an unconventional design that folds out and can be taken on outstation trips, which I do frequently. Compared to other wireless chargers, it’s super compact. This thing measures 15.6 cm long and 7.5 cm wide, so it doesn’t take up much space on any nightstand or desk setup. I have moved this charger from one location to another, and it looks great wherever you keep it. Its MagSafe-compatible charging pad is suspended on a vertical arm above its base. It’s powerful enough to hold your phone firmly in place either horizontally or vertically. In fact, the phone didn’t come off when I turned the entire charger upside down.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/stuffcool-rover-3-in-1-wireless-charger-review-9039592/,technology

EU lawmakers back rules forcing Big Tech to tackle child pornography,"The proposed legislation forces messaging services, app stores and internet access providers to report and remove known and new images and videos, as well as cases of grooming.","EU lawmakers agreed on Wednesday to draft rules requiring Alphabet’s Google, Meta and other online services to identify and remove online child pornography, saying that end-to-end encryption would not be affected.
The draft rule on child sexual abuse material (CSAM), proposed by the European Commission last year, has been a bone of contention between advocates of online safety measures and privacy activists worried about surveillance.
The European Union executive came up with the CSAM proposal after the current system of voluntary detection and reporting by companies proved to be insufficient to protect children.

EU lawmakers have to thrash out the final details with member states before the draft can become legislation in a process that may be finalised next year.

The proposed legislation forces messaging services, app stores and internet access providers to report and remove known and new images and videos, as well as cases of grooming.
An EU Centre on Child Sexual Abuse will be set up to act as a hub of expertise and to forward reports to the police.
To avoid mass surveillance, EU lawmakers beefed up detection orders to allow judicial authorities to authorise time-limited orders to find and delete CSAM. These can only be issued if there is reasonable grounds of suspicion of child sexual abuse.

Companies would also be able to choose the technology used to detect such offences, as long as this is subject to an independent, public audit.
The decision by lawmakers to exempt end-to-end encryption from the draft rules drew praise from privacy activists.

After being contacted by Reuters, OpenAI, which declined to comment, acknowledged in an internal message to staffers a project called Q* and a letter to the board before the weekend’s events, one of the people said. An OpenAI spokesperson said that the message, sent by long-time executive Mira Murati, alerted staff to certain media stories without commenting on their accuracy.

Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup’s search for what’s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks.

Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s future success, the source said. Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q* claimed by the researchers.
‘VEIL OF IGNORANCE’
Researchers consider math to be a frontier of generative AI development. Currently, generative AI is good at writing and language translation by statistically predicting the next word, and answers to the same question can vary widely. But conquering the ability to do math — where there is only one right answer — implies AI would have greater reasoning capabilities resembling human intelligence. This could be applied to novel scientific research, for instance, AI researchers believe.
Unlike a calculator that can solve a limited number of operations, AGI can generalize, learn and comprehend. In their letter to the board, researchers flagged AI’s prowess and potential danger, the sources said without specifying the exact safety concerns noted in the letter. There has long been discussion among computer scientists about the danger posed by highly intelligent machines, for instance if they might decide that the destruction of humanity was in their interest.

Researchers have also flagged work by an “AI scientist” team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The group, formed by combining earlier “Code Gen” and “Math Gen” teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific work, one of the people said.
Altman led efforts to make ChatGPT one of the fastest growing software applications in history and drew investment – and computing resources – necessary from Microsoft to get closer to AGI.
In addition to announcing a slew of new tools in a demonstration this month, Altman last week teased at a summit of world leaders in San Francisco that he believed major advances were in sight.
“Four times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks, I’ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honor of a lifetime,” he said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
A day later, the board fired Altman.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-researchers-warned-board-of-ai-breakthrough-ahead-of-ceo-ouster-sources-say-9038818/,technology

Best budget Android smartphones with iPhone-like Dynamic Island,These phones offer an iPhone-like Dynamic Island on a budget.,"Even as people complain about Apple recycling designs, a small change in 2022 has earned it the admiration of the makers of Android devices — the introduction of the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The addition was a replacement of the traditional notch with an animated island that displayed notifications in the most clever way. Dynamic Island showed how graphics and animations can redefine notifications.
Shortly, after Apple introduced its new notch, Android developers scrambled to create a similar-looking feature. Using third-party apps on Android smartphones, one can create a similar notch on Android smartphones. Some Android companies have also incorporated a similar feature on some of their products.

James Webb Space Telescope reveals stunning Milky Way features in new image,The James Webb Space Telescope captured this stunning image that captures the Milky Way's centre.,"The James Webb Space Telescope focused on the dense heart of the Milky Way to take this image that captures some never-before-seen features that are yet to be explained by scientists. The star-forming region in the image is called Sagittarius C and is about 300 light-years away from Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy.
There are about 500,000 stars in the image and amidst them are many protostars, or stars that are still forming and gaining mass. These protostars glow like the Sun shining through a cloud. This young cluster houses at its centre a protostar that is over 30 times the mass of our Sun. The protostars are emerging from a cloud so dense that the light from the stars behind it cannot reach the telescope. This makes it appear less crowded when in reality, it is one of the most densely packed areas of the image.

Sony facing $7.9 bln mass lawsuit over PlayStation Store prices,Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) was sued last year on behalf of nearly 9 million people in the United Kingdom who had bought digital games or add-on content through Sony's PlayStation Store.,"Sony must face a mass lawsuit worth up to 6.3 billion pounds ($7.9 billion) over claims the PlayStation maker abused its dominant position leading to unfair prices for customers, a London tribunal ruled on Tuesday.
Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) was sued last year on behalf of nearly 9 million people in the United Kingdom who had bought digital games or add-on content through Sony’s PlayStation Store.
Alex Neill, a consumer advocate who has worked on previous campaigns, is bringing the case against Sony which is valued at up to 5 billion pounds ($6.23 billion) plus interest.
ADVERTISEMENT
Her lawyers said the aggregate damages estimate of the case was up to 6.3 billion pounds in court filings last month.
She says the company abused its dominant position by requiring digital games and add-ons to be bought and sold only via the PlayStation Store, which charges a 30% commission to developers and publishers.
The claim alleges customers have therefore paid higher prices for games and add-on content than they would have done.
Sony’s lawyers argued the case was “flawed from start to finish” and said it should be thrown out.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that Neill’s case could continue, though it said people who had made PlayStation Store purchases after the case was filed in 2022 should be removed from the proposed claimant class.
Neill said in a statement that Tuesday’s ruling was “the first step in ensuring consumers get back what they’re owed”. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

OpenAI copied tens of thousands of nonfiction books without permission to teach its large language models to respond to human text prompts, said author and Hollywood Reporter editor Julian Sancton, who is leading the proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court.
The lawsuit is one of several that have been brought by groups of copyright owners, including authors John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jonathan Franzen, against OpenAI and other tech companies over the alleged misuse of their work to train AI systems. The companies have denied the allegations.

Sancton’s complaint is the first author lawsuit against OpenAI to also name Microsoft as a defendant. The company has invested billions of dollars in the artificial intelligence startup and integrated OpenAI’s systems into its products.
A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment on the Tuesday lawsuit, citing pending litigation. Representatives for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“While OpenAI and Microsoft refuse to pay nonfiction authors, their AI platform is worth a fortune,” Sancton’s attorney Justin Nelson said in a statement. “The basis of OpenAI is nothing less than the rampant theft of copyrighted works.”
Sancton’s lawsuit said that OpenAI copied nonfiction books, including his “Madhouse at the End of the Earth: The Belgica’s Journey into the Dark Antarctic Night” to train its GPT large language models.

The report titled ‘Smartphone market share by vendor for 15 major countries during Q3 2023’ from TechInsights provides a comprehensive overview of the global market, highlighting the varied performance across different regions. While countries like Brazil, Canada, Japan, and Mexico bucked the trend with stable or growing shipments, others weren’t as fortunate. Like India, China also saw a modest 5% dip in total shipments, though Huawei and OnePlus managed to increase their numbers substantially.

Sam Altman is back at OpenAI: A timeline of all that unfolded,The last week was a whirlwind of changes at OpenAI. We break down the timeline of this unprecedented executive turnover.,"Since Friday last week, we’ve seen perhaps the biggest drama unfold in tech in decades. A surprise announcement from the OpenAI board declared that Sam Altman – AI’s current poster boy – will no longer serve as the CEO of the company. Since then, the ChatGPT creator has seen two new CEOs back to back, followed by an announcement on Wednesday about his reinstatement.
The events were something that seemed straight out of the drama TV series Succession, and things are still so fast-moving that it’s almost too difficult to keep track of them. However, we’ve put together a timeline to keep you in the loop about the high-profile weekend.

‘Teenage galaxies’ captured in extraordinarily detailed view by James Webb Space Telescope,"The James Webb Space Telescope took one of the most detailed images of ""teenage galaxies,"" helping scientists understand how galaxies form and evolve.","“Teenage galaxies” that formed just two to three billion years after the Big Bang are unusually hot and glow with light from elements like nickel. Looking into these galaxies tell scientists more about how these massive systems of stars grow and evolve.
Research published yesterday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters is part of the (Chemical Evolution Constrained using Ionized Lines in Interstellar Aurorae) survey. Scientists in July pointed the James Webb Space Telescope at 33 ancient galaxies whose light travelled more than 10 billion years to reach us and looked at them for more than a day.

"HP Victus 16 (AMD) review: A mid-tier gaming laptop, done right","HP's Victus 16 offers a large screen with an excellent battery life, making it a great day-to-day gaming laptop.","As the bezels around the display continue to shrink, laptop makers are now shifting gears to offer a slightly larger 16-inch screen. This trend is becoming mainstream, and HP is the latest to join the bandwagon. Its newest model, the Victus 16, as the name suggests, features a 16-inch screen and is powered by the Ryzen 7 7840HS CPU and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 laptop GPU. It’s a mid-tier gaming laptop with a balanced price-to-performance ratio. Here is the review of the HP Victus 16, which retails for Rs 86,999.

Design and aesthetics
With this offering, HP is clearly aiming for distinctive branding that highlights Victus more as a sub-brand. In my opinion, this move will help the brand promote and build a standalone identity that specifically caters to the gaming community. I also liked the Performance Blue colourway, which is slightly on the darker side; this also means you don’t have to clean it very often.

OpenAI investors considering suing the board after CEO’s abrupt firing,"Venture capital investors usually hold board seats or voting power in their portfolio companies but OpenAI is controlled by its nonprofit parent company OpenAI Nonprofit, which according to OpenAI's website was created to benefit ""humanity, not OpenAI investors.""","Some investors in OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, are exploring legal recourse against the company’s board, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, after the directors ousted CEO Sam Altman and sparked a potential mass exodus of employees.
Sources said investors are working with legal advisers to study their options. It was not immediately clear if these investors will sue OpenAI.
Investors worry that they could lose hundreds of millions of dollars they invested in OpenAI, a crown jewel in some of their portfolios, with the potential collapse of the hottest startup in the rapidly growing generative AI sector.OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

Microsoft owns 49% of the for-profit operating company, according to sources familiar with the matter. Other investors and employees control 49%, with 2% owned by OpenAI’s nonprofit parent, according to Semafor.
OpenAI’s board fired Altman on Friday after a “breakdown of communications,” according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
By Monday, most of OpenAI’s more than 700 employees threatened to resign unless the company replaced the board.
Venture capital investors usually hold board seats or voting power in their portfolio companies but OpenAI is controlled by its nonprofit parent company OpenAI Nonprofit, which according to OpenAI’s website was created to benefit “humanity, not OpenAI investors.”

As a result, employees have more leverage in pressuring the board than the venture capitalists who helped fund the company, said Minor Myers, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. “There is nobody exactly who is in the seat of an injured investor,” he said.
That is a feature, not a bug of OpenAI’s structure, which started out as a nonprofit but added a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 to raise capital. Keeping control of operations let the nonprofit preserve its “core mission, governance, and oversight,” according to the company’s website.
Nonprofit boards have legal obligations to the organizations they oversee. But those obligations, such as the duty to exercise care and avoid self-dealing, leave a lot of leeway for leadership decisions, experts said.
Those obligations can be further narrowed in a corporate structure such as OpenAI, which used a limited liability company as its operating arm, potentially further insulating the nonprofit’s directors from investors, said Paul Weitzel, a law professor at the University of Nebraska.

Even if investors found a way to sue, Weitzel said they would have a “weak case.” Companies have broad latitude under the law to make business decisions, even ones that backfire.
“You can fire visionary founders,” Weitzel said. Apple famously fired Steve Jobs in the 1980s, before bringing him back around a decade later.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-investors-considering-suing-the-board-after-ceos-abrupt-firing-9035617/,technology
AI system self organises to become more like human brain in a study,"Researchers at the University of Cambridge applied a very simple physical constraint to an artificial intelligence system. Interestingly, that application made the AI adapt some characteristics of the human brain.","Scientists at the University of Cambridge put physical constraints on an artificial intelligence system, similar to how human and other animal brains have to develop and operate with both physical and biological constructs. The system then developed some features of the brains of complex organisms to solve tasks.
In a study published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence today, Jascha Achterberg and Danyal Akarca from the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (MRC CBSU) at the University of Cambridge worked with their colleagues to develop a simplified version of the brain and applied some physical constraints before giving the system tasks. This technology could potentially be used to develop more efficient AI systems and even understand the human brain itself better.

OpenAI’s ex-CEO Sam Altman to lead Microsoft’s new advanced AI research team,"Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI will now lead new advanced AI research team at Microsoft.","Microsoft has hired OpenAI co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to head a “new advanced AI research team,” Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella announced on Monday. The announcement comes hours after OpenAI’s board appointed former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as chief executive officer, defying calls from investors to reinstate the ousted Sam Altman, who co-founded the company in 2015.
“We’re extremely excited to share the news that Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, together with colleagues, will be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team,” said Nadella. “We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success.”
I’m super excited to have you join as CEO of this new group, Sam, setting a new pace for innovation. We’ve learned a lot over the years about how to give founders and innovators space to build independent identities and cultures within Microsoft, including GitHub, Mojang Studios,…

Nadella mentioned that Altman and Brockman will be joined by “colleagues,” suggesting that Microsoft may have plans to hire other former OpenAI employees who left the company over the weekend.

We look forward to getting to know Emmett Shear and OAI’s new leadership team and working with them,” Nadella added.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Altman acknowledged he was joining Microsoft by quoting Nadella, saying “the mission continues.” Nadella then responded by providing a subtle hint at what would be Altman’s role at Microsoft. “We’ve learned a lot over the years about how to give founders and innovators space to build independent identities and cultures within Microsoft, including GitHub, Mojang Studios, and LinkedIn, and I’m looking forward to having you do the same.”
Following the announcement, hundreds of OpenAI employees have signed a letter demanding that either OpenAI’s remaining board members resign or those OpenAI’s employees join Microsoft and work under Sam Altman.
About 650 / 770 signed at this moment. As people start waking up, more will come. All the efforts started after 1:30 AM, 500+ within two hours and all of this after 2 crazy days with very little sleep.

Everything you did not know about OpenAI’s co-founder and CEO Sam Altman,"After a CEO reshuffle over the weekend, Sam Altman is set to be reinstated to his former position at OpenAI.","When 38-year-old Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, was fired, parallels were drawn between his departure from the ChatGPT maker and how Steve Jobs was ousted by Apple in 1985. Like Jobs, who made a triumphant return to Apple years later, Altman too, was sacked by OpenAI’s board for “not being candid in his communications” and was replaced by Emmett Shear as chief executive officer. Altman’s sudden departure from OpenAI sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley, with some seeing it as a boardroom coup. Now that Altman is back as CEO of OpenAI after intense pressure from employees and investors, we take a look at unknown facts about him.
Early life and his love for Mac
Sam Altman was born in Chicago in 1985 but spent his formative years in St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended John Burroughs School, a prestigious private institution. He excelled academically, ranking among the top students in his class. He grew up as the oldest of four siblings in what he calls a “middle-class Jewish family.” When Altman was 8 years old, his parents, Connie Gibstine, a dermatologist, and Jerry Altman, a real estate broker, brought home his first computer, a Macintosh LC II. In an interview with New York Magazine, Altman recounted how this pivotal event ignited his passion for programming, stating, “The Mac was this dividing line in my life: before I had a computer and after.”

Are you a plumber or a tech entrepreneur? Nuggets from Kerala’s Huddle Global 2023,"Huddle Global 2023 is a startup festival organised from November 16-18 by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), bringing together startups, investors, bankers and various international ecosystem players.","“Are you doing plumbing work or are you running a tech startup.”
These were the words of an anxious mother questioning her son after hearing him talking to his team in plumbing jargon. The son was Srinath Ravichandran, Co-Founder and CEO of Agnikul Kosmos, a space tech startup.
Talking to an audience of startups, investors and students on the challenges of building a space tech startup which looks really hi-tech from the outside but involves a lot of very mundane work, Ravichandran, a Wall Street trader turned Aerospace Engineer, reminisced how he was like a plumber most of the time, building things very patiently. Now, Agnikul Cosmos is building launch vehicles capable of taking micro and nanosatellites to Low Earth Orbit on-demand.

Ravichandran was speaking at the Huddle Global 2023, a startup festival organised from November 16-18 by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), on the issues and opportunities of building a space tech startup. Space Tech was among the focus areas with around 350 medium and small enterprises in and around Thiruvananthapuram connected to the space tech ecosystem.

If Uber code can be written on the beaches…
Huddle Global 2023 also had Kerala StartUp Mission (KSUM) promoting Kerala as a startup destination, with CEO Anoop Ambika highlighting that “if Travis Kalanick the co-founder of Uber could choose Varkala as a tranquil place to develop his idea and write the basic code for the Uber app, others can do it too”. Kerala is keen to welcome other startups too to use the state as an incubator, he added.
Ambika said with 38,000 sqkm of urban agglomeration, beaches and tranquility, Kerala presents a golden opportunity for startups. “They should come with an idea and go back with the code.”
KSUM also inked an MoU with leading professional services firm Grant Thornton for conducting a strategic study on empowering Thiruvananthapuram as an emerging technology hub and a premier destination for startups.

To make it more interesting, KSUM brought in cricketer Jonty Rhodes who recalled how he used to throw himself at the ball to prevent runs from being taken, and talked about the importance of practice and focus to motivate founders at the event. KSUM has also set up Startup Infinity centres in Brussels and Melbourne, apart from the earlier one in Dubai helping startups from Kerala get a foothold in these countries.

It was not a success talk all the way…
It was not a mere exchange of success stories. Ganesh Krishan, serial investor, promoter director of BigBasket, Home Lane and Fresh Menu and partner at Growthstory.in, said: “Don’t ask me about the mistakes I made. It might take the whole evening to recount them. It is like football, don’t worry about how many goals you missed, just worry about the goals you scored.” He recalled how he was so involved and engaged in the hardware side of the IT story at IT&T (later acquired by iGate), he refused to see the opportunities that Infosys and Wipro saw and exploited. He said the opportunity was so big and staring at the face, and yet he was so immersed in building his business that he missed it. He rued that he could be owning a software giant now, if not for his lack of sensitivity to the changes happening around him.
The funding winter…
Anil Joshi of Unicorn India Ventures was optimistic about startups in Kerala and said almost 40 per cent of his investment portfolio was from Tier 2 cities. He has over time focussed on picking winners and, either by choice or accident, most of the winners had come from smaller towns, many of them from Kerala. Joshi predicted that 50 per cent of the investment portfolios of all venture capitalists would be from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities of India by 2025.
Most investors talked about the end of high valuations, and the need for value in the startup either through technology or through innovation. Some even called for a relook at the governance framework for startups, asking if investors and venture funds could insist on so much paperwork they could also insist on an independent board which could look after the interests of other stakeholders like customers, employees instead of merely looking at the financial interests of the investors.
ADVERTISEMENT
There were also discussions about the rising influence of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and how they were perhaps fighting off the ‘funding winter’. Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Advisor to Government of India, said 49 per cent of startups are from tier-2 and tier-3 cities, which has turned out to be a game-changer as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities. “Historically, a perception was held that small towns were difficult places to conduct business, but with the internet penetration, better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity this is no longer true”.
Interesting startups…
Among the 100-odd startups that showcased their products was Aakri, a waste management company focused on domestic biomedical waste segment filtered using clean green tech. It is also an online platform where buyers and sellers in the scrap industry can connect and trade. Aakri app is a solution for those confused about disposing of biomedical waste. If you register on the app, their representatives will come home or to the office and collect the refuse, including e-waste, apart from biomedical waste.
Robotic manhole cleaner Bandicoot was a big draw at the event with them launching Mini, a new affordable version of their product the Bandicoot. The company Gen Robotics, has changed India’s urban sanitation landscape with its robotics scavenger. By leveraging robotics and artificial intelligence, the Bandicoot Robot enters and cleans manholes, eliminating the need for sanitation workers to expose themselves to dangerous environments. The company was founded in 2017 and is considered a social impact success story. The product is being used by local bodies, companies and government agencies in 22 states.
Another interesting product at the expo was SafetyWhat a SaaS platform that uses AI, computer vision and IoT to analyse and prevent workplace hazards and accidents It uses AI analytics to detect and estimate the risks in unsafe workspace activities or equipment failures and trigger automated alerts for response teams. SafetyWhat AI uses the power of over 50 advanced AI detection models to proactively identify and address potential safety hazards, ensuring the well-being of the workers.

"Microsoft now has a ‘Windows app’, but its unavailable on ChromeOS and Android","Microsoft recently unveiled a new 'Windows App' that lets users access their Windows powered machines on devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops.","At the recently concluded Ignite 2023 event, Microsoft announced a new ‘Windows App’, which, as the name suggests, lets users access Windows-powered PCs from various devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and more.
The all-new ‘Windows App’ is part of Microsoft’s effort to bring its operating system to more devices and works with macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Windows and even works on web browsers. However, there is no word if ‘Windows App’ will be available on Chromebooks and Android.
According to a recent blog post by Microsoft, the Windows App is currently in ‘Preview’ and acts as a gateway to Windows 365, Azure Virtual Desktop, Remote Desktop Services, Microsoft Dev Box, and remote PCs. For those on web browsers, the new feature will enable users to access their Windows PC from anywhere without having to download or install anything.

While the ‘Windows App’ for Windows has a sign-in prompt that lets you sign in using a personal account, it looks like the option is not working right now. However, a report by The Verge suggests the tech giant might add support for consumers in the future.
A screenshot shared by Microsoft shows that users will see a list of cloud computers along with individual apps, meaning they might be able to directly launch apps from the Windows App launch on Cloud PCs.
With the new ‘Windows App’, Microsoft may be planning to offer the full Windows experience on the cloud. Now that Windows is an app, this might set the stage for the tech giant to expand its services on platforms not running on Microsoft’s popular operating system.

"Watch this Space: NASA stands behind SpaceX, but with bated breath","NASA administrator Bill Nelson congratulated SpaceX on the launch, saying “Congrats to the teams who made progress on today’s flight test.","SpaceX’s Starship — the largest launch vehicle ever built in human history — launched on its second-ever flight on Saturday, taking off from the company’s Starbase launch facility in Boca Chica, Texas. But shortly after the upper stage separated and reached its target altitude, it went through a “rapid unscheduled disassembly,” according to SpaceX. Basically, it exploded.
This was the second test flight for the Starship system. The first one happened in April this year. Even that launch ended in an explosion. I am sure you can see somewhat of a pattern forming. “Such an incredibly successful day. Even though we did have a rapid unscheduled disassembly of both the Super Heavy Booster and the ship,” said a SpaceX announcer during a live stream of the launch on Saturday.

Calling it an “incredibly successful day” is equally as untruthful as calling it a complete failure. The actual truth is this—SpaceX managed to launch the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built. Compared to its first flight, Starship went much further since the booster separated from the ship before it disintegrated. It would be most accurate to say that the test was a partial success, and SpaceX needs to learn from its mistakes to improve further.
ADVERTISEMENT
NASA administrator Bill Nelson congratulated SpaceX on the launch, saying “Congrats to the teams who made progress on today’s flight test. Spaceflight is a bold adventure demanding a can-do spirit and daring innovation. Today’s test is an opportunity to learn—then fly again.
Congrats to the teams who made progress on today’s flight test.
Spaceflight is a bold adventure demanding a can-do spirit and daring innovation. Today’s test is an opportunity to learn—then fly again.
Together @NASA and @SpaceX will return humanity to the Moon, Mars & beyond. https://t.co/QGjwr45KM1
— Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) November 18, 2023
Nelson is correct. Space is hard. What is important is that you keep trying until you get it right. This is especially true for a startup like SpaceX. The Elon Musk-led company’s philosophy has been to fail faster and keep improving until you get it right. That is exactly why it is easily the most successful private space technology company.
Let me illustrate. Both SpaceX and Boeing, an aerospace industry heavyweight, were given contracts by NASA in 2014 to develop a crewed spacecraft to take astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA gave Boeing a $4.2 billion contract while SpaceX was given $2.6 billion. Since then, SpaceX has launched astronauts to the International Space Station eight times with its Crew Dragon spacecraft. Boeing has not managed even one launch with its Starliner.
But that is not to say that SpaceX is getting everything right. If it had succeeded with the test on Saturday, Starship would have been cleared for additional crucial tests next year to prove that it can transfer hundreds of tons of fuel between two spaceships in orbit. Eventually, Starship would also be tested for its ability to carry crew beyond low orbit and into deep space.
ADVERTISEMENT
This is because NASA selected SpaceX to provide the human landing system that will transport Artemis 3 astronauts from an Orion spacecraft in lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon near its south pole.
The Artemis program has already been hit with multiple delays, and Artemis 2, the second mission of the series, is now set to launch in November 2024. Even if NASA manages to send astronauts on a trip around the Moon and back by then, delays to Starship could delay the Artemis 3 mission.
The funny thing is that NASA and SpaceX are two very different organisations. The government space agency is very bureaucratic and takes things very slowly, making sure that everything is right with each test before going forward with it. The private space company moves fast, and once something goes wrong, it fixes it and improves it before repeating it. This process eventually results in success.
Despite the deep differences in space exploration philosophy, the two organisations are heavily dependent on each other. NASA plans to use SpaceX technology for many of its future missions exploring the Moon, Mars and beyond. SpaceX is heavily dependent on NASA for the contracts that keep the company going.

"Germany, France and Italy reach agreement on future AI regulation",The three governments are in favour of binding voluntary commitments for both large and small AI providers in the European Union.,"An agreement on how artificial intelligence should be regulated in the future has been reached by Germany, France and Italy, according to a joint paper seen by Reuters, which is expected to accelerate negotiations at the European level.

During the discussions, the European Parliament proposed that the code of conduct should initially only be binding for major AI providers, which are primarily from the U.S.
However, the three EU governments have warned against this apparent competitive advantage for smaller European providers. This could lead to less trust in the security of these smaller providers and therefore fewer customers, they said.
The rules of conduct and transparency should therefore be binding for everyone, they added.

Initially, no sanctions should be imposed, according to the paper.
However, if violations of the code of conduct are identified after a certain period of time, a system of sanctions could be set up. In the future, a European authority would monitor compliance with the standards, the paper said.

SpaceX Starship launch failed minutes after reaching space,"The launch was the second attempt to fly Starship mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, following an April attempt that ended in explosive failure about four minutes after lift-off.","SpaceX’s uncrewed spacecraft Starship, developed to carry astronauts to the moon and beyond, failed in space shortly after lifting off on Saturday, cutting short its second test but making it further than an earlier attempt that ended in an explosion.
The two-stage rocketship blasted off from the Elon Musk-owned company’s Starbase launch site near Boca Chica in Texas, helping boost the Starship spacecraft as high as 90 miles (148 km) above ground on a planned 90-minute test mission to space and back.
But the rocket’s Super Heavy first stage booster, though it achieved a crucial maneuver to separate with its core Starship stage, exploded over the Gulf of Mexico shortly after detaching, a SpaceX webcast showed.

Meanwhile, the core Starship stage boosted further toward space, but a few minutes later a company broadcaster said that SpaceX mission control suddenly lost contact with the vehicle.

“We have lost the data from the second stage… we think we may have lost the second stage,” SpaceX engineer and livestream host John Insprucker said. He added that engineers believe an automated flight termination command was triggered to destroy the rocket, though the reason was unclear.
About eight minutes into the test mission, a camera view tracking the Starship booster appeared to show an explosion that suggested the vehicle failed at that time. The rocket’s altitude was 91 miles (148 km).
The launch was the second attempt to fly Starship mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, following an April attempt that ended in explosive failure about four minutes after lift-off.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees commercial launch sites, confirmed a mishap occurred that “resulted in a loss of the vehicle,” adding no injuries or property damage have been reported.
The agency said it will oversee a SpaceX-led investigation into the testing failure and will need to approve SpaceX’s plan to prevent it from happening again.
The mission’s objective was to get Starship off the ground in Texas and into space just shy of reaching orbit, then plunge through Earth’s atmosphere for a splashdown off Hawaii’s coast. The launch had been scheduled for Friday but was pushed back by a day for a last-minute swap of flight-control hardware.

TESTING FAILURES
Starship’s failure to meet all of its test objectives could pose a setback for SpaceX. The FAA will need to review the company’s failure investigation and review its application for a new launch license. SpaceX officials have complained that such regulatory reviews take too long.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the other hand, the failure in a program for which SpaceX plans to spend roughly $2 billion this year was in line with the company’s risk-tolerant culture that embraces fast-paced testing and re-testing of prototypes to hasten design and engineering improvements.
“More things were successful than in the previous test, including some new capabilities that were significant,” said Carissa Christensen, CEO of space analytics firm BryceTech.
“There’s not money and patience for unlimited tests, but for a vehicle that is so different and so big, two, three, four, five tests is not excessive,” Christensen said.
At roughly 43 miles (70 km) in altitude, the rocket system executed the crucial maneuver to separate the two stages – something it failed to do in the last test – with the Super Heavy booster intended to plunge into Gulf of Mexico waters while the core Starship booster blasts further to space using its own engines.
ADVERTISEMENT
But the Super Heavy booster blew up moments later, followed by the Starship stage’s own explosion. SpaceX in a post on social media platform X said “success comes from what we learn,” adding that the core Starship stage’s engines “fired for several minutes on its way to space.”
A fully successful test would have marked a key step toward achieving SpaceX’s ambition producing a large, multi-purpose, spacecraft capable of sending people and cargo back to the moon later this decade for NASA, and ultimately to Mars.
SpaceX’s worker safety culture underpinning its speedy development ethos is facing scrutiny by lawmakers after a Reuters investigation documented hundreds of injuries at the rocket company’s U.S. manufacturing and launch sites.

CLOCK IS TICKING
NASA, SpaceX’s primary customer, has a considerable stake in the success of Starship, which the U.S. space agency is counting on to play a central role of landing humans on the moon within the next few years under its human spaceflight program, Artemis, successor to the Apollo missions.
ADVERTISEMENT
NASA chief Bill Nelson, who has made competition with China a core need for speed in Artemis, said Saturday’s Starship test was an “opportunity to learn — then fly again.”
Musk – SpaceX’s founder, chief executive and chief engineer – sees Starship as eventually replacing the company’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket as the centerpiece of its launch business that already lofts most of the world’s satellites and other commercial payloads into space.
“The clock is ticking,” said Chad Anderson, a SpaceX investor and managing partner of venture capital firm Space Capital. “NASA has a timeline where they’re trying to get to the moon, and this is their primary vehicle to do it. So SpaceX needs to deliver on a timeline.”
Jaret Matthews, CEO of lunar rover startup Astrolab that has booked space on a future Starship flight, toured SpaceX’s Starbase site earlier this year and said he expects the company to swiftly resume tests after the Saturday flight.

Though such a pace is expected to be driven largely by the FAA’s review and the extent of Starship’s technical failures.
“They have the next number of vehicles already lined up in the factory ready to go,” he said. “I think people will be shocked by the cadence that emerges next year.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/spacex-starship-launch-failed-minutes-after-reaching-space-9032988/,technology
How Humane’s AI Pin reminds one of iPod Shuffle’s attempts to offer a screen-less future,Apple first attempted to venture into the realm of screen-less devices with the third-generation iPod Shuffle way back in 2009.,"When Humane’s AI Pin debuted last week, it sparked a whole new conversation about the elusive dream of creating screen-less devices. However, it was Apple that first attempted to venture into the realm of screen-less devices with the third-generation iPod Shuffle way back in 2009. Although Apple no longer sells the iPod Shuffle, that one device was a precursor to what could possibly be the user interface of the future, allowing you to clip the tiny MP3 player to your shirt and control the music player through an innovative voice-and-remote interface.

The iPod Shuffle entered the market at a time when Apple’s hip music player had already become a pop cultural phenomenon. Sales of the iPod were skyrocketing, and Apple was a few years away from unveiling the iPhone. On January 11, 2005, just minutes before Apple CEO Steve Jobs concluded his Macworld keynote at the Moscone Center, he addressed a packed audience by announcing the iPod Shuffle for the first time as “One more thing”. This device was different from the iPod we knew — it looked like a pack of Wrigley’s gum — no click wheel, no screen, no hard disk. One might have wondered if the Shuffle was even an iPod.
However, in Steve Jobs’ mind, the Shuffle was aimed at low-cost flash memory-based players, offering not only a huge growth opportunity for Apple but also serving as an entry into the Apple ecosystem. The iPod Shuffle sold for $99 and $149, depending on the storage configuration. While the Shuffle lacked a display to show what song was playing, it did connect with the iTunes software, like other iPods in the lineup. However, what stood out about the Shuffle was its ability to play a set of music at random, hence the name Shuffle.

While many thought the Shuffle would be a one-off product for Apple, Jobs had something else in mind. Apple continued to launch the iPod Shuffle, starting with its introduction, and the last significant update came out in 2010. The second-generation iPod Shuffle was a departure from the first-generation model. It was much smaller, and, in fact, one could wear it through a smaller clip. To reduce the size and make it more compact, Apple had to bring several design changes, like ditching the USB plug and replacing it with a dock that synced data via the headphone port. That iPod Shuffle came in a host of fun colours.
But in 2009, with the introduction of the third-generation iPod Shuffle, Apple stunned everyone. That model was not only the smallest iPod Shuffle but also the first buttonless iPod ever. It was 1.8 inches tall and 0.3 inches thin, being half the size of its predecessor while offering more storage. The $79 third-generation model came with no display, like other iPod Shuffles in the past, and had a premium design made of aluminum but ditched the physical controls, replaced by the in-line controls of the bundled pair of earphones, with the only exception of a small slider that let you pick between playing songs in order, shuffling, and switching it off.

From the very beginning, the iPod was all about the user interface. The first-generation iPod had a click wheel, a simple and uncluttered way to control the music. In retrospect, the click wheel allowed users to use the iPod without looking at the screen. The click wheel was a departure from how devices were controlled even then, and to some extent now, which may have improved interfaces and use sophisticated touch screens but require constant attention while you interact with them.
But like the original iPod, the third-generation iPod Shuffle was the polar opposite — a breakthrough device, but unfortunately, Apple didn’t get much credit. The third-generation iPod Shuffle brought a brand-new text-to-speech system that helped users navigate their music, as well as a new remote control that Apple embedded in the earbud cord. Essentially, Apple removed the controls from the iPod itself and moved them to the remote on the headphones. It was a different experience of using the iPod Shuffle—a non-traditional way of how people used to interact with their iPods. Press it once to pause the music; twice to skip to the next track; three times to go to the last track; press and hold to hear the artist and song title; press twice and hold to fast-forward; press three times and hold to fast-reverse. On paper, putting all the controls on the headphones may sound nightmarish, but in reality, the interface was very intuitive.
ADVERTISEMENT
The iPod Shuffle 3rd generation was a peak into the screenless devices’ future.
But where the third-generation iPod Shuffle shone was its ability to be completely invisible in the way you control and interact with the music player. Apple introduced something called VoiceOver with that model, which allowed the iPod to read information about what’s playing, such as reading you the name of the song and artist of the current song, and giving users the ability to choose different playlists. All it required was a long press on the remote’s center button, and the Shuffle started reading the names of your playlists; release it when you hear the one you want to select.
Not only did VoiceOver make the iPod Shuffle an even more interesting product, but it also, in a way, compensated for the lack of a display to control playback. That being said, VoiceOver wasn’t a complete replacement for what a display can do, and Apple understood it. The third-generation Shuffle met with a lukewarm response, and the reason was pretty understandable. Despite being a forward-looking device, the Shuffle was limited in features and functionalities; locating a particular song was nearly impossible, and the device wasn’t designed to sort all the songs in alphabetical order; the Shuffle didn’t understand the concept of albums.
Apple’s new VoiceOver feature enabled the iPod to speak your song titles, artists and playlist names.
Sure, Apple was looking at a button-less future with the iPod Shuffle, but there were too many complexities. Many people found the iPod Shuffle 3rd gen confusing to use, and Apple had published a 4-minute video tour walking users through the controls and features as a rescue measure. However, one thing that irked many people about the third-generation model was that there were no other headphones on the market that had playback controls on a remote that worked with the Shuffle.
Apple’s experiment with the button-less iPod came to an end with the fourth-generation iPod Shuffle. The company caved in and put buttons back on the iPod, though this time the combination of the remote and VoiceOver was actually successful.

OpenAI’s $86 billion share sale in jeopardy after Altman firing,The news comes after the board of the company behind ChatGPT fired Altman on Friday.,"A planned sale of OpenAI employee shares that would value the startup at about $86 billion on paper hangs in the balance after the sudden firing of CEO Sam Altman and a slew of top executive departures, the Information reported on Saturday.
The tender offer, which Thrive Capital is leading, has not yet closed but has been in its final stages and was expected to be completed as soon as next month, the report added, citing a person familiar with the matter.
OpenAI and Thrive Capital did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.

The departures blindsided many employees who discovered the abrupt management change from an internal message and the company’s public facing blog.

"Ousted OpenAI CEO Altman discusses possible return, mulls new AI venture","The possibilities of a return or a restart for Altman, seen by many as the face of generative AI, are in flux, said the source, who asked not to be named because the source was not authorized to speak on behalf of the parties involved.","Sam Altman, the just ousted CEO of OpenAI, is discussing a possible return to the company behind the ChatGPT bot even as he considers launching a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture, a person briefed on the matter said on Saturday.
A day after the board fired him in a surprise move that rocked the tech world, Altman was talking with OpenAI executives about improving the company’s governance structure while he discusses with some core OpenAI researchers and others loyal to Altman how they could start a new AI company, the person said.

The possibilities of a return or a restart for Altman, seen by many as the face of generative AI, are in flux, said the source, who asked not to be named because the source was not authorized to speak on behalf of the parties involved.

OpenAI and Altman did not reply to requests for comment.
Investors in OpenAI, including its biggest backer Microsoft, are discussing damage control, including possibly pushing the board to restore Altman as CEO, fearing a mass exodus of talent without him, other sources said.
Kholsa Ventures, an early backer of OpenAI, wants Altman back at OpenAI but “will back him in whatever he does next,” the fund’s founder Vinod Khosla posted on X on Saturday.
Microsoft declined to comment. It reportedly owns 49% of the company, while other investors and employees control 49%, with 2% owned by OpenAI’s nonprofit parent.

Emotions ran high on Saturday as current and former employees were angered by Altman’s sacking and worried over how an upcoming $86 billion share sale could be affected by the sudden management upheaval.
OpenAI, a nonprofit co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk, launched ChatGPT on Nov. 30 last year, setting off a global sensation over generative AI technology that quickly became the world’s fastest-growing software application. It set off a wave of investments and announcements across industries to use AI to enhance everything from financial services and healthcare to entertainment and media.
Trained on reams of data, generative AI can create human-like content, helping users spin up term papers, complete science homework and even write entire novels. After ChatGPT’s launch, regulators scrambled to catch up: the European Union revised its AI Act and the U.S. kicked off AI regulation efforts.
By Saturday, some shell-shocked employees contemplated quitting if Altman was not restored by the end of the weekend, one source said. Others expressed support for joining Altman in starting a company, a third person familiar with the matter said.

Former OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who said he quit OpenAI over Altman’s firing on Friday, is expected to join any effort, according to the Information, which earlier reported the possible new venture, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Brockman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.
Some researchers at OpenAI, including Szymon Sidor, have quit the company over the CEO change, but it was unclear if Sidor and others would join a new Altman venture, two people familiar with the matter said. Sidor confirmed quitting.
Altman and Apple’s former design chief Jony Ive have been discussing building a new AI hardware device, the Information reported in September. It reported that SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son had been involved in the conversation. Altman’s ouster was over a “breakdown of communications,” not “malfeasance,” Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap wrote in an internal company memo on Saturday that was viewed by Reuters.

Govt investigating whether China-linked agencies are behind Apple spyware attack,"In October, Opposition leaders across parties — from Congress’s Shashi Tharoor to AAP’s Raghav Chadha to TMC’s Mahua Moitra — received a “threat notification” from Apple warning of a “potential state-sponsored spyware attack” on their iPhones.","As part of its investigation into claims that several Indian Opposition politicians and journalists received threat notifications from Apple, the government’s nodal cybersecurity agency has shifted its focus on a predictable foe – it is exploring whether agencies linked to the Chinese government were behind the attempted breach, The Indian Express has learnt.
“Most of the iPhones that were targeted were made in China, as per preliminary inputs we have received from Apple. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) is investigating if the place of production has something to do with a vulnerability in the iPhones, and whether the hack was attempted by agencies linked to China,” a senior government official, privy to CERT-In’s investigation, told this paper.
In October, Opposition leaders across parties — from Congress’s Shashi Tharoor to AAP’s Raghav Chadha to TMC’s Mahua Moitra — received a “threat notification” from Apple warning of a “potential state-sponsored spyware attack” on their iPhones. They hit out at the Centre, and suggested that it was behind the spyware attack attempt.
ADVERTISEMENT
Apple later issued a statement saying it “does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker”. IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw at the time said that much of the information provided by Apple on the issue was “vague and non-specific in nature”, and urged the iPhone maker to join the probe with more accurate information about the alleged spyware attack.
Explained | What is Apple’s ‘state-sponsored attackers’ alert, received by multiple Opposition leaders?
It is learnt that since Apple started sending out these alerts in late 2021, individuals in 150 countries have received such threat notifications. This paper has also learnt that according to Apple India’s internal records, at least 20 Indians with iPhones received the threat notification from the company last month.
Earlier this month, the CERT-In sent a detailed questionnaire to the company asking about current vulnerabilities in Apple’s operating system and how long the company will take to issue a security patch to fix the holes. Another key question the agency is investigating, as is Apple, is whether there was a breach, or if it was an attempted hack.
The agency has also asked the company to explain what it means by a “state-sponsored attack” and when it concludes that an attack was initiated by a state-backed entity.
ADVERTISEMENT
“CERT-In is still in the process of its investigation and has asked Apple for specific inputs. I am given to understand that the company will fly down a team of experts from the US by the end of November to assist CERT-In with its probe,” a second government official said, requesting anonymity since the investigation is private.
ICYMI | CERT-In, Apple teams to probe snooping alert; Opp MPs want IT panel meet
Apple is understood to have preliminarily told the government that iPhones can have loopholes especially when military grade hacking attempts are made, and that the company is not equipped to remotely analyse the hack on a device level since it would require a great degree of access which could impact a user’s privacy further. Apple did not respond to a detailed set of questions despite multiple requests. An email sent to the IT Ministry went unanswered.
Investigations into similar issues in the past haven’t yielded much. In 2021, the Supreme Court had formed a committee of technical experts to look into allegations of unauthorised surveillance using the Pegasus software developed by Israeli firm NSO Group.
The Pegasus controversy had broken following media reports of alleged illegal use of the software to tap the phones of some activists, journalists and politicians. Subsequently, several petitions were filed in the Supreme Court seeking an inquiry into the charges.

It is indeed a relief at a time when living expenses are at an all-time high, and saving money is nearly impossible.

We will soon need ‘neuro rights’ to protect our brains and thoughts from technology,"The question is not whether there will be a machine that can read your mind. Rather, it is when. Before that, governments across the world need to consider ""neurorights"" to protect citizens' brains against neurotechnology.","In today’s digital world, nothing you do and nothing you say is private. Not only do the walls have ears but they are also connected to the internet. There is only one space in the world that is truly private to you and that is your mind. But even that won’t be true for long.
Elon Musk’s Neuralink may seem like it borders on science fiction. But the day is not far when there will be a machine that can read and maybe even alter your mind. Some advocates for Neurorights, or human rights specifically aimed at protecting the brain, want to put in place regulations before this becomes a reality.
Jack Gallant, a cognitive scientist at UC Berkeley, and other researchers published a paper elaborating on a rudimentary way of “reading minds.” Volunteers in a study were asked to watch hours of video clips while their heads were inside an MRI machine. The researchers then trained a neural network on a dataset that linked recorded brain activity to each corresponding frame of video. After that, the researchers asked the volunteers to watch new videos while still recording MRI data. They then fed the data into the AI model that they trained earlier. The model was able to generate a very vague but identifiable reconstruction of some of the imagery that the volunteers watched. The paper, by the way, was published in 2011.

In 2021, Chile’s senate approved a bill, the first of its kind in the world, to amend the constitution to protect “neuro rights” or brain rights. This made Chile the first country in the world to enshrine neurorights in its constitution. But did the South American country jump in prematurely?
Guido Girardi, a former Chilean senator who played an important role in the legislation, compared neurotechnology to something else legislators might have been a little late to respond to—social media. Chile did not want to be late again. Neurotechnology, when it proliferates more widely, might have bigger implications for society than social media. The argument here is that perhaps it’s prudent to get ahead of the technology for once.
Not too early, not too late
But going early can also have its downsides. Especially when we are not quite sure about what the technology will be capable of doing in the future.

"Xiaomi, Sony, and more: Top 6 tech brands shifting gears to electric vehicles","Smartphone companies are not only making phones, but also cars. Discover how Xiaomi, Huawei, and others are using their smartphone expertise to enter the electric vehicle market.","If you have been stepping out lately, you might have spotted a growing number of vehicles with green number plates on the road. That’s not a coincidence at all – India’s electric vehicle (EV) market is growing fast and is projected to skyrocket in the coming years, following a global trend of shifting away from fossil fuels.
Interestingly, some of the players who are eyeing this opportunity are not traditional carmakers, but smartphone companies. It makes sense for these tech giants to use their expertise and massive cash flows to enter an emerging EV market, rather than compete with established rivals in the saturated ICE (internal combustion engine) space. Also, EVs are not just about batteries and motors, but also about smart technologies such as voice control and assisted driving, which are the forte of mobile manufacturers.

Part of Chandrayaan-3 launch vehicle makes uncontrolled re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere: ISRO,The re-entry of the rocket body took place within 124 days of its launch.,"The cryogenic upper stage of the LVM3 M4 launch vehicle, which successfully injected the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into the intended orbit on July 14 this year, made an uncontrolled re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, the ISRO said.
This rocket body was part of the LVM-3 M4 launch vehicle, it said.
It re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere around 14:42 IST on Wednesday.

“The probable impact point was predicted over the North Pacific Ocean. The final ground track did not pass over India,” the Indian Space Research Organisation said in a statement.

The re-entry of the rocket body took place within 124 days of its launch. The post-mission orbital lifetime of the LVM3 M4 cryogenic upper stage is, thus, fully compliant with the “25-year rule” for low-Earth orbit objects as recommended by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), ISRO said.
Post Chandrayaan-3 injection, the upper stage had also undergone “passivation” to remove all residual propellant and energy sources to minimise the risks of accidental explosions as per the space debris mitigation guidelines prescribed by the United Nations and IADC, it was stated.
“Passivation and post-mission disposal of this rocket body in adherence to the internationally accepted guidelines once again reaffirms India’s commitment to preserve the long-term sustainability of outer space activities,” the ISRO added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/part-of-chandrayaan-3-launch-vehicle-makes-uncontrolled-re-entry-into-earths-atmosphere-isro-9028635/,technology
"Microsoft introduces its own chips for AI, with eye on cost",Microsoft gave few technical details that would allow gauging the chips' competitiveness versus those of traditional chipmakers.,"Microsoft on Wednesday announced a duo of custom-designed computing chips, joining other big tech firms that – faced with the high cost of delivering artificial intelligence services – are bringing key technologies in-house.
Microsoft said it does not plan to sell the chips but instead will use them to power its own subscription software offerings and as part of its Azure cloud computing service.
At its Ignite developer conference in Seattle, Microsoft introduced a new chip, called Maia, to speed up AI computing tasks and provide a foundation for its $30-a-month “Copilot” service for business software users, as well as for developers who want to make custom AI services.

The Maia chip was designed to run large language models, a type of AI software that underpins Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI service and is a product of Microsoft’s collaboration with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

Microsoft and other tech giants such as Alphabet are grappling with the high cost of delivering AI services, which can be 10 times greater than for traditional services such as search engines.
Microsoft executives have said they plan to tackle those costs by routing nearly all of the company’s sprawling efforts to put AI in its products through a common set of foundational AI models. The Maia chip, they said, is optimized for that work.
“We think this gives us a way that we can provide better solutions to our customers that are faster and lower cost and higher quality,” said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president of Microsoft’s cloud and AI group.
ADVERTISEMENT
Microsoft also said that next year it will offer its Azure customers cloud services that run on the newest flagship chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Microsoft said it is testing GPT 4 – OpenAI’s most advanced model – on AMD’s chips.
“This is not something that’s displacing Nvidia,” said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies.
He said the Maia chip would allow Microsoft to sell AI services in the cloud until personal computers and phones are powerful enough to handle them.
“Microsoft has a very different kind of core opportunity here because they’re making a lot of money per user for the services,” Bajarin said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Microsoft’s second chip announced Tuesday is designed to be both an internal cost saver and an answer to Microsoft’s chief cloud rival, Amazon Web Services.
Named Cobalt, the new chip is a central processing unit (CPU) made with technology from Arm Holdings. Microsoft disclosed on Wednesday that it has already been testing Cobalt to power Teams, its business messaging tool.
But Microsoft’s Guthrie said his company also wants to sell direct access to Cobalt to compete with the “Graviton” series of in-house chips offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
“We are designing our Cobalt solution to ensure that we are very competitive both in terms of performance as well as price-to-performance (compared with Amazon’s chips),” Guthrie said.

AWS will hold its own developer conference later this month, and a spokesman said that its Graviton chip now has 50,000 customers.
“AWS will continue to innovate to deliver future generations of AWS-designed chips to deliver even better price-performance for whatever customer workloads require,” the spokesman said after Microsoft announced its chip.
Microsoft gave few technical details that would allow gauging the chips’ competitiveness versus those of traditional chipmakers. Rani Borkar, corporate vice president for Azure hardware systems and infrastructure, said both are made with 5-nanometer manufacturing technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
She added that the Maia chip would be strung together with standard Ethernet network cabling, rather than a more expensive custom Nvidia networking technology that Microsoft used in the supercomputers it built for OpenAI. “You will see us going a lot more the standardization route,” Borkar told Reuters.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/microsoft-introduces-its-own-chips-for-ai-with-eye-on-cost-9028614/,technology

Comets bouncing from one planet to another can spread life in the universe,"Comets that ""bounced"" from one planet to another could carry the building blocks of life finds a new study.","How did Earth happen to have the molecular precursors that are the building blocks of life? One theory suggests that they may have been delivered here by comets. Researchers have now shown how comets could deposit similar building blocks to other planets in the galaxy by “bouncing” from one to another.
If a comet is to deliver any organic material, it has to be travelling quite slowly—around 15 kilometres per second, which is slow for comets. At speeds higher than that, those building block molecules will break apart with the temperature and speed of impact. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, astronomers from the University of Cambridge theorise that the most likely place for that to happen is in “peas in a pod” systems.

"Microsoft, Google will not challenge EU gatekeeper status",The Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires these gatekeepers to inter-operate their messaging apps with competitors and allow users to decide which apps they pre-install on their devices.,"Microsoft and Google will not challenge an EU law requiring them to make it easier for users to move between competing services such as social media platforms and internet browsers.
As part of its latest crackdown on Big Tech, the European Union in September picked 22 “gatekeeper” services, run by six of the world’s biggest tech companies, to face new rules.
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires these gatekeepers to inter-operate their messaging apps with competitors and allow users to decide which apps they pre-install on their devices.

The DMA will apply to services from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance.

Those disagreeing with the label and its requirements have until Nov. 16 to take their complaint to the Luxembourg-based General Court, which deals with cases ranging from competition law to trade and the environment.
A Google spokesperson said it will not appeal the decision.
Alphabet’s Google has the highest number of services, including its Android operating system, maps and search, which will face tougher rules under the DMA.
ADVERTISEMENT
Google has adopted a strategy in recent years of working rather than fighting EU regulators, and it would be hard for the company to win as it is the dominant player, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Companies such as Zalando and Amazon have challenged the Digital Services Act (DSA), seen as a companion legislation to the DMA, which imposes greater responsibilities on tech firms for the content shared on their sites.
Amazon, which had previously said it will continue to work constructively with the European Commission, declined comment.

“We accept our designation as a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act and will continue to work with the European Commission to meet the obligations imposed on Windows and LinkedIn under the DMA,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.

Industry sources told Reuters that other companies such as TikTok and Meta could likely file challenges. Meta’s Facebook, Instagram, Marketplace, and WhatsApp qualified as gatekeepers.
Meta and TikTok declined to comment.
TikTok earlier said that it fundamentally disagreed with the gatekeeper designation.
Apple, which Bloomberg News reported on Friday is also likely to challenge its designation, did not respond to requests for comment.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/microsoft-google-will-not-challenge-eu-gatekeeper-status-9027217/,technology
European firms urge China to give more clarity on data transfer laws,"The world's second-largest economy has in recent years tightened its data laws amid President Xi Jinping's increased focus on national security, and foreign firms fear their lack of clarity could trip them up.","European firms “urgently” need China to give clearer definitions of key terms in its cross-border data transfer rules, a European business lobby group said on Wednesday, warning that firms also stood to waste millions of euros storing non-sensitive data in China.
The European Chamber of Commerce in China called on authorities to “provide precise definitions for both “important data” and “personal information”, as outlined in their rules, and also urged that a proposed relaxation of certain aspects of regulations announced in September be finalised as soon as possible.
The world’s second-largest economy has in recent years tightened its data laws amid President Xi Jinping’s increased focus on national security, and foreign firms fear their lack of clarity could trip them up.

“Many of the laws, guidelines and measures lack specificity, which poses serious operational and compliance challenges to European companies operating in China,” the report read, adding requirements like “regulatory security assessment thresholds” were too low, “especially for larger multinational companies.”

Jitters among foreign investors in China have risen over the past year due to a series of corporate raids, predominantly on consultancies and due diligence firms.
The chamber’s report echoes recent comments from a European Commission official, who said in September that European businesses were especially concerned about a lack of clarity in China’s data laws.
China in the same month also said it was considering waiving data export security assessments for activities such as international trade, academic cooperation, cross-border manufacturing and marketing that do not contain personal information or important data, a move that was welcomed by foreign business chambers and lawyers.

“The release of the draft … was seen as a signal from the Chinese Government that it is listening to businesses’ concerns and is ready to take steps to address them. Companies are waiting eagerly for these positive signals to be translated into action,” the chamber said.
The most common type of data European firms transfer abroad is employee’s personal information followed by suppliers’ and customers’ personal information, the survey showed, 96% of which is sent to companies’ headquarters and other regional offices.
A third of companies indicated it would cost them “several million euros” to store their data in China if they failed the cross-border transfer security assessment now required by CAC. More than 10 percent of firms said it would cost them “hundreds of millions of euros.”
Only 6% of respondents indicated that they transferred ‘important data’ overseas, the chamber said.

"Australia says hacks surging, state-sponsored groups targeting critical infrastructure","Reports of cybercrime surged 23% to more than 94,000 in the financial year to June, the Australian Cyber Security Centre said in its annual threat report on Wednesday.","State-sponsored cyber groups and hackers have increased assaults on Australia’s critical infrastructure, businesses and homes, a government report said, adding that its new defence agreement with Britain and the U.S. had likely made it more of a target.
Reports of cybercrime surged 23% to more than 94,000 in the financial year to June, the Australian Cyber Security Centre said in its annual threat report on Wednesday.
It estimated there was a hack on Australian assets every six minutes.

“The cyber threat continues to grow,” Defence Minister Richard Marles told ABC Radio. “We’re also seeing a greater interest from state actors in Australia’s critical infrastructure.”
Also Read | Alphabet CEO, in Play store trial, acknowledges some materials not retained
The report said that was party due to the new AUKUS defence partnership “with its focus on nuclear submarines and other advanced military capabilities”.
In May, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and Microsoft said a state-sponsored Chinese hacking group was spying on U.S. critical infrastructure organisations. The U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK make up the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network.
Techniques used by the China hacking group could be used against Australia’s critical infrastructure including telecommunications, energy and transportation, the report said.

Marles said Australia’s relationship with China, its largest trading partner, was “complex” and the government had never pretended the relationship would be easy. Diplomatic and trade ties between the two countries have stabilised recently after several disputes since 2020.
“We value, clearly, a productive relationship with China … but China has been a source of security anxiety for our country and we prepare for that as well,” Marles said.
The spike in cyber intrusions prompted the government in February to set up an agency to help coordinate responses to hacks. It is also overhauling federal cyber laws – details of which are due to be released next week – and the government has said it will make it compulsory for companies to report ransomware incidents.
The average cost of a cybercrime to its victim rose 14%, the report said.

“This sort of evidence gives the government the requirement to have a much closer relationship between industry and government,” said Matthew Warren, director of the RMIT University Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation.
“Some of the statistics are quite frightening.”
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission also said this week that a survey of 700 companies had found 44% did not manage risks associated with third parties like supply chain partners accessing confidential data. It also found that 58% had limited or no measure to protect confidential data and 33% had no cyber incident response plan.
Cyber attacks against Australia will continue to rise until organisations started putting more effort into security and the risk management of their information assets, said Nigel Phair, cybersecurity professor at Monash University.
This month, a cyber incident at DP World Australia, one of the country’s largest ports operators, forced it to suspend operations for three days.

China receives US equipment to make advanced chips despite new rules,"The finding comes as the United States scrambles to figure out how Chinese telecoms giant Huawei was able to produce an advanced 7 nanometer chip to power its Mate 60 Pro smartphone at China's top chipmaker SMIC, despite the export curbs announced last year.","Chinese companies are buying up U.S. chipmaking equipment to make advanced semiconductors, despite a raft of new export curbs aimed at thwarting advances in the country’s semiconductor industry, a report said on Tuesday.
The 741 page annual report, released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, takes aim at the Biden administration’s Oct. 2022 export curbs, which seek to bar Chinese chipmakers from getting U.S. chipmaking tools if they would be used to manufacture advanced chips at the 14 nanometer node or below.
With the Commerce Department using the 14 nanometer restriction limit, “importers are often able to purchase the equipment if they claim it is being used on an older production line, and with limited capacity for end-use inspections, it is difficult to verify the equipment is not being used to produce more advanced chips,” the report stated.

Huawei and SMIC were also added to a trade restriction list in 2019 and 2020, which in theory bars U.S. suppliers from shipping certain technology to the companies.
China watchers had theorized that SMIC could have made the chip with equipment obtained prior to the October 2022 rules, but it had other options for obtaining the equipment from oversees, the report shows.
The United States managed to plug a key loophole in its efforts to stymie China’s access to advanced chipmaking tools by convincing allies Japan and the Netherlands, with similarly robust chipmaking equipment industries, to announce their own restrictions on exports of the coveted technology.
ADVERTISEMENT
But China stockpiled equipment by taking advantage of the lagtime between the United States’ October 2022 rules, and Japan and the Netherlands’ similar moves in July and September of 2023 respectively, the report details.
According to the document, between January and August 2023, China imported $3.2 billion (RMB 23.5 billion) worth of semiconductor manufacturing machines from the Netherlands, a 96.1% increase over the $1.7 billion (RMB 12 billion) recorded over the same period in 2022. China’s imports of semiconductor equipment from all countries totaled $13.8 billion (RMB 100 billion) over the first eight months of 2023, it added.
The report does not outline a specific recommendation to address the gaps in the U.S. rules, but urges Congress to request an annual evaluation, to be completed within 6 months by the General Accountability Office and later made public, of the effectiveness of export controls on chipmaking equipment to China.
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission was created in 2000 to submit an annual report to Congress on the national security implications of the economic ties between the United States and China, and to provide recommendations for government action.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/china-receives-us-equipment-to-make-advanced-chips-despite-new-rules-report-9027184/,technology

"Alphabet CEO, in Play store trial, acknowledges some materials not retained",Epic Games has alleged in its lawsuit that app store policies amount to an illegal monopoly and have caused consumers to pay artificially high prices.,"Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged in federal court on Tuesday that he sometimes marked documents as “privileged” and never turned off a setting that caused internal chats to delete automatically after one day.
Pichai was in court in San Francisco to defend Alphabet’s Google from a lawsuit by Epic Games that alleges its app store policies amount to an illegal monopoly and have caused consumers to pay artificially high prices.
Attorneys for Epic Games, maker of the wildly popular “Fortnite” game, appeared to be trying to establish that Pichai and Google were concealing sensitive communications that could later be used against it in a potential trial.

Jurors were shown an internal Google document reminding employees that “anything you write can become subject to review in legal discovery” as well as one of Pichai’s chat histories where he requested that history be turned off, meaning messages would be erased.

“I supported all recommendations from our legal and compliance team,” Pichai said during roughly an hour of testimony led by Epic’s lawyer. He largely stuck to one-word answers but was occasionally admonished by Epic Games’ attorney for straying beyond simple answers.
Pichai, in examination by a Google attorney, denied he had ever tried to keep any document hidden from a lawsuit. He said he used the term “privileged” on documents to indicate “confidential” not necessarily subject to attorney-client privilege.
But he later acknowledged, under questioning from the judge, that since 2008 Google largely left it to employees to determine if their chats could be relevant to litigation. He said that policy was revised recently.

Epic Games has alleged in its lawsuit that app store policies amount to an illegal monopoly and have caused consumers to pay artificially high prices. The company wants it to be easier for Google Play users to access third-party app stores and additional payment processors for in-app purchases.
For its part, Google has said changing its systems would cause its Android-based app store to be less secure and damage its ability to compete with Apple. Epic’s similar lawsuit against Apple resulted in a ruling largely that was mostly favorable to Apple – both companies appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Epic filed the case against Google in 2020 after “Fortnite” was removed from the app store after the Cary, North Carolina, company enabled customers to pay it directly, circumventing Google’s payment systems, which allow it to take a percentage of each transaction.
If jurors find for Epic it could radically alter the app store business, in which Google and Apple exert exclusive control of what apps are available to consumers and take a cut of roughly 30% of in-app purchases and paid downloads.

Google has settled claims over its app store with dating app maker Match Group and from U.S. consumers and U.S. states. Google is also facing an antitrust trial over the U.S. government’s allegations about its search dominance and is expected to have to defend itself at trial next year over its policies on digital advertising.
Separately, Pichai confirmed that Google pays Apple 36% of search revenue on iOS in order to be the default search engine, a figure that leaked on Monday in Google’s antitrust trial under way in federal court in Washington, D.C.
The payments to Apple have been central to the Justice Department’s case.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/alphabet-ceo-in-play-store-trial-acknowledges-some-materials-not-retained-9027171/,technology
‘AI’ is Collins Dictionary Word of the year 2023,"The Collins Dictionary has chosen AI, or artificial intelligence, as its Word of the Year 2023. Here are some of the others that made it to the shortlist.","A few years back, if you mentioned the acronym “AI” in common parlance, you would have had to be explaining that you are referring to artificial intelligence. Fast forward to 2023 and that is far from the case. You speak about AI and you will enter a conversation with someone who is a little scared about losing their job to a machine. And perhaps that is why the Collins dictionary chose “AI” as its word of the year for 2023.
The dictionary describes AI as “the modelling of human mental functions by computer programs.” It is perhaps only natural that AI was the word selected this year. Ever since ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, online searches for AI have surged. The AI market is projected to grow by nearly 800 per cent to around $1.8 trillion, according to the World Economic Forum.

Between November 11 and November 25, the Sun will be in between Earth and Mars. The phenomenon is called Mars solar conjunction and it happens once every two years. The space agency is pausing communication because Sun expels hot, ionised gas from its corona and there is a chance that could corrupt radio signals sent from Earth to Mars. This could cause unexpected behaviour from the spacecraft on Mars.

"The smartphone might be going away into AI-driven, screen-less oblivion",Humane AI Pin gives us a direction on where the world of personal technology could be headed.,"The future of the smartphone might not be another smartphone, even if it bends or folds or can be wrapped around your wrist. The future of the smartphone will most probably be one in which the personal computing device that we have all held close to our hearts, quite literally, hides itself from plain sight. While top tech companies have been moving in this direction for years, the biggest step towards a post-smartphone world happened last week when Humane announced its AI Pin. The Humane AI Pin does everything a smartphone does, but actually does more, without being a smartphone that you hold in your hand, and presents a six-inch display for you to fiddle with.
The first time I got a hint about the smartphone taking the back seat was in 2015 when a conversation with a top tech company executive drifted towards how voice commands can tackle most of the smartphone functions. This was way before Alexa had become a thing and the closest we had to what we were speaking of was Siri.

Nvidia upgrades flagship chip to handle bigger AI systems,Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips and powers OpenAI's ChatGPT service and many similar generative AI services that respond to queries with human-like writing.,"Nvidia on Monday added new features to its top-of-the-line chip for artificial intelligence, saying the new offering will start to roll out next year with Amazon.com, Alphabet’s Google and Oracle.
The H200, as the chip is called, will overtake Nvidia’s current top H100 chip. The primary upgrade is more high-bandwidth memory, one of the costliest parts of the chip that defines how much data it can process quickly.
Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips and powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT service and many similar generative AI services that respond to queries with human-like writing. The addition of more high-bandwidth memory and a faster connection to the chip’s processing elements means that such services will be able to spit out an answer more quickly.

The H200 has 141-gigabytes of high-bandwidth memory, up from 80 gigabyte in its previous H100. Nvidia did not disclose its suppliers for the memory on the new chip, but Micron Technology said in September that it was working to become an Nvidia supplier.
Nvidia also buys memory from Korea’s SK Hynix, which said last month that AI chips are helping to revive sales.

Amazon cuts games unit jobs in broader restructuring,"The company began informing employees Monday morning that their roles had been eliminated, in the second cut to the division this year.","Amazon.com has cut around 180 jobs in its games division, at least the second round of layoffs in under a week by the online retailer and digital streaming provider in a broader restructuring, an email viewed on Monday by Reuters showed.
“After our initial restructuring in April, it became clear that we needed to focus our resources even more on the areas that are growing with the highest potential to drive our business forward,” said Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games, in the Nov. 13 email.
The company began informing employees Monday morning that their roles had been eliminated, in the second cut to the division this year.

The games division offers downloadable versions of many video games, on a monthly rotation, as well as some Twitch channels and other services. The company remains focused on developing and publishing games such as “Blue Protocol” and the free games offered within Prime Gaming, it said.
Prime Gaming is a perk offered as part of the $139 annual Prime membership that includes free shipping and free streaming video.
“We’ve listened to our customers and we know delivering free games every month is what they want most, so we are refining our Prime benefit to increase our focus there,” Hartmann said.

In April, Amazon cut about 100 jobs in the games unit.
Amazon’s third-quarter net income far surpassed analysts’ estimates and the Seattle-based company forecast revenue in the year’s final quarter roughly in line with expectations.
Amazon has cut more than 27,000 roles over the past year, part of a wave of U.S. tech layoffs after the industry hired too many people during the pandemic.
Hartmann, in his email, said the company is “actively recruiting” for other roles in the division.

Adopted recently, the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) requires 19 very large online platforms and 2 very large online search engines, among them Google, X, TikTok, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft, to do more to tackle illegal and harmful content on their platforms.

"To keep Gaganyaan crew module upright after splashdown, ISRO plans tests in 2024",The TV-D1 mission was part of preparations for ISRO’s first human spaceflight Gaganyaan mission scheduled in 2024-25.,"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will conduct an experiment in a crew module to ensure it remains upright after splashing down in the sea.
The basic crew module in the TV-D1 mission on October 21 this year turned upside down while being recovered by naval divers in the Bay of Bengal. The TV-D1 mission was part of preparations for ISRO’s first human spaceflight Gaganyaan mission scheduled in 2024-25.
The uprighting system is among multiple systems to be tested during the second test mission (TV-D2) scheduled next year before a full-fledged unmanned test flight into space for the crew module on the LVM3 rocket part of the Gaganyaan mission, said TV-D1 mission director S Sivakumar.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The two stable positions are upright and upside down. Now, to avoid the upside-down situation in the real crew module, there will be an uprighting system that will be like gaseous balloons – similar to airbags in cars,” Sivakumar said.
“If the crew module is going to topple, the balloon system will restore the upright position. In this particular crew module, we wanted to see if it could remain stable. We found that when there is a lateral wind and disturbance due to sea waves it becomes unstable, and so it was near an upside-down position,” he said.
The crew module will also have redundancy systems to compensate for the failure of the primary crew module uprighting system, he said. “The recovery aids like the beacons had to work well underwater and the sea water dye should get ejected to mark the region of the landing,” he said.
“We are targeting the next test vehicle mission sometime in the first quarter of next year. The crew module with the control systems will simulate crew seat systems and suspension systems, the uprighting system etc. Also in the crew escape system we will use both low and high altitude escape motors unlike in D1 where we have used only the high altitude escape motors,” Sivakumar said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sivakumar said that the first test of the crew module and crew escape system in the TV D1 mission has been deemed a success although all “three elements — the test vehicle, the crew escape system and the crew module are new.”
The TV-D1 mission’s biggest success was the deployment at a desired angle of the drogue chutes (which bring the crew module from a height of 17 km at a speed of 150m/sec to a height of 2.5 km from the surface of the sea at a speed of 63 m/sec) after the release of crew module from the escape system, he said.
“We have tried to generate some fundamental data. All the parachutes and crew escape system are newly designed for Gaganyaan,” said Sivakumar. After the TV-D1 mission, a second demonstration flight next year will involve a crew module that would more closely simulate the final one. “We will be simulating the crew seats, control and floatation system etc in the test vehicle D2 next year,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/to-keep-gaganyaan-crew-module-upright-after-splashdown-isro-plans-tests-in-2024-9024211/,technology
Under a Thousand: Hands down the best budget Bluetooth keyboard!,Getting a good Bluetooth keyboard from a top tech brand for about Rs 1000 has been considered about as likely as Iceland winning the cricket World Cup (notwithstanding their Twitter wit).,"Bluetooth keyboards have been a part of our lives for a few years now. We use them with tablets, with large screen displays or sometimes just as wireless accessories to our regular computers. While these wireless wonders have indeed become more affordable with the passage of time, getting a good Bluetooth keyboard from a top tech brand for about Rs 1000 has been considered about as likely as Iceland winning the cricket World Cup (notwithstanding their Twitter wit).

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) that came into force for most companies in May is a tough legislation that targets at the market clout of top technology companies and aims to make it easier for people to move between competing services.
The EU Commission had recently designated 22 services of major tech firms as “gatekeepers” of online services, requiring them to inter-operate their messaging apps with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.
Alphabet’s Google Search, Apple’s Safari, Amazon.com’s marketplace, Bytedance’s TikTok and Meta Platforms’ Facebook are among the services that come under the scope of the DMA.
Together with the Digital Services Act, which puts forth rules for user-targeting, data practices and data sharing with the regulators, the two regulations are expected to drive big changes at the platforms that come under their purview.

Founded by former Google employees Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, Character.AI allows people to chat with virtual versions of celebrities like Billie Eilish or anime characters, while creating their own chatbots and AI assistants. It is free to use, but offers subscription model that charges $9.99 a month for users who want to skip the virtual line to access a chatbot.
Character.AI’s chatbots, with various roles and tones to choose from, have appealed to users ages 18 to 24, who contributed about 60% of its website traffic, according to data from Similarweb. The demographic is helping the company position itself as the purveyor of more fun personal AI companions, compared to other AI chatbots from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard.
The company previously said its website had attracted 100 million monthly visits in the first six months since its launch.
Character.AI is also in talks to raise equity funding from venture capital investors, which could value the company at over $5 billion, sources said. In March, it raised $150 million in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz at $1 billion valuation.

The talks with Google are ongoing and terms of the deal could change, said the sources, who requested anonymity as the discussions are private.
Google has been investing in AI startups, including $2 billion for model maker Anthropic in the form of convertible notes, on top of its earlier equity investment. Anthropic uses Google’s cloud services as well as its latest version of TPUs.
That is part of a recent trend in which big tech cloud services providers are striking deals with AI companies to entice them to use certain cloud or hardware in the computer-intensive race to build models and serve consumers, including Microsoft investments in OpenAI and Google and Amazon’s bets on Anthropic.

“The Switch will enter its eighth year from March 2024 but we will continue to develop new titles without being bound by previous platform lifecycles,” Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told a strategy briefing.
The comments come a day after Nintendo reported it sold 6.84 million Switch units in the first six months of the financial year that started in April, a slight increase on the same period a year earlier.
Sales of first-party Switch games were the strongest of any year over that period other than 2020, Nintendo said, boosted by bumper titles such “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom”.
Nintendo also announced on Wednesday “Super Mario” creator Shigeru Miyamoto is developing a live action adaptation of the “Zelda” franchise.Games slated for release next year include “Mario vs. Donkey Kong” and “Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD”.

What Nintendo’s growing Hollywood ambitions tell us about its future,"Nintendo is developing a live-action film based on The Legend of Zelda, one of the company's oldest and most beloved franchises.","Nintendo wants a piece of Hollywood so much that it plans to release one movie every year, a move many in the industry see will help the company evolve into an entertainment powerhouse. This week’s announcement that the Big N is developing a live-action movie based on The Legend of Zelda may have taken everyone by surprise, but Nintendo is only doing what many had been anticipating for years: its IPs are a goldmine, and the company is finally ready to cash in on it. But the big question is how Nintendo’s growing ambitions in Hollywood benefit the Kyoto-based firm’s long-term goals and it’s already successful console business.
Earlier this year, Nintendo dabbled in the movie business with the Super Mario Bros. Movie, and no one would have thought the film would generate over $1.3 billion just through ticket sales. It became this year’s biggest box office hit, only later dethroned by Barbie. Although it received mixed reviews, the smash success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie gave Nintendo the confidence to push further into Hollywood.

"This techie applies to 5,000 jobs using AI, makes it to 20 interviews","Julian Joseph, a former Salesforce employee who was laid off twice in a year, tried a unique way to land interviews.","Ask a job seeker how difficult it is to find a job. There are endless cold emails, rounds and rounds of interviews.

Apple’s iOS 17.2 hints at feature to sideload apps from outside App Store,"An analysis of iOS 17.2 beta by 9to5Mac reveals that Apple might start allowing users to sideload apps from outside the App Store, which the European Union's Digital Markets Act demands.","Apple has already buckled under pressure from the European Union in the past—by switching the Lightning connector on its iPhones to the USB-C standard.

The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets a series of obligations for “gatekeepers” to ensure fair and open digital markets.

Galaxy like Milky Way detected in early universe could challenge our cosmic knowledge,"Scientists have discovered a galaxy with a ""bar"" in the early universe. This could mean that they will have to rewrite their understanding of how galaxies develop.","Until recently, it was believed that barred spiral galaxies like the Milky Way cannot be observed before the universe reached half of its current age of 13.8 billion years. But now, scientists have used the James Webb Space Telescope to discover the most distant barred spiral galaxy to date.
The massive distances in space work differently from how you probably imagine them. When a celestial object is a very far away, we observe it as it was in the past because light takes a lot of time to reach us. For example, if we are observing something a light-year away, we see it as it was a year ago because the light from it took a year to reach us.

Dyson Zone review: The heavy-duty headphone with a trick up its sleeve,Dyson’s designs have always stood out from the rest and evoked awe by design. It continues that pattern with the Zone.,"There is a look of surprise and mild shock on my house help’s face as she comes in one smoggy Noida morning. She has seen me with some weird gadgets over the past few years, but this one startled even her. I was listening to music on the Dyson Zone that morning, with the visor on. So, the reaction was not entirely unexpected.
Dyson’s designs have always stood out from the rest and evoked awe by design. The Zone is no different, and that is quite an achievement, to be able to rethink how a noise-cancelling headphone can look. This is a large over-the-ear headphone with very cushy ear cups and headband. What makes the headphones stand out is the size of the ear cups — extra large with perforation to accommodate the air filtration mechanism. To make use of this personal air purifier you have to attach the visor to the headphone, which then makes the purified air flow in front of your nose. This also completes the Bane-like look which is a head-turner for sure.

Scientists rediscover long-lost mammal in remote Indonesia mountains,"The species has only been scientifically recorded once before, by a Dutch botanist in 1961.","Scientists have rediscovered a long-lost species of mammal described as having the spines of a hedgehog, the snout of an anteater and the feet of a mole, in Indonesia’s Cyclops Mountains more than 60 years after it was last recorded.
Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna, named after British naturalist David Attenborough, was photographed for the first time by a trail camera on the last day of a four-week expedition led by Oxford University scientists.
Having descended from the mountains at the end of the trip, biologist James Kempton found the images of the small creature walking through the forest undergrowth on the last memory card retrieved from more than 80 remote cameras.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There was a great sense of euphoria, and also relief having spent so long in the field with no reward until the very final day,” he said, describing the moment he first saw the footage with collaborators from Indonesian conservation group YAPPENDA.
“I shouted out to my colleagues that were still remaining… and said ‘we found it, we found it’ – I ran in from my desk to the living room and hugged the guys.”
Echidnas share their name with a half-woman, half-serpent Greek mythological creature, and were described by the team as shy, nocturnal burrow-dwellers who are notoriously difficult to find.

“The reason it appears so unlike other mammals is because it is a member of the monotremes – an egg-laying group that separated from the rest of the mammal tree-of-life about 200 million years ago,” Kempton said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The species has only been scientifically recorded once before, by a Dutch botanist in 1961. A different echidna species is found throughout Australia and lowland New Guinea.
Kempton’s team survived an earthquake, malaria and even a leech attached to an eyeball during their trip. They worked with the local village Yongsu Sapari to navigate and explore the remote terrain of northeastern Papua.
The echidna is embedded in the local culture, including a tradition that states conflicts are resolved by sending one party to a disagreement into the forest to search for the mammal and another to the ocean to find a marlin, according to Yongsu Sapari elders cited by the university.
Both creatures were seen as so difficult to find that it would often take decades or a generation to locate them, but, once found, the animals symbolized the end of the conflict and a return to harmonious relationships.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/scientists-rediscover-long-lost-mammal-in-remote-indonesia-mountains-9021219/,technology

Satellite connectivity on smartphones explained: How soon will India get it?,Several smartphone brands are bringing satellite comms to mainstream 5G devices. Here’s how it works and why it matters for India’s connectivity.,"With the new iPhone 14, Apple has made a big deal about having satellite connectivity which lets you send SOS messages without WiFi or cell service. But how does it even work?
Basically, regular cell phones connect to towers on the ground. The closer you are to a tower, the more bars you see on your status bar and the better the service. Move too far away and you lose signal. But satellite phones beam signals up to satellites orbiting above Earth. Each satellite covers significantly more area than a single cell tower, meaning phones with satellite connectivity maintain connections better in remote places without ground towers nearby.
This is especially useful for emergencies in rural or disaster areas with limited cell infrastructure. The only catch is that satellite connectivity typically requires specialised hardware, specifically an antenna that can transmit to satellites and receive signals from them. But there’s an emerging technology that does away with the need for such hardware.
ADVERTISEMENT
What’s 5G-NTN?
This technology is 5G NTN, which stands for 5G Non-Terrestrial Network. It lets phones tap satellites for data when they can’t reach land-based 5G towers, helping users stay connected for sending messages, GPS, and voice and video calls.
Before, satellite phones were niche devices separate from regular cellular networks. But with standards like NR-NTN that companies like MediaTek are pushing, satellite comms can be built right into 5G smartphones – there’s no need for specialised hardware anymore.
The satellite connectivity space is heating up
Several leading smartphone brands showcased their latest advancements in satellite connectivity at Mobile World Congress 2023. This highlights how the industry is ramping up efforts to bring robust satellite communication capabilities to mainstream 5G smartphones.
MediaTek demonstrated its NR-NTN technology for two-way messaging via satellite on Android phones. It also revealed its next-generation NR-NTN for higher satellite data rates and expanded use cases. MediaTek already has commercial devices on the market integrating its satellite tech through partners like Motorola.
ADVERTISEMENT
Meanwhile, Qualcomm announced partnerships with Honor, Motorola, Nothing, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi to enable satellite messaging on premium phones equipped with its Snapdragon Satellite platform. Qualcomm’s solution supports connections with both geosynchronous and low-earth orbit satellites.
Samsung also unveiled an Exynos chipset with built-in satellite connectivity that can power smartphones and other devices. Their chip is capable of working with multiple satellite networks.
India’s satellite connectivity ecosystem
India is a huge potential market for satellite tech in phones. With remote terrain and developing infrastructure, satellites can help extend reliable connectivity.
Reliance Jio recently launched JioSpaceFiber, India’s first satellite broadband service promising fiber-optic like speeds. This leverages satellites to deliver reliable high-speed internet and entertainment to consumers and businesses everywhere.
ADVERTISEMENT
Airtel has partnered with OneWeb for a joint venture called Airtel OneWeb. They already received regulatory approval to offer satellite service in India. Airtel’s chairman predicts that OneWeb will start providing coverage across all of India as soon as next month.
Between progress on 5G rollout and satellite connectivity, India is taking steps to connect even its most remote regions. However, there are still challenges around factors like spectrum allocation, data security, pricing competition, and regulations that need to be worked through as satellite-linked smartphones develop in India. But the technology could help digitally empower people across the country through enhanced connectivity.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/satellite-connectivity-smartphones-how-it-works-india-9019052/,technology

Dinkinesh surprises NASA’s Lucy mission again: 3 asteroids instead of 1,"NASA's Lucy mission has unveiled another surprise from Dinkinesh. Dinkinesh is a total of three asteroids, not two.","The asteroid Dinkinesh already surprised astronomers once when NASA’s Lucy mission flew past it. What was thought to be a single asteroid turned out to be a binary system of two asteroids. The space agency on Tuesday said that one of those space rocks in a pair is in itself a contact binary. This means that the asteroid is not two but a total of three different space rocks.
A contact binary refers to two small separate objects that are touching each other. In the first images of Dinkinesh downloaded from the Lucy spacecraft, the two parts of the contact binary happened to be one behind another. This meant that it looked like there was only one “moon” there. After the Lucy team downlinked more images, some taken minutes after the encounter, they realised that it was actually another contact binary.

ISRO’s Aditya L1 captures X-ray glimpse of benign solar flare,"Other than the solar flare, the HEL1OS observation also detected evidence of these impulsive events that were seen weakly in the GEOS data.","While on its way to the L1 point to get an unobstructed view of the Sun, another scientific instrument on-board India’s first solar observatory Aditya-L1 was turned on at the end of last month.

The spacecraft that will travel 1 per cent of the distance to the Sun – the farthest of any India-made satellite – has been on its trajectory towards the L1 point for over six weeks. After exiting the Earth’s orbit in September, the spacecraft was to take around 110 days to reach the L1 point. “The spacecraft will start braking to get into the orbit around the L1 point in the first week of January,” an ISRO scientist said.

The supermassive black hole described in Nature Astronomy has about the same as the combined mass of the stars in the galaxy it resides in. Beyond its significance as the oldest known black hole, it also offers proof to suggest that the early universe is “seeded” with heavy black hole seeds with large birth masses that form from direct collapse, according to Yale University.
Direct collapse black holes
For a long time, it was believed that black holes could only form from “light seeds” that were created by the explosion of stars. But that theory had a “problem of timing.” The problem was that it did not leave enough time for black holes to grow into the sort of humongous sizes that astronomers are now able to observe really far back in time.

Priyamvada Natarajan, coauthor of the paper, came up with a different theory in 2006. She developed a new model where “heavy” black hole seeds could form in galaxies where star formation was suppressed. These are the satellite galaxies that are close to the galaxies that formed the first stars. In the model, large disks of gas in the satellite galaxies could collapse into heavy black hole seeds and then rapidly merge into their parent galaxies.
Discovered using two NASA telescopes
Fast forward to the present, and researchers combined data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope to look behind the galaxy Abel 2744. The massive galaxy was acting as a cosmic lens. Essentially, its massive gravity was bending the light coming from behind it in such a way that it was possible to see distant objects behind it better.
The newly-discovered black hole offers compelling evidence to suggest that Natarajan’s theory that black hole seeds are produced through multiple different scenarios.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/oldest-discovered-black-hole-quasar-9017403/,technology
"For Delhi’s post-Diwali smog woes, here are 6 gadgets for breathing easier",Showers in Delhi only brought temporary relief as the AQI level in the city has shot up once again post Diwali. But you don't have to suffer: Check out these awesome gadgets that will help you breathe better.,"Air quality in India is exceptionally bad at the moment, and it’s worsening in Delhi post-Diwali. The short spell of showers only brought temporary relief as the smog in the capital city has once again gotten so thick that the air quality index (AQI) has shot above 300, which lies in the “very poor” category. Other Indian cities have also seen their air quality levels dip around this time period.
When air quality sinks this low, it’s crucial to take steps to protect your health whether you’re outdoors or just hanging at home. Kids, the elderly, and those with respiratory issues are vulnerable to pollutants in the air. Luckily, there are some neat gadgets you can snag to help filter out the junk you’d rather not be breathing. Here’s a look at some of the top options for combating air pollution.
Air purifiers for home

Air purifiers should be considered an absolute essential during intense pollution episodes, as they remove fine particles, allergens, smells and harmful gases from the air inside your home. These come with HEPA filters that do a great job at capturing particulate matter and pollutants, giving you cleaner air to breathe indoors. You can find air purifiers ranging from Rs 6,000 to Rs 50,000 and up, but here are some of the best affordable options for your first purchase:

Meta bars political advertisers from using generative AI ads tools,"Meta narrowly bans misleading AI-generated video in all content, including organic non-paid posts, with an exception for parody or satire.","Facebook owner Meta is barring political campaigns and advertisers in other regulated industries from using its new generative AI advertising products, a company spokesperson said on Monday, denying access to tools that lawmakers have warned could turbo-charge the spread of election misinformation.
Meta publicly disclosed the decision in updates posted to its help center on Monday night, following publication of this story. Its advertising standards prohibit ads with content that have been debunked by the company’s fact-checking partners but do not have any rules specifically on AI.
“As we continue to test new Generative AI ads creation tools in Ads Manager, advertisers running campaigns that qualify as ads for Housing, Employment or Credit or Social Issues, Elections, or Politics, or related to Health, Pharmaceuticals or Financial Services aren’t currently permitted to use these Generative AI features,” the company said in a note appended to several pages explaining how the tools work.

“We believe this approach will allow us to better understand potential risks and build the right safeguards for the use of Generative AI in ads that relate to potentially sensitive topics in regulated industries,” it said.

The policy update comes a month after Meta – the world’s second-biggest platform for digital ads – announced it was starting to expand advertisers’ access to AI-powered advertising tools that can instantly create backgrounds, image adjustments and variations of ad copy in response to simple text prompts.
The tools were initially made available only to a small group of advertisers starting in the spring. They are on track to roll out to all advertisers globally by next year, the company said at the time.
Meta and other tech companies have raced to launch generative AI ad products and virtual assistants in recent months in response to the frenzy over the debut last year of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, which can provide human-like written responses to questions and other prompts.
ADVERTISEMENT
The companies have released little information so far about the safety guard rails they plan to impose on those systems, making Meta’s decision on political ads one of the industry’s most significant AI policy choices to come to light to date.
Alphabet’s Google, the biggest digital advertising company, announced the launch of similar image-customizing generative AI ads tools last week. It plans to keep politics out of its products by blocking a list of “political keywords” from being used as prompts, a Google spokesperson told Reuters.
Google has also planned a mid-November policy update to require that election-related ads must include a disclosure if they contain “synthetic content that inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events.”
TikTok and Snapchat owner Snap both bar political ads, while X, previously known as Twitter, has not rolled out any generative AI advertising tools.
ADVERTISEMENT
Meta’s top policy executive, Nick Clegg, said last month that the use of generative AI in political advertising was “clearly an area where we need to update our rules.”

He warned ahead of a recent AI safety summit in the UK that governments and tech companies alike should prepare for the technology to be used to interfere in upcoming elections in 2024, calling for special focus on election-related content “that moves from one platform to the other.”
Earlier, Clegg told Reuters that Meta was blocking its user-facing Meta AI virtual assistant from creating photo-realistic images of public figures. Meta committed this summer to developing a system to “watermark” content generated by AI.
Meta narrowly bans misleading AI-generated video in all content, including organic non-paid posts, with an exception for parody or satire.

"Elon Musk’s X restructuring curtails disinformation research, spurs legal fears",Musk's restrictions on critical methods of gathering data on the global platform have suppressed the ability to untangle the origin and spread of false information during real-time events such as Hamas' attack on Israel and the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.,"Social media researchers have canceled, suspended or changed more than 100 studies about X, formerly Twitter, as a result of actions taken by Elon Musk that limit access to the social media platform, nearly a dozen interviews and a survey of planned projects show.
Musk’s restrictions on critical methods of gathering data on the global platform have suppressed the ability to untangle the origin and spread of false information during real-time events such as Hamas’ attack on Israel and the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, researchers told Reuters.
The most important method was a tool that gave researchers access to data about 10 million tweets per month. Twitter notified researchers in February it would end free academic access to this application programming interface (API) as part of an overhaul of the tool, according to an email seen by Reuters.
ADVERTISEMENT
The survey of 167 academic and civil society researchers conducted at Reuters’ request by the Coalition for Independent Technology Research in September quantifies for the first time the number of studies that have been cancelled due to Musk’s policies.

It also shows a majority of survey respondents fear being sued by X over their findings or use of data. The worry follows X’s July lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after it published critical reports about the platform’s content moderation.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment and an X representative declined to comment. The company has previously said that nearly all content views are of “healthy” posts.
Musk’s first year of ownership of X has been marked by advertisers fleeing the site, concerned that their ads could appear next to harmful content. X’s U.S. ad revenue declined at least 55% year-over-year each month since Musk’s acquisition, Reuters previously reported.
ADVERTISEMENT
The survey showed 30 canceled projects, 47 stalled projects and 27 where researchers changed platforms. It also revealed 47 ongoing projects, though some researchers noted that their ability to collect fresh data would be limited.
The affected studies include research on hate speech and topics that have garnered global regulatory scrutiny. In one example, a stalled project sought to study child safety on X. The platform was recently fined by an Australian regulator for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.
The researcher for the stalled project and several others who responded to the Coalition’s survey requested to remain anonymous. An author of the survey said researchers may seek to avoid backlash from X or protect ongoing studies.
European Union regulators are also currently investigating X’s handling of disinformation, which was the focus of multiple stalled or canceled independent research studies, the survey found.
ADVERTISEMENT
The reduced ability to study the platform “makes users on (X) vulnerable to more hate speech, more misinformation and more disinformation,” said Josephine Lukito, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
She helped conduct the research survey for the coalition, a global group with more than 300 members, that works to advance the study of technology’s impact on society.
The survey was sent in mid-September by email to the coalition’s members as well as email lists for other academic groups, such as experts focused on political communication or social media.
The EU’s investigation of X, under new strict internet rules that took effect in August, underscore the potential regulatory threat to the San Francisco-based company. Any violation could result in fines of up to 6% of global revenue.
ADVERTISEMENT
An EU Commission spokesperson said it is currently monitoring X’s, as well as other large platforms’, compliance with the law’s obligations, which includes allowing researchers who meet certain conditions to gain access to publicly available data.

UNAFFORDABLE COST
Before Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion, a large proportion of studies about social media had been related to Twitter, because the platform was a valuable source of information about politics and current events. Its data was easily accessible, four researchers told Reuters.
But almost from the moment Musk stepped into Twitter’s headquarters, he began slashing costs and laying off thousands of employees, including those who worked on the research tools.
Now, X offers three paid tiers of the API ranging from $100 to $42,000 per month, and the lower-priced tiers provide less data than what was available to researchers for free previously. Nearly every researcher who spoke with Reuters said they could not afford the costs.
ADVERTISEMENT
One former employee, who declined to be named for fear of backlash from Musk, said the decision to shut down free academic API access came down to an urgent need to focus on boosting revenue and cutting costs in the aftermath of Musk’s takeover.
A majority of survey respondents cited the API changes as the reason for canceling or pausing their studies about the platform.
The unaffordable cost of paying to receive less data than what was available previously means research ahead of 2024, a major election year globally, is severely challenged, Lukito said.
Tim Weninger, a professor of engineering at University of Notre Dame, said his team has been “flying blind” while trying to track China-linked information operations without data from the API, the cost of which is prohibitive, he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Several researchers told Reuters they now have limited options to study X, such as manually analyzing posts.
Researchers also face limitations in gathering data from other social platforms. Short-form video app TikTok announced an academic research API earlier this year, but its onerous terms and conditions limit its usefulness for researchers, said Megan A. Brown, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, in a blog post she wrote for Tech Policy Press while a researcher at New York University.
Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta Platforms has partnered with external researchers on studies, which is not a substitute for independent research, but shows Meta’s willingness to collaborate, Lukito said.
LEGAL CONCERNS
The CCDH, an organization that said it aims to fight hate speech and disinformation, published several reports after Musk’s acquisition that claimed the social media platform failed to moderate and also profited from harmful content.
ADVERTISEMENT
X sued CCDH in July, accusing the organization of improperly accessing data from the platform and promoting false claims about X’s moderation.
“Musk wants to silence any criticism of the way he does business,” said CCDH Chief Executive Imran Ahmed, adding CCDH stood by its reports.
In the survey from the Coalition for Independent Technology Research, 104 out of 167 respondents cited the possibility of legal action due to either their use of data or their research findings as a concern about their projects.
“The move against the CCDH communicates to researchers looking at misinformation and hate speech on online platforms that there is intrinsic liability in publicly disseminating findings,” said Bond Benton, an associate professor at Montclair State University, which produced a study last year that found hate speech increased on Twitter in the hours after Musk’s takeover.
ADVERTISEMENT
One researcher, who declined to be named, was studying how the subject of rape is discussed on X and told the survey they were worried about legal risk and the scientific validity of data collected without access to the API. The researcher said they moved the study to examine a different social media platform.
Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino have articulated a new policy called “freedom of speech, not reach” that restricts the distribution of some posts but refrains from deleting them from the platform.
X has said 99% of content that users see on the platform is “healthy,” which the company attributed in July to estimates from Sprinklr, a software company that helps brands monitor market trends and customer sentiment online.
A spokesperson for Sprinklr, which is listed as an official partner of Twitter, declined to confirm the figures cited in the July post after Reuters requested comment and said “any recent external reporting prepared by Twitter/X has been done without Sprinklr’s involvement.”
The spokesperson pointed to a March blog post that said toxic posts on X received three-times fewer views than non-toxic posts.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/elon-musks-x-restructuring-curtails-disinformation-research-spurs-legal-fears-9016737/,technology

To be sure, Indian authorities are encouraging installation of charging infrastructure, and each state has its own guidelines: Delhi, for example, requires 20% of parking spots to be reserved for EVs, while Uttar Pradesh, which has the most EV registrations, mandates all new housing complexes above 5,000 square metres to have at least one EV charging unit.
“No matter how fast public charging is, you need to go there, stop there to get the charging done, while in home-charging, you plug it in and your EV is fully charged overnight,” said Ravneet Phokela, Chief Business Officer of energy firm Ather Energy.

Assistants API: This new API helps developers in building ‘agent-like experiences’ within their applications. It allows developers to create assistants with specific instructions using generative AI models for tasks such as data analysis, coding, etc. It is backed by Code Interpreter, OpenAI’s in-house tool that writes and runs codes.
GPT-4 Turbo: The new GPT-4 turbo comes with a 128,000-token context window. It is to be noted that Claude 2 from Anthropic has a 100,000 token limit. The GPT-4 Turbo can accept images as part of the prompt and can generate human-quality speech as its output. The GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions – a strictly text-analysing version and another that comprehends both text and images.

"Meet Angry Pumpkins: A game made using ChatGPT, DALL-E 3 and MidJourney","Angry Pumpkins is a game made by a single person in about 10-12 hours using popular AI tools like Midjourney, ChatGPT and DALL-E 3.","The use of artificial intelligence-powered chatbots and services has skyrocketed in the last few months, with people using the technology to create all sorts of things from courses to images to programs.
Now, a user on X named Javi Lopez seems to have made a video game called ‘Angry Pumpkins’, which resembles the popular 2010 title ‘Angry Birds’. The post indicates that the game was made from scratch using popular AI tools like Midjourney, ChatGPT and DALL-E 3.
Midjourney, DALL•E 3 and GPT-4 have opened a world of endless possibilities.
I just coded “Angry Pumpkins 🎃” (any resemblance is purely coincidental 😂) using GPT-4 for all the coding and Midjourney / DALLE for the graphics.
Here are the prompts and the process I followed: pic.twitter.com/st3OEhVVtK
— Javi Lopez ⛩️ (@javilopen) October 31, 2023
Lopez said he used ChatGPT to generate an interactive version of the game, which resulted in 600 lines of code. He then tweaked the generated code and added additional details like particle effects and objects.
Midjourney was used to create objects, background images and characters and the intro screen was made using DALL-E 3, which also happens to power the Bing Image Creator. Lopez said players can make their own levels using instructions written at the bottom of the screen when playing the game.
ADVERTISEMENT
When asked about the amount of time it took to make the game, Lopez said it took him around 10-12 hours including the time it took to write the thread.
While AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Bing Search and Google Bard cannot make games using simple prompts, Angry Pumpkins gives us an idea of how the video game industry, which often requires millions of dollars to develop a single game can make use of popular tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney to cut down on costs as well as save time.

How Razer Anzu became my favourite pair of sunglasses and almost replaced my wireless earbuds,"Razer Anzu, unlike the conventional wireless earphones offer true ambience mode.","Ever since the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7, brands have been looking at offering wireless earphones in various form factors. While neckband and TWS are the two most popular formats, there is also a new kind of wireless audio device that’s picking up popularity, one that replaces sunglasses. One such product is the Razer Anzu.
I recently got hold of one, as it was available for just around Rs 4,000 on Amazon. Here is my experience with the Razer Anzu and how it differentiates itself from headphone neckbands, and TWS.
The Razer Anzu was originally launched in early 2021 for $200 or approximately Rs 15,000. At that price, the product did feel a bit expensive. However, it is now available at a much lower price, making these a great pair of affordable Bluetooth-enabled smart glasses.

The product came in a secure package and I liked how high quality the carry case feels, which is made out of faux leather. In fact, the Razer Anzu carry case feels more robust and premium than the case I got with more expensive Ray-Ban sunglasses.
Similarly, I also liked how there are no on/off buttons on the device. Open the temple to turn on the device and close the temple to turn it off. This reminded me of my MacBook Air. This simple feature makes using this sunglass a lot easier.
Razer audio offers more control over the Anzu (Image credit: Vivek Umashankar/The Indian Express)
There is an app to control various functions
As this is a smart device, of course, there is an app — Razer Audio, available for both Android and iOS devices. From fine-tuning the audio to updating the firmware, the app is very intuitive and easy to use. As this is a Razer product, there is even a gaming mode, which cuts down audio latency to an extent.
In my experience of using the Razer Anzu, I felt that the frame is slightly on the wider side, which makes me have to adjust it every once in a while. I could play music, attend meetings, and even take calls. For the first few instances, I did feel a bit of fatigue around the nose area and on the ears, as the frame is slightly on the thicker and heavier side. However, after using these smart glasses for a while, I didn’t feel much discomfort.

Ambience mode comes naturally to the Anzu (Image credit: Vivek Umashankar/The Indian Express)
The true ambience mode
Ambience mode is a feature that’s mostly found on high-end wireless earphones and headphones, which lets in-environment sound. As the Razer Anzu does not cover the ear, it is probably the best wireless personal audio device, which is very useful while walking on the streets or even while riding a cycle.
Also read | From Meta Quest 3 to Ray Ban Smart Glasses, here’s everything announced at Connect 2023
Do note that, depending on the external noise, sometimes the volume of the Razer Anzu might be insufficient. On top of that, these are also like open-back earphones, where, people around you can hear what’s playing, so, it’s certainly not meant for those, who like to keep conversations or their playlists private.
In closed environments like home and office, the Razer Anzu gets loud enough and it also offers good audio quality, again, if you are a bass head, you will be disappointed. And this is how the Razer Anzu became my favourite pair of wireless audio devices while walking or taking my scooter out, where, I could finally hear navigation from Google Maps and also stay vigilant about the surrounding.

The battery usually lasts for 4 to 5 hours per charge and it comes with a proprietary charging cable, where, if you forget it, you won’t be able to charge it and if you lose it, it’s really hard to find a replacement.

Overall, for the price that I paid for these smart glasses (not that smart though), I feel they are great at what they offer. In fact, you can buy a similar product for a lot less than what I paid on all the major e-commerce platforms.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/razr-anzu-smart-glasses-real-world-experience-9015369/,technology

Musk who has criticized Big Tech’s AI efforts as ridden with censorship, in July launched xAI, calling it a “maximum truth-seeking AI” that tries to understand the nature of the universe to rival Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing AI.
“Grok has real-time access to info via the X platform, which is a massive advantage over other models,” Musk added.
X, the social media firm formerly known as Twitter which Musk owns, is separate from xAI, but the companies work closely together. xAI also works with his electric car maker Tesla and other companies.

Watch this space: Dinkinesh’s space twin and how Jupiter could have killed Earth,"In the weeks leading up to Lucy’s encounter with Dinkinesh, teams at NASA had begun to have questions about whether Dinkinesh is a single binary system. This is because the asteroid’s brightness seemed to be changing over time.","Earlier this week, NASA’s Lucy mission, after travelling nearly 480 million kilometres away from our planet, was set to take pictures of what scientists believed was one asteroid—Dinkinesh. But when the spacecraft flew past the celestial body at over 16,000 kilometres per hour, scientists discovered that it was actually two celestial bodies.
As it turns out, the first asteroid that Lucy visited turned out to be its first two asteroids. What astronomers so far observed as a single asteroid turned out to be a binary pair of two space rocks. But how is that possible?",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/watch-this-space-dinkineshs-space-twin-and-jupiter-could-kill-earth-9014016/,technology
Hybrid CPUs are the future of personal computing: Here’s why we think so,Here is why PC-chip makers are bullish on hybrid CPUs.,"AMD just announced two new processors in the Ryzen 7040U lineup. While they may appear like a minor upgrade from their predecessors, this marks a drastic shift in the PC-chip-making industry, especially for laptop computers.
With the launch of Ryzen 5 7545U and Ryzen 3 7440U, the first set of PC chips from AMD featuring a hybrid CPU architecture featuring Zen4 and Zen4c cores, all the PC chip makers are embracing a hybrid CPU architecture to derive both performance and power efficiency on portable computers like laptops and notebooks.
What is hybrid CPU architecture, and why does it matter?
Hybrid CPU architecture has been in the industry for a while. In fact, smartphone chips are the first set of products that opted for this new standard, allowing smartphone makers to enhance battery life while also delivering stellar performance when needed.
ADVERTISEMENT
In simple words, a hybrid CPU architecture is nothing but a CPU cluster, which includes at least two different types of performance cores, commonly known as high-performance cores and efficiency cores. Depending on the brand, these go by different nomenclature, where, Intel calls it P and E cores, where, P stands for performance and E stands for efficiency.
The newly announced Ryzen 5 7545U has four CPU cores, with two high-performance cores based on Zen4 architecture and two efficiency cores based on Zen4c architecture. The Zen4c cores when compared to the Zen4 cores will be physically smaller, more power efficient, and offer slightly lower performance, and in most cases, efficiency cores also skip hyperthreading capability.
Similarly, the Ryzen 3 7440U has a single high-performance core based on Zen4 architecture and three efficiency cores built on top of Zen4c architecture.
We have similar solutions, featuring hybrid CPU architecture from all the major PC chip vendors, which includes Intel (starting with 12th Gen), Apple (M series), Qualcomm (Snapdragon X Elite), and now AMD (Ryzen 7040U) series.

Why hybrid CPU architecture is the future of personal computers?
We don’t always use our laptops for gaming or high computational workload, sometimes, all we do on our laptops is sit on a couch and binge-watch a web series or a movie on Prime Video or Netflix, and this is where the efficiency cores come into the picture.
While browsing the web, we don’t need those high-performance cores clocked at 4/5GHz, as they consume a lot of power and also heat up the device. For simple tasks like video streaming or web browsing, a low-performance core makes the perfect sense, where, it offers the limited computing capability required for that task while consuming the least amount of power.

This is why your gaming laptop, despite having a bigger battery than a thin-and-light notebook, does not last as long as an ultrabook, even when you are using the machine just to surf the web or for writing assignments, as these gaming laptops will depend on high-performance cores even for lighter tasks.
In fact, the upcoming 14th Gen Meteor Lake processors from Intel even have a third kind of super-efficient E cores, which will be primarily used for tasks like web browsing and video streaming to further improve power efficiency.

The same goes for the high-performance core, say, you are rendering a 3D model, or editing a 4K, where, the combination of high-performance and low-performance cores will fulfil the computing needs. Similarly, while gaming (most games still depend on peak single-core performance), a high-performance core can deliver processing capability.
For more efficient computing processes, along with hybrid CPUs, we also need software prowess, where the OS developers have to implement dynamic resource allocation, which Microsoft has been doing for a while, on Windows 11 with Thread Director, where a specific core is allocated for a task, depending on the requirement.
Similarly, developers also have to update their apps to make use of these new CPU architectures. With almost everyone being on the same page, especially when it comes to hybrid CPUs, upcoming laptops should be able to offer more performance and battery life at the same time.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/hybrid-cpus-future-of-personal-computing-ryzen-7040u-series-9013934/,technology

"From OnePlus 7 Pro to Xperia Z5 Premium, 5 discontinued flagships that are still worth buying in 2023","You won’t believe how good these 5 old phones look and perform in 2023. They’re discontinued, but not forgotten.","Phones these days are getting pretty much identical, with most brands chasing the same trends and features to the point that things have gotten a bit…boring? So if you find yourself longing for the golden age of smartphone innovation from just a few years ago, you’re not alone. Here are 5 now-discontinued smartphones from the late 2010s that are still worth it.
OnePlus 7 Pro

Launched back in 2019, the OnePlus 7 Pro is anything but outdated even in 2023. There are few phones today that look as futuristic as this one – the bezels are as slim as can be for when the phone launched and there’s no notch or even a punch hole to mess up the immersive full-screen viewing experience.
The front camera is cleverly tucked away in a pop-up module so it doesn’t get in the way of that gorgeous display. And yet even with such hardware, the Snapdragon 855-powered 7 Pro is still lighter than most new 2023 flagships at just 205 grams. You can’t buy the OnePlus 7 Pro new anymore since it’s discontinued, but you can still find refurbished models on reseller sites like Cashify for less than Rs 20k which is a steal.

Redmi K20 Pro

Dropping mere days after the OnePlus 7 Pro in 2019 was the legendary Redmi K20 Pro, another phone its loyal owners still swear by. This thing has stood the test of time remarkably well and the pop-up camera is even cooler than the 7 Pro’s – it lights up. Beyond the flashy front camera, the versatile triple camera system with 48MP primary, 8MP 2x telephoto and 13MP ultrawide lenses at the back still holds up.
2019 was truly an excellent vintage for flagship Android phones and if you want to revisit those glory days, you can buy the K20 Pro used online or visit your local offline phone shop. Considering how popular this model was, there’s a good chance they’ll have one in stock.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10

Yet another classic 2019 release was the Galaxy Note 10, the first Note to ditch the bezels for a gorgeous full-screen design. Samsung nailed it with this one – with a 91% screen-to-body ratio, the Note 10 still looks like it could’ve rolled off the production line for a 2023 Galaxy Unpack launch. Moreover, despite being a Note with its signature stylus, the screen is only 6.3 inches, making it surprisingly compact and pocketable for a phone you can scribble on.
Apple iPhone X

Going back a bit further to 2017, the revolutionary iPhone X was truly ahead of its time – Apple called it the “future of the smartphone” and they weren’t kidding considering how nearly every brand copied its futuristic bezel-less notched design soon after. The X was so far ahead that 6 years later, the latest iPhones still take after its iconic look.

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium

Lastly, the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium might not have had the best performance or heat management (thanks to the infamous Snapdragon 810), but it was arguably Sony’s last hoorah before its downfall. And the chrome colour version alone was to die for – an absolute fingerprint magnet but nothing screamed “premium” quite like its reflective shine.
Beyond the flashy exterior, the Z5 Premium stood out with its bonkers 2160 x 3840 4K display rocking a pixel density of 806 ppi. This thing never sold well, but if you’re a Sony fan and come across one used online, it’s the ultimate relic to relive their glory days.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/5-discontinued-flagships-worth-buying-in-2023-9013357/,technology

Rishi Sunak asks Elon Musk tough questions on AI: 6 key things discussed,Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk sat down for a candid conversation on AI. The duo discussed the potential and challenges of AI in the hour-long session.,"At a time when Artificial Intelligence is dominating the conversations around the world, what world leaders say could indicate how governments intend to treat the technology. Even as we witness some remarkable capabilities, some questions remain unanswered. The UK recently hosted the AI Safety Summit, and as part of the summit, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hosted Elon Musk for a Q and A session. 
The wide-ranging discussion saw Sunak and Musk speak on the need to balance AI’s potential and risks. The SpaceX chief shared his long-standing concerns on why the world should proceed cautiously when it came to developing AI technologies. The duo in the conversation also agreed on the significance of governments in overseeing public safety and the need for companies to collaborate in a responsible manner. 
The conversation also explored the benefits of AI in terms of education, productivity, economy and equal access. They also touched upon the challenges that loom large in combating misinformation caused by AI. The long discussion also saw the leaders expressing their optimism.

Here are key takeaways from the conversation between Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk:
Developing AI safely
Sunak opened the discussion by quoting Bill Gates, who once hailed Musk as someone who has done more to push the limits of science and innovation in our times. He went on to ask Musk to share his thoughts on how it felt to be held in such high regard by Gates. In his response, Musk quipped, “That’s a nice thing to have anyone say about you, especially coming from Bill Gates.”
He soon shifted his focus to AI, on which, for nearly a decade, he has been talking about how the world needs to practise caution with AI to make it safe. While sharing his earlier concerns, Musk also acknowledged the progress in AI, such as GPT-3, adding that there is a proactive need to mitigate potential risks. “I’m glad people are taking safety seriously now. I think this AI safety conference will go down in history as very important. The potential is there for AI to have a positive effect and create abundance, but there is a ‘genie problem’ – if you have a genie granting unlimited wishes, those stories don’t usually end well. We need to mitigate the downside potential,” he said. 
Governments as referee
Talking about the AI Safety Summit, Musk said that he felt it is good for governments to play an active role when it comes to public safety. With the rise of digital superintelligence, Musk said that there was a need for governments to play the role of ‘referee’ to make sure there is sportsman-like conduct and public safety concerns are addressed efficiently. He went on to say that he has been familiar with regulators in cars, aviation and rockets. While he agreed with most regulations, there were less than 1 per cent that he disagreed with.

Addressing the concerns from Silicon Valley over regulations, Musk maintained that having a referee was good, just like in sports. He also said that even without regulations of enforcement capabilities, governments simply highlighting concerns can be powerful.

On the impact of AI on jobs
Musk called AI the most disruptive force in history. According to him, for the first time, something will be smarter than the smartest human. He went on to say that, at some point, AI will do everything. “I don’t know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable. It’s like a magic genie – be careful what you wish for,” he said. Musk went on to say that finding meaning in life will be challenging. He cited the Olympics, saying how humans compete with each other to be the best human, and there is meaning in that. 
AI as tutors and companions 
The Tesla CEO also said that AI tutors could be ‘amazing’. He said AI can be the most patient tutor on any subject. He said that they can be great for companionship, essentially an AI friend with memory of all your interactions, reading everything about you, talking to you every day, etc. The 52-year-old said that for those with learning disabilities or having trouble making friends, an AI friend could be a great asset. He went on to recommend the sci-fi novels in the Culture Series by Scottish author Ian M Banks.
AI as an enabler
When asked about what he thought about risk appetite among companies and his notions on failure, Musk spoke about perseverance. He said that if your first start-up fails, that should not be the end of your career, instead, try again. While saying that stock options are difficult in Europe, Musk said that start-ups are high-risk and high-reward. 
ADVERTISEMENT
He also said that social media platforms are facing challenges from AI bots that are capable of passing captcha tests and manipulating information. According to him, a minor cost to use platforms could be of great help in combating bots, essentially making it expensive to create fake accounts.

On gaining public trust 
With reference to upcoming elections around the world, Sunak asked about the critical nature of managing information integrity. The X chief said that authentication of real vs AI-created media could be beneficial to gaining public trust and addressing the problem of misinformation. He cited that entertainment content, like the Pope in a Balenciaga puffer jacket, is still believed to be true by many. 
Regardless of the challenges, Musk said that this was the most interesting time. He said that, with AI, there was an 80 per cent likelihood of being net positive, and if we are cognizant about the 20 per cent downside risk, then, AI could be a great equaliser.

How to combat misinformation and disinformation during elections,We take a look at how misinformation and fake news spread during the run-up to an election and how it can undermine the electoral process,"Over 161 million people in five states — Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram — will vote in assembly elections this month. Ahead of any election, the spread of misinformation and fake news is a challenge that needs to be tackled on priority.
Take for example a recent video of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan where he can be heard saying that people are upset with the BJP and that their party will face defeat this time.

On checking it was found that the video was edited, and is from a review meeting related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bhopal in June. The original video has been overlaid with a fake audio.
In another social media post, Raman Singh, the former chief minister of Chhattisgarh, was seen applying tilak to a photo frame with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) logo on it. The picture was photoshopped. The real image, shared by the former CM, shows him applying tilak to a picture of God Narayan.

The above examples show how misinformation and fake news spread during the run-up to an election and how it can undermine the electoral process. A study, Industrialized disinformation 2020 global inventory of organised social media manipulation, conducted by University of Oxford in 81 countries, including India, says that 90 per cent countries have misinformation campaigns that involve pro-government and pro-party propaganda, 94 per cent of countries have misinformation campaigns that attack the opposition and mount smear campaigns, 73 per cent have misinformation campaigns that suppress participation through trolling or harassment and 49 per cent have misinformation campaigns that drive division and polarise citizens.

In 2022, social media platform X, formerly Twitter, reported that it had taken down over 11 million tweets for violating its policies on misinformation. In its 2022 Community Standards Enforcement Report, Facebook stated that it removed over 23 million pieces of content for violating its policies on misinformation.
While there are many ways to verify information, in today’s column, we will explain how the ‘Google Fact Check Explorer’ works.

iPhone 15 saves the day for Apple as other segments slump in September quarter,"Apple’s Q4 earnings were a mixed bag: iPhone 15 was a hit, but Mac, iPad and wearables all showed a slump. What do you think of Apple’s performance?","Apple smashed its September quarter earnings record on Thursday, thanks to the stellar performance of its iPhone 15 series, which outperformed its predecessor by a notable margin. However, the company’s phone division was the only bright spot in an otherwise gloomy report, as all other segments saw declines in revenue and sales for the fourth quarter in a row, CNBC reported.
The Mac segment suffered the most, plunging 34% year over year. Apple blamed this on the unfavourable comparison to the previous year when sales were inflated by shifting from one period to another in 2022 due to supply issues.
“I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter,” Cook told CNBC. “We’ve got the M3, we’ve got the new products, and we don’t have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis.”

The iPad and wearables segments also experienced drops of 10% and 3%, respectively. The only thing that cushioned the blow was the 16% increase in the services segment, which continued to be a consistent cash cow for the company. Cook said that every major service reached a new high, which was not surprising given the long-term growth of the services division.
Cook also expressed optimism in a press release about the upcoming holiday season, claiming that Apple had the “strongest lineup of products ever” to offer.

Retired telescope found 7 superhot exoplanets orbiting the same star,Data from NASA's retired Kepler space telescope helped scientists discover seven scorching hot planets orbiting the same star.,"NASA’s Kepler space telescope retired from duty in 2018, but the data it collected continues to yield scientific treasures. A team of researchers continuously studying data from the Kepler discovered seven searing hot planets orbiting one star. Each of them gets more radiant heat from their star per area than any planet in our solar system.
All the planets in the Kepler-385 system are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. It is one of the few systems known to host more than six verified planets or even planet candidates. At its centre, there is a star a lot like the Sun, except it is 10 per cent larger and 5 per cent hotter. The two inner planets are both slightly larger than Earth, but scientists believe they could be rocky and might even have a thin atmosphere.

"Optoma L1+ review: Projectors can now replace TVs, but you need some wall space",The Optoma L1+ is an ultra-short throw home projector that aspires to replace your television. Is it the right device for your living room?,"During the pandemic, projector reviews were something I really looked forward to. With no chance of watching movies in the theatre, this was the closest a movie buff like me could get to the big screen experience. But this was also the time I realised that even as projectors were now much better than what they used to be, many walls still come in the way of you experiencing these gadgets to their best. Let me explain with this Optoma L1+ projector review.
The Optoma L1+ is an ultra-short throw home projector that aspires to replace your television. It is light and compact and does not take much more space than what a small living room TV unit will have. All you need to set it up is to plug it into a power source and then a content source. The L1+ has an Android dongle of its own, which gives you access to content, but then, the review unit did not come with it. Users, too, have to buy this separately, which might not be needed as most of us now have at least an Amazon Fire TV dongle at home.
Earlier, I tried out Optoma and other projectors that come with the software preinstalled, and I think this is the way to go, especially if projectors have plans to replace the television. I used the projector with my Apple TV 4K. After all, this is a 4K projector.
ADVERTISEMENT
Yes, I have a living room wall where a short-throw projector can be used effectively, even though it is a bright yellow. However, my 65-inch television squats over this space. So, I had to find a location where this could be made to work. Now, with a regular projector, I would have used a wall in the bedroom or the space behind my living room sofa to project, even though watching in such situations can be uncomfortable.
But this is a short-throw projector and can’t be perched up on a stand meters away from the wall. This needs to be next to the action. My final solution was to use this on the dining table, but this meant I did not have more than 60 inches of space to project, and there was a small switchboard encroaching into the projection area.

But then, such is life. Those investing in a good projector will ideally do so because they have the mind space and space at home to move towards a home projection system.
Set up is easy, as it is with projectors these days. If the image is not how you want it, you can quickly hit the focus settings and get it perfect. The remote is very handy for everything you want to do here, as there are no buttons on the device as such. There are three HDMI ports for connectivity, and an audio out port and one S/PDIF.

The Optoma L1+ has great specs on paper with DLP 8K UHD that packs 8.3 million pixels on screen and enables HDR, low lag gaming mode with 240Hz smooth motion and 3D. All of this translates to stunning viewing on the wall, even when it is daytime. Yes, this is among the best-performing projectors I have used during the day, and that means this is an actual TV replacement if you are considering it.
Thanks to the 4LED system, the clarity is pretty good, even when you are not using a projector screen and just beaming on to your wall, like mine, which is not even white. You can make out distinct colours and shades, even of grey. Watching the Great Train Robbery series, the effect was almost as good as watching in a cinema. The Optoma L1+ has two features, which I really loved as it helped improve the experience dramatically. One is the ability to increase the HDR brightness, which worked for those times when I was watching something during the day. Second, the Dynamic Black just makes the visuals much more stunning, especially when you are watching a horror flick like the Nun 2, which has a lot of dark frames and highlights. Both of these were things you could not do in projectors before.

It helps that Optoma projectors have speakers that are better than most televisions. And this is an area where projectors have improved so much over the years. I remember how, for reviews a few years back, I had to use an extra computer speaker system. Now, you even have present audio modes like in a soundbar.
There are many preset modes, and they make a difference, especially when you are in the Movie or Gaming modes. I tried playing Asphalt 8 on the Apple TV, and the images flowed smoothly without any lag at all. But I did not overdo this as I did not want to expose my 12-year-old to the temptations of a large screen for gaming.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Optoma L1+ comes with so many settings inside that you can get every aspect of the projection exactly as you want it. I liked the ability to adjust the digital zoom. Also, you can change aspect ratio to a wide angle mode, too, if you have access to such content.
As I mentioned, my only real grouse with this device is it does not have Android TV-like software pre-baked. This should be a no-brainer these days, and using a dongle for this does not really help. For better adoption of projectors, companies need to make it a TV replacement in every sense.
At Rs 2,80,000 lakh, the Optoma L1+ might be a bit pricey for many to consider as a television replacement, especially since the best TVs are still half the price. But if you are setting up a room just for your entertainment experience, then this is certainly among the best, hassle-free options out there. Also, given how versatile this is, offices and educational institutions can also consider this as something to fall back on.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/optoma-l1-projector-review-9012835/,technology
Elon Musk’s xAI to unveil its first product tomorrow,"Elon Musk’s xAI to launch its first AI product on Saturday, claims it is better than OpenAI, Google and Anthropic in some aspects.","Elon Musk has announced with a post on X (formerly Twitter) that xAI will launch its first AI product to a select group of people on Saturday, claiming that it is “the best that currently exists” in some key aspects.
Founded in March, xAI seemingly is trying to go up against established players in the field, such as OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, which have developed some of the most advanced chatbots in the world, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude.
Musk, who is known for his ambitious and sometimes controversial ideas, has been vocal about his dissatisfaction with the current state of AI, especially its lack of alignment with human values and goals. In April, he revealed his plans for a new AI tool called “TruthGPT”, which he said would avoid the pitfalls of being “politically correct” and instead focus on the objective reality.
Tomorrow, @xAI will release its first AI to a select group.
In some important respects, it is the best that currently exists.

To achieve this goal, Musk has assembled a team of top AI researchers and engineers who have previously worked at companies like DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, Twitter and Tesla. He has also acquired thousands of powerful GPU processors from Nvidia, the leading manufacturer of chips for AI applications, to build a large language model that can rival or surpass the existing ones.
According to Greg Yang, the co-founder of xAI, the company’s mission is to explore the “mathematics of deep learning”, a branch of AI that uses large neural networks to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Yang said that xAI will “develop the ‘theory of everything’ for large neural networks” and take AI “to the next level”.
Musk founded xAI in Nevada in March, according to official documents. He had previously renamed Twitter to “X Corp.” in some financial reports, but xAI’s website clarifies that it is a separate entity from X Corp., and that it will “work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/elon-musk-xai-first-product-launch-saturday-announcement-9012222/,technology

"After phones, Arm chips are taking over the PC market: Why’s it happening?","How did Arm go from powering your phone to threatening Intel's dominance? The surprising rise of Arm, explained.","The biggest setback to Intel, and the x86 architecture as a whole, was when Apple announced that it would be transitioning over to the Arm side. There’s no doubt Intel has been facing stiff competition from Arm-based chips, with the latter keeping up their upward growth trajectory in the market. But what exactly is the deal with Arm and why is it rising in popularity? Let’s explore.
What is an Arm processor?
Arm processors have actually been around for ages, going all the way back to the 80s when they were used in some of the first personal computers. But you probably won’t see a laptop or desktop advertised as having an “Arm” chip inside like you would with Intel or AMD processors. That’s because Arm is different than Intel or AMD – Arm doesn’t actually manufacture any chips themselves. Instead, they design the architecture and cores of a processor, and then partner companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm who license those designs to build their own chips.

Giant planets like Jupiter can stop life on Earth-like neighbours,A new study has shown that gas giants in distant planetary systems can destroy life in Earth. This means that Jupiter is a black sheep as far as gas giants go since it protects life on Earth.,"Gas giants like Jupiter are massive on a scale that is difficult to understand. As many as 1,300 Earths can fit inside the volume of Jupiter. A new study shows that such giant planets can act like agents of chaos in the universe, making sure that nothing can live on its Earth-like neighbours.
In our solar system, Jupiter plays an important role as a protector. Because of its enormous gravitational field, it deflects comets and asteroids that might otherwise hit our planet. This creates a more stable environment for life. However, a study published in The Astronomical Journal in October suggests that in some planetary systems, gas giants like Jupiter can kick smaller planets out of orbit and destroy their climates.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/giant-planets-jupiter-earth-neighbours-9011942/,technology
Brave’s Leo enters the AI chatbot arena with privacy as its selling point,"Brave's new Leo chatbot promises private, anonymous AI - but can it compete with ChatGPT & Bing on conversation quality?","The AI chatbot space is getting crowded, but Brave is throwing its hat in the ring with the launch of Leo, a new chatbot built directly into the privacy-focused Brave browser. With Leo, Brave is aiming to differentiate itself by baking in privacy protections other chatbots lack.
Brave has announced it is rolling out Leo for all desktop users running version 1.60 of the browser. The chatbot was initially launched for testing in the Nightly channel back in August, with plans to expand to all users in the coming months.

Sceptical about that free VPN app? Google Play Store will now tell you if it’s secure,Google has added a new security banner to the Google Play Store that shows you which apps have been verified by a third party security assessment.,"Starting today, Google is rolling out a new security banner for certain types of apps in the Google Play Store. The banner will show you which apps have been verified by the Mobile App Security Assessment (MASA), a standard that Google introduced last year to evaluate the security and privacy practices of mobile apps. The banner will first appear for VPN apps, which handle a lot of sensitive and personal data from users.
The banner will explain that the app has been validated for the minimum global security standard, and it will display a badge that indicates the app’s MASA status. You can also find the badge in the data safety section of the app, where you can learn more about how the app protects your data.
(Image: Google)
The MASA is conducted by a third party that follows a comprehensive checklist of security and privacy criteria. The assessment covers topics such as encryption, authentication, data storage, network communication, and user consent. Apps that pass the MASA are following at least the minimum industry mobile security and privacy standards.
ADVERTISEMENT
If you want to see which apps have been reviewed by the MASA, or if you want to learn more about the assessment process, you can tap on the “Learn More” button in the banner or in the data safety section. This will take you to the App Validation Directory, where you can find a complete list of verified apps and additional technical details about the assessment.
Google says it will expand the security banner to other app categories in the future, as part of its ongoing efforts to make Android apps safer and more transparent for users.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-play-store-security-banner-vpn-apps-9011627/,technology
"Asteroid Dinkinesh is actually two space rocks, finds NASA’s Lucy mission",NASA's Lucy mission has discovered that the asteroid Dinkinesh is actually a binary system of two asteroids.,"NASA’s Lucy spacecraft was all set to fly by what was its first asteroid on Wednesday. But as it turns out, the mission flew past its first two asteroids as the spacecraft found that the main belt asteroid Dinkinesh is actually two asteroids bound together as a binary pair.
NASA launched the Lucy mission on October 16, 2021, and on its six-billion-kilometre journey, the spacecraft’s main aim is to observe the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. The Trojans are a group of small bodies that orbit the Sun in two “swarms” along the orbit of Jupiter. One swarm leads Jupiter in its orbit while another trails behind the gas giant.
Dinkinesh means “marvellous” in the Amharic language. Hal Levison, principal investigator for the Lucy mission, asserts that the asteroid has lived up to its name. “When Lucy was originally selected for flight, we planned to fly by seven asteroids. With the addition of Dinkinesh, two Trojan moons, and now this satellite, we’ve turned it up to 11,” said Levison in a NASA press statement Thursday announcing the discovery.

But the discovery of the binary pair is not a complete surprise. Lucy’s instruments were observing the asteroid’s brightness changing over time. This led Lucy’s team members to wonder if Dinkinesh might be a binary system in the weeks leading to the encounter. Now, based on preliminary analysis of the first available images, they estimate that the larger body is about 790 metres at its widest while the smaller one is about 220 metres in size.
Even though it led to the interesting discovery, Lucy’s encounter with Dinkinesh was mainly intended as an in-flight test of the spacecraft. In particular, a test of the systems that allow Lucy to autonomously track an asteroid as it flies past at thousands of kilometres per hour.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-lucy-mission-asteroid-dinkinesh-9011723/,technology
YouTube announces limits on video recommendations for teens to protect mental health,"As the role of big tech companies in the youth mental health crisis comes to the forefront of public discussion, YouTube is introoducing new safeguards to protect teen mental health.","YouTube will put restrictions on how often teenagers receive repeated video recommendations related to sensitive topics like body image.
The Google-owned video streaming platform announced Thursday that it has developed additional safeguards for content recommendations for teens that will focus on content that compares physical features and idealises some types over others, idealises specific fitness levels or body weights or displays social aggression in the form of non-contact fights and intimidation.
According to the company’s Youth and Families Advisory Committee — a team of independent experts in child development, digital learning, children’s media and more from academic, nonprofit and clinical backgrounds — such content can be innocuous as a single video, but it could be problematic if teens viewed them in repetition.

“A higher frequency of content that idealises unhealthy standards or behaviours can emphasise potentially problematic messages—and those messages can impact how some teens see themselves. Guardrails can help teens maintain healthy patterns as they naturally compare themselves to others and size up how they want to show up in the world,” said Allison Briscoe-Smith, a clinician, researcher and member of the Committee, in a press statement.
YouTube has already begun limiting repeated recommendations related to those topics for teenagers in the United States. This will be rolled out to more countries over the next year, the company said in a statement.
YouTube’s new safeguards come at a time when social media companies’ actions are under the scanner for the effect they have on children’s mental health.
In October, dozens of states in the US sued Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, accusing it of contributing to the youth mental health crisis through the addictive nature of the social media platform.

The attorneys general of 33 states in the United States, including California and New York, alleged that Meta repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platform and knowingly induced young children and teenagers into addictive social media use.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/youtube-video-recommendations-teen-mental-health-9011571/,technology
"Amazon made $1 billion with algorithms used to raise prices, says FTC","Amazon made over $1 billion using an algorithm that strategically raised the prices of the products on the platform, alleges the FTC.","The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has claimed that online commerce giant Amazon intentionally raised prices by more than $1 billion using secret algorithms.
Details from FTC’s lawsuit against Amazon filed in September were made public on Thursday as a new version of the lawsuit was made available in a Seattle court with fewer redactions. The FTC claimed that Amazon created a “secret algorithm internally codenamed ‘Project Nessie’ to identify specific products for which it predicts other online stores will follow Amazon’s price increases,” according to Reuters.
The FTC also alleged that executives at the company intentionally deleted messages on the messaging app Signal. They used a feature that makes messages disappear in an act that “destroyed more than two years” worth of communications from June 2019 to “at least early 2022” despite the trade commission asking Amazon not to do so, reports ABC News.

The FTC and 17 states had filed the lawsuit against Amazon in September, alleging the company was using its dominant position in the market to inflate prices on and off its platform while overcharging sellers and stifling competition. With this, the e-commerce giant is accused of violating federal and state antitrust laws.
In a response published in September, Amazon had said that the lawsuit would lead to higher prices and slower deliveries for consumers—and hurt businesses. “If successful, (the lawsuit would) force Amazon to engage in practices that actually harm consumers and the many businesses that sell in our store—such as having to feature higher prices, offer slower or less reliable Prime shipping, and make Prime more expensive and less convenient,” David Zapolsky, Senior Vice President, Global Public Policy & General Counsel at Amazon, said in a statement.
The FTC suit noted that beginning in the early 2010s, Amazon began testing whether other online stores’ pricing algorithms were following the prices set by Amazon’s first-party retail arm, where the company directly controls prices, according to The Register.
The company then found that it could increase its prices while reducing the risk of shoppers finding the same items at a lower price off Amazon. This would be possible if the company focused its price increases on products sold by competitors that were matching Amazon’s prices. This marked the beginning of Project Nessie.

In a prepared statement, Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle called the FTC’s claim “baseless and irresponsible,” reports the AP. “Amazon voluntarily disclosed employee Signal use to the FTC, painstakingly collected Signal conversations from its employees’ phones, and allowed agency staff to inspect those conversations even when they had nothing to do with the FTC’s investigation,” said Doyle.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/amazon-project-nessie-algorithm-ftc-lawsuit-9011492/,technology

"From Nokia 5710 to JioPhone Prima 4G, 8 feature phones packed with smartphone-like features","Looking for a feature phone that can do more than just calls and texts? Check out these amazing devices that offer UPI payments, WhatsApp support, and even health monitoring.","It’s a myth that all the latest innovations are happening on the smartphone side. In fact, lately, the feature phone segment is becoming more interesting. More and more low-cost feature phones are incorporating smartphone-like features such as UPI payments, support for WhatsApp-like apps, and more. Here is a list of power-packed feature phones that you can own without breaking the bank.
JioPhone Prima 4G
The JioPhone Prima 4G is not your average feature phone. It runs on KaiOS, an open-source project based on Firefox OS, which enables it to run over 1,200 apps that you would normally need a smartphone for, including YouTube, Google Apps, and Facebook. You can also enjoy pre-installed apps like YouTube, JioTV, Jio Cinema, JioSaavn, and JioNews.
The JioPhone Prima 4G also supports the JioPay app for UPI payments, so you can send and receive money with ease. The phone has a 2.4-inch display, a 2,000mAh battery, and an ARM Cortex A53 processor. The best part is the price: only Rs 2,599, available via Amazon, JioMart, and official Jio stores.

Lava Pulse 1
The Google Pixel 8 Pro may come with a thermometer but the Lava Pulse 1 goes a step further by packing a heart rate and blood pressure monitoring sensor into the select button. Now heart rate measurement is easy to get right – remember those pulse rate apps that used the camera flash to detect heartbeats? But the Lava Pulse 1 goes a step further by offering blood pressure monitoring as well. It does sound impressive but is also dubious, since Lava has not revealed how it works or how accurate it is.
The Lava Pulse 1 is not just a health gadget, though. It also has a 2.4-inch TFT display with a keypad, dual sim support, and a decent 1,800mAh battery. The price is not bad either, starting at Rs 1,990, but you can probably find it cheaper on other platforms.
Nokia 2660 Flip
You might have seen those fancy foldable and flippable smartphones that are all the rage these days, but do you know what inspired them? That’s right, those cool flip phones that were popular about two decades ago. The Nokia 2660 Flip is a tribute to those classic phones, with a modern twist.
It has two displays: a 2.8-inch QVGA unit on the inside and a 1.77-inch QQVGA on the outside. The outer display lets you see some useful information like the caller ID, while you can flip the phone shut to end calls with style. The phone also comes with UPI 123PAY support, which means you don’t need an internet connection to send or receive money.

JioPhone 2
The JioPhone 2 is another feature phone that runs on KaiOS, just like the Jio Prima 4G. This means that it comes with a bunch of preloaded apps such as MyJio, JioSaavn, JioTV, JioCinema, JioXpressNews, JioVideoCall, JioPay, and JioGames. You can also access other popular apps like WhatsApp through the JioStore.
But what sets this phone apart from others is the full-fledged QWERTY keyboard allowing you to have a proper smartphone-style typing experience where you don’t need to press the same button thrice to input one letter. The JioPhone 2 also boasts a large 2.40-inch horizontal display making it ideal for watching videos on the go.
Nokia 130 Music 2023
Feature phones aren’t exactly known for their audio quality but Nokia promises audio that can fill the “whole room, loud and clear, from dawn ‘til dusk” with the massive speaker unit on the back. The phone also has a sleek design that fans of minimalism would appreciate. Apart from that, the phone has a 2.4-inch display and a large 1,450mAh battery that Nokia claims can last for 30 days on standby.
Itel Muzik 430
What if you wanted a feature phone with a smartphone-sized battery? That’s what the Itel Muzik 430 offers with its massive 3,000mAh battery – a capacity that dwarfs most of its competitors in the segment. This phone delivers up to 70 days of standby time, according to Itel. Aside from this, the phone is similar to the Nokia 130 Music in that it’s a music-oriented phone and features a massive “Super 3D Stereo Speaker.”

Nokia 5710 XpressAudio
A feature phone and a pair of TWS earbuds are not your usual combo but Nokia with the 5710 XpressAudio wants to make that a thing. This handset may look like the average classic Nokia phone at first, but flip it around and you’ll see a slide-out panel that houses a pair of true wireless earbuds. The compact size of the phone means this the whole package is essentially a TWS case with a display. Read our full review of the device to decide if it’s worth getting.
Nokia 105 Classic (2023)
UPI support in a sub-Rs 1K handset is a rare feat but Nokia has achieved just that with the 105 Classis (2023).

Remains of early planet that created the Moon stuck deep within Earth: Study,"A new study suggests that massive anomalous blobs near our planet's crust are the remnants of a protoplanet that crashed into the Earth, forming the Moon.","How the Moon was created is a matter of much debate. One of the most prominent theories suggests that a planet the size of Mars collided with the Earth when it was much younger—leading to a lot of debris being created, which eventually led to the creation of the Moon. Now, a new study suggests that pieces of this planet that collided with Earth could be stuck deep within our planet.
Geophysicists in the 1980s made an interesting discovery. It seemed like there were two continent-sized blobs of unusual material deep near the centre of the planet. One under the African continent and one beneath the Pacific Ocean. Each of these “blobs” is twice the size of the Moon and is made of different proportions of elements than the mantle that surrounds them.

According to an Apple support document, the Voice Plan will be discontinued in November and existing subscribers will be able to use it until the end of their final billing cycle. Apple said that it is focusing on delivering the best music experience for its customers, with features like spatial audio, real-time lyrics, and intuitive discovery features.
Apple also said that other Apple Music plans already work seamlessly with Siri and that it will continue to optimise this experience. Existing subscribers will receive a notification with more information before their plan expires.

The Voice Plan was introduced as part of iOS 15.2 in December 2021 and was available in the US, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, and the UK. The plan gave access to the entire Apple Music catalogue of over 100 million songs, but did not include some features like downloading, spatial audio, and Family Sharing.
The Voice Plan was one of the cheapest options to access Apple Music and was seen as a way to compete with other voice-based services like Amazon Music and Spotify.

"Gaganyaan mission: After success of crew module abort test, ISRO eyes uprighting system in 2024","A crew module uprighting system will keep the crew module upright after splashdown in the sea. It is among the many elements that will be tested in the second test mission, TV-D2.","The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will be experimenting with a crew module uprighting system that will ensure that a crew module making a splashdown in the sea after a space mission stays upright and does not get inverted in the water.
A basic crew module used in the TV-D1 mission on October 21 this year did not contain such a system, resulting in the module floating in an upside-down position when recovered by naval divers in the Bay of Bengal. The TV-D1 mission was part of preparations for ISRO’s first human spaceflight Gaganyaan mission scheduled around 2024-25.
A crew module uprighting system will be among multiple systems that will be tested in a second test mission (TV-D2) for the crew module on the new test vehicle scheduled for next year before a full-fledged unmanned test flight into space for the crew module on the LVM3 rocket that is going to be part of the Gaganyaan mission, according to the TV-D1 mission director S Sivakumar.

The first test of the crew module and crew escape system in the TV D1 mission, where an abort sequence in the launch phase of a human mission was simulated, has been deemed a complete success after receiving all the data from the systems tested in the mission, Sivakumar said.
“All three elements of the mission are new. The test vehicle is new, the crew escape system is new and the crew module is new. Developing each of the systems was one of the challenges. The mission planning and mission design is very, very important here,” the scientist said. “We have got data from all the three systems and everything is nominal,” he added.
One of the biggest outcomes in the TV-D1 mission was the success of the tricky component of the deployment at a desired angle of the drogue chutes (which bring the crew module from a height of 17 km at a speed of 150 metres per second to a height of 2.5 km from the surface of the sea at a speed of 63 m/sec) after the release of crew module from the crew escape system in this mission, the 58-year-old mission director said. “The drogue chute deployment at the desired angle was a really tricky problem,” he added.

“Our mission profile was that we took the crew escape system to a particular Mach number (1.2 times the speed of sound) using the newly developed test vehicle and from there the crew escape system took the crew module it to a particular altitude and flight path angle. When the crew module comes out, we have to monitor its orientation and at the appropriate angle we have to deploy the apex cover and drogue parachutes. This was the mission design challenge,” Sivakumar said.

The mission was about understanding how to put the crew module in the appropriate position and orientation since the crew module in the TV-D1 flight did not have its own control system unlike the final crew module which will have its own onboard control system, he said.
“At 17 km altitude – when the crew module is coming out – in a real crew module, we would have a control system that is controlling the attitude such that the parachute deployment angle is controlled. Here, it is coming out in unfavorable orientation and must be deployed before the crew module starts tumbling or getting locked in an unfavorable orientation. So, we have to monitor the exact orientation and angle because only at a favourable angle can we deploy the drogue parachute. This is the real crux of the problem. The second crucial part is that we have never tested the parachute behaviour at such a high altitude,” Sivakumar pointed out.
“We don’t have the data either of our own or from literature. The drogue chutes which is the first set of parachutes deployed to reduce the descending velocity of the crew module…have been tested so far only up to an altitude of 15 km,” he said.
“At a higher altitude, the air density is very low and we had to see if the chutes would really deploy or collapse. We were trying to look at this aspect because we do not have this data,” he added.

Since an aircraft or a chopper cannot be taken to a height of 17 km altitude in the sky to conduct the parachute deployment experiment and massive balloons would be needed to test the deployment for a system weighing 4.5 tonnes, the newly designed Test Vehicle was used. “A new rocket was made,” Sivakumar said.
“We have tried to generate some fundamental data. All the parachutes and crew escape system are newly designed for the Gaganyaan programme,” said Sivakumar, who has a Master’s degree from IIT Mumbai and has been with ISRO for 38 years after joining initially with a diploma in engineering.
While the TV-D1 mission used a basic capsule that is similar in weight and mass properties to the final crew module for the Gaganyaan mission, a second demonstration flight next year will involve a crew module closer to the final one.
“We will be simulating the crew seats, control and floatation syxtem etc close to the final version. In the present experiment, these things were not simulated. In this mission, only an equivalent mass and inertia is used. These will all be part of the test vehicle D2 flight next year,” Sivakumar said.
The crew module uprighting system

One of the elements that will be tested in the crew module for the D2 mission is a crew module uprighting system that will keep the crew module upright after splashdown in the sea, unlike the TV-D1 splashdown which got inverted after landing upright.
“The two stable positions are upright and upside down. Now, to avoid the upside-down situation in the real crew module, there will be an uprighting system that will be like gaseous balloons – something like the airbags in cars that deploy on impact – which will inflate at the time of touchdown,” Sivakumar said.
  Test vehicle graphic from TV-D1.
“If the crew module is trying to topple, the balloon system will bring it back to the upright position. In this particular crew module, we have not put that and that is why it has gone down to the inverted position after splashdown. We wanted to see if it could remain stable and we found that when there is a lateral wind and disturbance due to sea waves it goes to an unstable point and that is why it was near an upside-down position,” he said.
“This was anticipated and was not a surprise as we did not include the system in this mission,” the TV-D1 mission director said. The crew module will also have redundancy systems in place to compensate for the failure of the primary crew module uprighting system, he said.

“The recovery aids like the beacons had to work well underwater and the sea water dye should get ejected to mark the region of the landing. These are the other parameters that have to be considered,” he said. However, in TV D1 the module landed upright and then it toppled presumably due to disturbance from sea conditions.
Even if the crew module was in the water in an upside-down position, the communication systems was not affected since antennas are on the sidewall and “they were radiating”, Sivakumar said.
According to a recent paper on a crew module uprighting system being developed for the Orion crew module to be used on National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Artemis 1 mission to the moon, 47 per cent of all landings during the Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz programmes were in an inverted orientation “with the nose of the crew module submerged – creating a risk to crew egress”.
“Inverted or sideways stable configurations for the CM [crew module] would result in submergence of the hatch doors and communications antennae and an undesirable crew orientation. The CMUS [crew module uprighting system] provides the CM with additional buoyancy to reorient itself into the upright configuration post-splashdown and maintain this orientation for at least 24 hours,” says the paper on ‘Dynamic Characterization of the Crew Module Uprighting System for NASA’s Orion Crew Module’ authored by NASA scientist Ivan Rodrigues Bertaska and others.

“We are targeting the next test vehicle mission sometime in the first quarter of next year. The crew module made with the control systems and simulate the crew seat systems and suspension systems, the uprighting system etc. Also in the crew escape system we will use both low and high altitude escape motors unlike in D1 where we have used only the high altitude escape motors. All these elements will be tested in the TV-D2 mission,” Sivakumar said.
The Gaganyaan project plans to demonstrate human spaceflight capability by launching a crew (of around three members) to an orbit of 400 km in space on a three-day mission. The mission aims to bring the human crew back to earth safely by landing in Indian sea waters.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/gaganyaan-mission-after-success-of-crew-module-abort-test-isro-eyes-uprighting-system-in-2024-9010271/,technology

"Next Apple Watch to detect blood pressure, sleep apnea; health coach service reportedly in works",Apple's next-generation Apple watch could get new sensors to detect elevated blood pressure and sleep apnea.,"Apple plans to update the Apple Watch in a significant way by adding new sensors that can detect blood pressure and sleep apnea, according to a report from Bloomberg on Wednesday.
The Cupertino giant is working on an “evolving approach to health care,” according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The next-generation Apple Watch, likely to be marketed as Series 9, will include a sensor to detect when your blood pressure rises. It won’t show exact systolic and diastolic measurements, but Apple does have plans to add that in future versions of the Apple Watch.
Apple has been speculated to add the ability to measure blood pressure on the Apple Watch for years. Smartwatches from rivals, including Samsung, already offer blood pressure measurement in some markets, but not in the US, where FDA clearance takes years. Currently, Omron offers an FDA-cleared blood pressure watch on the market. However, even if Apple brings a blood pressure Apple Watch to the market, it likely won’t be a replacement for regular monitoring by a medical professional.
ADVERTISEMENT
Next year’s Apple Watch will also reportedly monitor breathing and sleeping habits to predict if a person has sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops and starts during the night. However, the new sensor to detect sleep apnea will be limited. The watch will reportedly recommend visiting a doctor if it detects sleep apnea.
Both new features will reportedly be tied to a new paid health service, which could be announced as early as next year. The paid health coaching service could boost Apple’s Services offerings and eventually help increase revenue. Apple’s services business is its second largest, just behind the iPhone, generating $19.6 billion in revenue during the third quarter, up 12 per cent year over year. The report also says Apple continues to focus on health features, and in the future, it may integrate Fitness Plus, its video workouts service, into the Vision Pro headset.
In another article, Gurman writes that Apple’s deeper penetration in healthcare has slowed down a bit, in part due to concerns from senior executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and COO Jeff Williams. The executives reportedly don’t want to go wrong in the high-stakes field of healthcare, as it “could tarnish the perception of the company.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/next-apple-watch-to-detect-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea-health-coach-service-reportedly-in-works-9010119/,technology

"China, US and EU agree to work together on AI safety at UK summit","The declaration set out a two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building scientific understanding of them, while also developing cross-country policies to mitigate them.","China agreed to work with the United States, European Union and other countries to collectively manage the risk from artificial intelligence at a British summit on Wednesday aimed at charting a safe way forward for the rapidly evolving technology.
Some tech executives and political leaders have warned the rapid development of AI poses an existential threat to the world if not controlled, sparking a race by governments and international institutions to design safeguards and regulations.
In a first for Western efforts to manage its safe development, a Chinese vice minister joined U.S. and EU leaders and tech bosses such as Elon Musk and ChatGPT’s Sam Altman at Bletchley Park, home of Britain’s World War Two code-breakers.
ADVERTISEMENT
More than 25 countries present, including the United States and China, as well as the EU, signed a “Bletchley Declaration” saying countries needed to work together and establish a common approach on oversight.

The declaration set out a two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building scientific understanding of them, while also developing cross-country policies to mitigate them.
Wu Zhaohui, China’s vice minister of science and technology, told the opening session of the two-day summit that Beijing was ready to increase collaboration on AI safety to help build an international “governance framework”.
“Countries regardless of their size and scale have equal rights to develop and use AI,” he said.

Fears about the impact AI could have on economies and society took off in November last year when Microsoft-backed OpenAI made ChatGPT available to the public.
Using natural language processing tools to create human-like dialogue, it has stoked fears, including among some AI pioneers, that machines could in time achieve greater intelligence than humans, leading to unlimited, unintended consequences.
Governments and officials are now trying to chart a way forward alongside AI companies which fear being weighed down by regulation before the technology reaches its full potential.
“I don’t know what necessarily the fair rules are, but you’ve got to start with insight before you do oversight,” the billionaire Musk told reporters, adding that a “third-party referee” could be used to sound the alarm when risks develop.
ADVERTISEMENT
While the European Union has focused its AI oversight on data privacy and surveillance and their potential impact on human rights, the British summit is looking at so-called existential risks from highly capable general-purpose models called “frontier AI”.
Mustafa Suleyman, the cofounder of Google Deepmind, told reporters he did not think current AI frontier models posed any “significant catastrophic harms” but said it made sense to plan ahead as the industry trains ever larger models.

CODE-BREAKER VENUE
The summit is the brainchild of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who wants to carve out a post-Brexit role for his country as an intermediary between the economic blocs of the United States, China and the EU.
British digital minister Michelle Donelan said it was an achievement just to get so many key players in one room. She announced two further AI Safety Summits, one to be held in South Korea in six months and another in France six months after that.
ADVERTISEMENT
“For the first time, we now have countries agreeing that we need to look not just independently but collectively at the risk around frontier AI,” Donelan told reporters.
Just as tech companies compete for dominance in AI, governments are jostling to lead the way on regulation.
China is a key participant at the summit, given the country’s role in developing AI. But some British lawmakers have questioned whether it should be there given the low level of trust between Beijing, Washington and many European capitals when it comes to Chinese involvement in technology.
The United States made clear on the eve of the summit that the call to Beijing had very much come from Britain, with its Ambassador to London, Jane Hartley, telling Reuters: “This is the UK invitation, this is not the U.S.” U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’s decision to give a speech in London on Wednesday about her government’s response to AI and hold some meetings with attendees away from the summit, meaning they may have to leave early, also raised some eyebrows.

Sachin Dev Duggal, founder of London-based AI firm Builder.ai said it risked undermining the event’s core focus, while some lawmakers from Sunak’s Conservative Party suggested Washington was trying to overshadow his summit.
British officials denied that, saying they wanted as many voices as possible.

Apple M3 Silicon: Everything you need to know,These M3 processors power the latest MacBook Pro lineup.,"Earlier this week, Apple unveiled the M3 series, which includes the new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. These new chips, designed for Mac, offer significant performance improvements while maintaining long battery life and efficiency. In fact, for the first time, it seems that Apple is committed to bringing AAA gaming to the Mac. Here are the details.
Built on 3nm process
Apple is the only company currently shipping products featuring 3nm (TSMC N3B) chips, and this is a significant development in terms of power efficiency. A 3nm chip (not the actual transistor size) consumes less power compared to a processor fabricated using a 4/5nm process. Another advantage of the M3 is that it’s a monolithic chip, where a single slab of silicon has all the components like CPU, GPU, and NPU etched into it, reducing latency and power consumption.

"FAA completes safety review of SpaceX Starship, most powerful rocket ever","Elon Musk's SpaceX has cleared one more hurdle ahead of the second launch of its Starship, the most powerful rocket built in history.","Elon Musk’s SpaceX has gotten one step closer to the highly anticipated second test flight of its massive Starship launch vehicle. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday said that it has concluded the safety review of Starship after it exploded during its debut launch in April.
The FAA had ordered SpaceX to ground Starship, which is the most powerful rocket ever built, until it takes many corrective actions. This was because the launch vehicle’s debut launch in April ended in an explosion.

Want to fast-charge your iPhone? Here’s a look at the best adapters,Buying fast charger for your brand new iPhone made easy.,"Apple is slowly but steadily introducing fast charging capabilities on iPhones. However, iPhones still do not charge as quickly as most Android phones, which offer up to a whopping 150W and can fully charge the battery in just a matter of minutes.
Most Android phones ship with a fast charging adapter within the box, while iPhones just come with a USB cable, which makes it even more confusing for the user to find the right power adapter that offers the best charging experience.

This app makes Android phones unusable by sending fake Bluetooth requests,"Bluetooth-LE-Spam is an Android app that can spam Android devices with fake Bluetooth connection requests, rendering them almost unusable.","Inspired by Flipper Zero, a tiny piece of hardware that can be used by hackers to bombard iPhone and Android users with non-stop Bluetooth pop-ups, a software developer has created a new Android app called ‘Bluetooth-LE-Spam’.
The app works by broadcasting fake Bluetooth Low Energy connections impersonating various devices, which are received by Android phones to pair devices like wireless earbuds, smart keys and RFID tags.
According to Bleeping Computer, the project is still in the early stages, but the app works as intended. Once installed, it impersonates ‘Fast Pair’ on Android and can send fake Bluetooth requests to other devices in intervals as less as 1 second.

For the uninitiated, Fast Pair is a technology that allows your earbuds to connect to your phone as soon as you take them out of the case without having to manually pair them from Bluetooth settings.
Here’s what the app looks like. (Image Source: Bleeping Computer)

While the app offers the option to adjust the transmission power, the publication found that fake Bluetooth broadcasts were detected by the target only if the victim’s phone was physically close to the device running the Bluetooth-LE-Spam app, but sometimes it was able to send notifications from a few meters away. However, this was not the case with Flipper Zero, as it is a dedicated piece of hardware with more range.
Another thing to note here is that the app caused Bluetooth peripherals like mouse and keyboard to become unresponsive when it was spamming fake requests. Currently, the Bluetooth-LE-Spam app might not be a threat to users, but it might be able to cause chaos in the future.
If you think you are being targeted by fake Bluetooth connection requests generated by Bluetooth-LE-Spam, open the ‘Settings’ app on your phone, navigate to ‘Google’ and tap on ‘Nearby Share’. Turn the feature off and you will be good to go.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/this-app-makes-android-phones-unusable-by-sending-fake-bluetooth-requests-9008853/,technology
Exquisite new details of Crab Nebula captured by Webb Telescope,The James Webb Space Telescope has captured never-before-seen details of the Crab Nebula.,"The explosion of a star, a supernova recorded in the year 1,054 AD by 11th-century astronauts, led to the creation of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant. Now, the James Webb Space Telescope has looked at the nebula that is located 65,000 light-years away in the constellation Taurus, revealing exquisite new details that have never been seen before.
A team of researchers is looking for answers about the Crab Nebula’s origins, and they turned to Webb’s NIRCam and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) imagers.
In the new image, the general shape of the supernova remnant is similar to an earlier optical wavelength image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. In the infrared image taken by Webb, the structure of fluffy gaseous filaments is shown in red-orange. In the central regions of the image, you can see some emissions from dust grains in yellow-white and green. This is the first time this feature has been mapped out by any telescope.

Apart from that, some additional aspects that throw light on the inner workings of the Crab Nebula are more prominent and can be seen in greater detail in the infrared light captured by Webb.
Webb is particularly good at highlighting “synchrotron radiation,” which is the emission produced by charged particles like electrons moving around magnetic field lines at near relativistic speeds. That radiation appears in the image in the form of smoke-like material throughout the Crab Nebula’s interior. That is a product of the nebula’s pulsar, which is a rapidly rotating neutron star. The strong magnetic fields of the pulsar accelerate particles to extremely high speeds and make them emit radiation as they wind around the field lines.
If you trace the wispy material that creates a circular ripple-like pattern in the middle, you can locate the Crab Nebula’s pulsar heart. Follow the thin white ribbons of radiation farther out from the core. There, the curvy wisps are grouped together closely, outlining the structure of the pulsar’s magnetic field.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/crab-nebula-webb-telescope-9008944/,technology

PS5 Slim leaked images reveal new console shaves off several inches,A user posted a series of images of the upcoming gaming console showing it off from several angles before taking them down.,"Sony is gearing up to launch a new version of its PlayStation 5 console, which will have a slimmer design than the original one. The new PS5, which is expected to hit the market in November, has been spotted in some leaked images that show how it compares to its predecessor.
The images, which were posted by user @phantonpainss on X (formerly Twitter), show the new PS5 next to the original one, highlighting the differences in their sizes. The new PS5 has a smaller overall footprint and has shaved off several centimetres from both its length and width.
However, the slimmer design does not seem to affect the functionality of the device, as the back of the console still has the same ports as the original one. These include an HDMI port, two USB ports, a power connector, and an ethernet port.

While the post has since been taken down possibly due to a copyright strike by Sony, The Verge managed to save a couple of those just in the nick of time.
The images also confirm a previous rumour that the PS5’s disc drive will need an internet connection during setup. One of the images shows a message on the screen that says, “Can’t use your disc drive. You need to connect your PS5 to the network to register your disc drive to your PS5.”
Sony has not yet announced an official release date for the new PS5 console, but it is likely to be sometime in November. The price of the new PS5 will be $499.99 for the disc version and $449.99 for the digital version.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/ps5-slim-leaked-images-9008839/,technology
Asteroid ‘Dinkinesh’ to get a visitor today: NASA’s Lucy spacecraft,"NASA's Lucy mission will today fly by an asteroid called 'Dinkinesh,' situated in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.","The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Lucy spacecraft is on an epic 6-billion-kilometre-long journey to study the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. The space agency says that Lucy is preparing for its first close-up look at an asteroid, which will happen on Wednesday. Up to this point, the asteroid has been an unresolved smudge even on the best telescopes.
And that asteroid will be “Dinkinesh,” which is about a kilometre wide and orbits the Sun in the main belt of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The mission has been visually tracking Dinkinesh since September 3, and it will be the first asteroid that Lucy will visit on its 12-year-long journey. It is possible for Lucy to observe so many because it won’t stop or orbit the asteroids. Instead, it will collect as much data as possible as it speeds by them in a “flyby.”

Why just break walnuts when you can hammer a nail: Xiaomi’s Longjing Dragon Crystal Glass explained,"Xiaomi is using an in-house glass to protect the OLED screen on its latest flagship smartphone, the Xiaomi 14 Pro. It is both strong and revolutionary, here’s why.","Despite the massive improvement in terms of scratch resistance and strength over the last decade, the display is still in a state where it remains the most susceptible part of a smartphone. In fact, according to a report by OnsiteGo – a smartphone after-sale service provider – 71 per cent of smartphone repairs are related to the display. Perhaps, this is why brands are directing their money and efforts into enhancing the durability of the display, essentially, the glass that protects the display.
And, when brands achieve something exceptional, they will never shy away from showing off that technology to the world, which includes the famous “crack the walnut” challenge by Honor Tech or hammering a nail into a piece of wood using the Xiaomi 14 Pro as a hammer by social media influencers.

But the summit, which focuses on highly capable general-purpose models called “frontier AI”, has managed to attract U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China’s vice tech minister and United Nations’ Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
Britain’s technology minister Michelle Donelan said “the right people with the right expertise” would be around the table to discuss how to mitigate the risks of AI.
China will be a key participant, given the country’s role in developing AI technology, although questions have been raised by some lawmakers in Britain about its presence.

The U.S. ambassador to Britain, Jane Hartley, said the AI conversation should be global, but added that the invitation to China had come from London.
“This is the UK invitation, this is not the U.S.,” she told Reuters. “When the UK government was talking to us, we said it’s your summit. So if you want to invite them, invite them”.
Canada’s minister of innovation, science and industry Francois-Philippe Champagne said AI would not be constrained by national borders, and therefore interoperability between different regulations being put in place was important.
“The risk is that we do too little, rather than too much, given the evolution and speed with which things are going,” he told Reuters.

Halloween 2023: ‘Bones’ of a ghostly cosmic hand revealed by X-ray telescopes,NASA celebrated Halloween by sharing this X-ray image of a ghostly cosmic hand thousands of light-years away from our planet.,"Halloween 2023: It is Halloween tonight, and while you might catch a glimpse of a few ghosts on your street, none of them are real. But scientists have used two X-ray telescopes to reveal the “bones” of a hand-shaped structure in space. This hand-shaped structure reveals the behaviour of an actual ghost—a dead collapsed star that lives on in the form of plumes of energised matter and antimatter.
This is how the ghost came to be. Around 1,500 years ago, a massive star in our galaxy ran out of nuclear fuel. And then, it collapsed onto itself, in the process forming an extremely dense object called a neutron star.

Apple revamps Mac lineup and pricing with new family of chips,"The new computers and the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were unveiled at an online event heavily focused on professional users.","Apple on Monday introduced new MacBook Pro and iMac computers and three new chips to power them, with the company saying it had redesigned its graphics processing units (GPU), a key part of the chip where Nvidia dominates the market.
The new computers and the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were unveiled at an online event heavily focused on professional users.
In the U.S., the 14-inch MacBook Pro laptop will start at $1,599 and a 16-inch version starts at $2,499. The new iMac desktop with the M3 family of chips starts at $1,299. Some will be available next week, while others will not ship until later in November.

Apple has seen a revitalization in its Mac business, roughly doubling its market share to nearly 11% since 2020 when it parted ways with Intel and started using its own custom-designed chips as the brains of the machines, according to preliminary data from IDC.

As part of the focus on business users on Monday, it showed off a new secure screen sharing feature that would let them on their machines from remote locations.
The company’s custom chips, which use design technology from Arm Holdings , have given its Macs better battery life and, for some tasks, better performance than machines using Microsoft’s Windows operating system.
Unlike other laptop makers that might combine a central processor unit (CPU) from Intel with a GPU from Nvidia, Apple has combined both parts in its Apple silicon chips, which the company claims gives it better performance than its rivals.
ADVERTISEMENT
Apple’s shakeup of the market has spurred Qualcomm to redouble its efforts to make Arm-based chips for Windows, announcing plans last week to release a chip that is both faster and more energy efficient than some Apple offerings. Reuters last week reported that Nvidia also plans to jump into the PC market as early as 2025.
CORPORATE BUYING
Apple aimed the new machines squarely at designers, musicians and software developers, at one point highlighting that the way it users memory can be used by artificial intelligence researchers, whose chatbots and other creations are often constrained by how much data can be held in the computer’s memory.
Apple also tweaked its overall lineup of computers in ways that could change the behavior of corporate buyers.
While slashing the U.S. price of the new 14-inch MacBook Pro from $1,999 to $1,599, Apple appeared to have eliminated a cheaper $1,299 13-inch model of its MacBook Pro that was a big seller to businesses, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies.
ADVERTISEMENT
That move will likely clarify the choice between the company’s model lines, prompting choices between Apple’s productivity-oriented MacBook Air models that top out at $1,299 or the new $1,599 starting price for MacBook Pro models.
At Apple, the Mac hit $40.18 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2022, or about 11% of its revenue. While that was up 14% from the previous fiscal year, sales this year have slowed along with the rest of the PC industry, which has suffered a post-pandemic slump.
Apple said the new chips would be the first for laptops and desktops that use 3 nanometer manufacturing technology, which will give the chips better performance for each watt of electricity used.
Apple did not name who is making the chips, but analysts believe it is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which uses the same technology to make chips for the top-end iPhone 15 models.

Google CEO acknowledges importance of being default search engine in US trial,The U.S. government brought the case over whether Google acted illegally to maintain its dominance of online search and parts of search advertising.,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Monday acknowledged the importance of making its search engine the default in keeping users loyal — a key point in a once-in-a generation U.S. antitrust fight focused on billions of dollars Google paid to be the default on laptops and smartphones.
Google, which started paying for default status on devices in 2005, monitored for compliance. At one point, the company expressed concern to Apple that its Safari browser would send particular queries, especially lucrative ones, to companies like Amazon.com.
“We were obviously doing the deal for default placement,” said Pichai.

Under cross-examination, Pichai said of Google’s tens of billions in annual payments for default status: “We definitely see value.”

The U.S. government brought the case over whether Google acted illegally to maintain its dominance of online search and parts of search advertising. If the government wins, the company may be forced to scrap some business practices that have helped it stay on top.
In testimony Monday morning, Pichai, who was called by Google, was shown instances when the company pressed Apple, wireless companies and smartphone makers to make its search engine the default on their devices in exchange for revenue-sharing agreements.
“We pay for preload exclusivity on a device-by-device basis,” Pichai said under questioning by the Justice Department.
ADVERTISEMENT
A lawyer for the Justice Department asked Pichai about a 2007 discussion among Google executives including Pichai, before he became chief executive, about an Apple request to let users choose their search engine on a new version of its Safari browser.
A document at the time said 75% of people do not change defaults and noted: “Defaults have strong impact.”
Pichai also took a couple of swipes at rival Microsoft’s browser, Internet Explorer.
“The browser market at the time had kind of stagnated,” Pichai said of the period before Google launched its Chrome browser, which competes with the Microsoft product.
ADVERTISEMENT
“They (Microsoft) were not that incented to improve the browser,” he added, calling Chrome a “pretty dramatic improvement” when it launched in 2008.
Google’s strength in search makes it a heavy hitter in the lucrative advertising market, its biggest revenue source.
Google has argued that if people are dissatisfied with default search engines, they can and do switch to another search provider. It has also argued the revenue-share agreements are legal and it has invested heavily to keep its search and advertising businesses competitive.
In cross-examination, the Justice Department pressed Pichai about allegations that Google executives marked sensitive documents as covered by attorney-client privilege when they were not and routinely deleted instant messages without determining if they should be saved as part of litigation.

Graphic pro-Israel ads make their way into children’s video games,"Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs' head of digital, David Saranga, confirmed that the video was a government-promoted ad but said he had ""no idea"" how it ended up inside various games.","Maria Julia Cassis was sitting down to a meal in her terraced home in north London when her 6-year-old son ran into the dining room, his face pale.
The puzzle game on his Android phone had been interrupted by a video showing Hamas militants, terrified Israeli families and blurred graphic footage. Over a black screen, a message from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the first grader: “WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO HARM US PAY A HEAVY PRICE.”
Cassis, a 28-year-old barista from Brazil, said that the ad left her son shaken and she quickly deleted the game.

“He was shocked,” she said in a telephone interview last week. “He literally said, ‘What is this bloody ad doing in my game?'”

Reuters has not been able to establish how the ad came to Saranga’s son’s video game, but her family isn’t alone. The news agency has documented at least five other cases across Europe where the same pro-Israel video, which carried footage of rocket attacks, a fiery explosion, and masked gunmen, was shown to gamers, including several children.
In at least one case, the ads were played inside the popular “Angry Birds” game made by SEGA-owned developer Rovio .
Rovio confirmed that “somehow these ads with disturbing content have in error made it through to our game” and were now being blocked manually. Spokesperson Lotta Backlund did not provide details on which of its “dozen or so ad partners” had supplied it with the ad.

Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ head of digital, David Saranga, confirmed that the video was a government-promoted ad but said he had “no idea” how it ended up inside various games.
He said the footage was part of a larger advocacy drive by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which has spent $1.5 million on internet ads since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on civilians in southern Israel ignited war in Gaza. He said officials had specifically instructed advertisers “to block it for people under 18”.
Saranga defended the graphic nature of the ad campaign.
“We want the world to understand that what happened here in Israel,” he said. “It’s a massacre.”
Reuters contacted 43 advertising firms that Rovio listed on its website as “third-party data partners” to try to ascertain who placed the ad in the games.

Of those partners, 12 responded, including Amazon, Index Exchange and Pinterest, and said they were not responsible for the ad appearing on Angry Birds.
Saranga said the ministry had spent money with ad companies including Taboola, Outbrain, Alphabet’s Google and X, formerly known as Twitter. Taboola and Outbrain said they had nothing to do with the gaming ads.
Google ran more than 90 ads for the foreign ministry but declined to comment on where it displayed those ads. X, formerly known as Twitter, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Reuters found no evidence of an analogous Palestinian digital advertising effort, save for a few Arabic-language videos promoted by West Bank-based Palestine TV, a news agency affiliated with the Palestinian Authority.
ADVERTISEMENT
A representative from the Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry shared a statement saying the ministry was working to sway public opinion by sharing evidence of suffering in Gaza under the Israeli bombardment that followed the Oct. 7 attack, but did not say whether it was using advertising as a tool.
Representatives from Hamas, the Islamist movement that governs Gaza, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment about its media campaigns.
Reuters documented six cases – in Britain, France, Austria, Germany and Holland – where people had seen the same or similar ads as Cassis’ son or said their children had seen them. In the Cassis family’s case, the ads appeared in a game called “Alice’s Mergeland” made by a developer called LazyDog Game. Other ads appeared on family-friendly digital pastimes such as the block-building game “Stack,” puzzle game “Balls’n Ropes,” “Solitaire: Card Game 2023,” and run-and-jump adventure “Subway Surfers.”
Alexandra Marginean, a 24-year-old intern living in Munich said she was surprised to see the pro-Israel video pop up in the middle of her game of Solitaire.

LazyDog Game did not respond to requests for comment. Stack’s Ubisoft-owned developer Ketchapp, Solitaire’s Austrian developer nerByte, Balls’n Ropes’ Turkish developer Rollic and Subway Surfers’ Danish developer SYBO Games also did not return messages seeking comment on the ads.
Apple and Alphabet’s Google, which police the apps on their in-house software platforms for iPhones and Android phones, respectively, referred questions back to the games’ developers.
Rules on advertisements vary by country, but in Britain – where Cassis and her son live – it’s the Advertising Standards Authority that monitors publicity campaigns.

14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros
The new MacBook Pro lineup features the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, delivering significant CPU and GPU performance improvements. The lineup now includes a baseline 14-inch MacBook Pro model for the first time, featuring the standard M3 chip, alongside the usual higher-end configurations with the M3 Pro and M3 Max, available in both 14-inch and 16-inch sizes. This marks the end of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The new GPU in the M3 series includes features like Dynamic Caching and ray tracing.
Apple claims that the M3 Pro is up to 20 per cent faster than the previous-generation M2 equivalent, while the M3 Max is up to 2x faster than the M2 Max. With the M3 Max, the MacBook Pro can now support up to 128 GB of RAM. Battery life is rated at up to 22 hours, and Apple states that these laptops offer consistent performance whether plugged in or running on battery power. Although the external design of the laptops remains the same, Apple did introduce a new Space Black colour option.
Pricing for the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 starts at Rs 169,990, while the model with the M3 Pro comes in at Rs 199,990. The 16-inch MacBook Pro model starts at Rs 249,900.

Microsoft reportedly starts blocking unofficial Xbox controllers & accessories,"Microsoft has apparently started blocking unlicensed controllers and accessories on Xbox. Some users say they are getting an error message saying, 'A connected accessory is not authorised'.","Microsoft has actively started blocking unlicensed controllers and accessories for some Xbox users. This means controllers that are not authorised by Microsoft will no longer work with the gaming console.
According to a report by Windows Central, many Xbox users are getting a pop-up that says ‘A connected accessory is not authorised’ along with a text that says ‘the unauthorised accessory will be blocked from use on 12/11/2023. At the bottom, it shows error message 0x82d60002.
It looks like the issue surfaced after Microsoft released OS version 10.0.25398.2266 on October 16. Earlier this year, Brook Gaming, a company known for making third party accessories like steering wheel, fighting board and controller for Xbox shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that some of their products either stopped working fully or partially after the change.

"Moon is older than we thought, suggests samples brought by Apollo 17 astronauts",New analysis of Moon samples brought by the Apollo 17 mission suggests that the Moon is older than we initially thought.,"A new analysis of samples of the Moon brought back by Apollo 17 astronauts suggest that the Moon is 40 million years older than previously thought.
The Moon was formed more than 4 billion years ago when the solar system was still young and the planet was still growing. At that time, an object nearly the size of Mars crashed into our planet and the biggest piece that broke off formed the Moon. But there is still debate about exactly when this happened.
For a new study published in the journal Geochemical Perspectives Letters, scientists used crystals brought back from the Moon by Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972 to better understand the timing of the Moon’s formation. Based on their discovery, the Moon is 40 million years older than previously thought, at least 4.46 billion years old, according to the University of Chicago.

The samples that the researchers used were brought back by astronauts during the last crewed mission to the moon. According to the researchers, these samples contain tiny crystals that formed billions of years ago, which could give signs about when the Moon was formed. When Earth was impacted by the Mars-sized object, the energy melted rock that eventually became the surface of the Moon.
“When the surface was molten like that, zircon crystals couldn’t form and survive. So any crystals on the moon’s surface must have formed after this lunar magma ocean cooled. Otherwise, they would have been melted, and their chemical signatures would be erased,” said Phillipp Heck, lead author of the study, in a press statement. Heck is a professor at the University of Chicago.
Since these crystals could have only formed after the “magma ocean” formed, their age would also tell us about the minimum possible age of the Moon. The scientists used an analytical method called atom probe tomography, which helped them arrive at the age of these crystals.
Learning more about the Moon will also help us understand a lot more about our own planet. The Moon stabilised the Earth’s axis and is part of the reason why a day goes on for 24 hours. It stabilised Earth’s rotational axis.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/moon-older-than-thought-apollo-17-samples-8997445/,technology

Partial lunar eclipse this week will be visible in India: Everything you need to know,Lunar eclipse 2023: Here is everything you need to know about the lunar eclipse happening on October 29.,"After the rare “ring of fire” solar eclipse on October 14 that was not visible in India, a partial lunar eclipse is set to happen between 1.06 AM and 2.23 AM IST on Sunday, October 29. The eclipse will be visible in India and all other locations where the Moon will be above the horizon at the time, including Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe, Antarctica and Oceania.
When viewed from New Delhi, the eclipse can be seen in the south-western sky, according to the astronomy website In the Sky. The Moon will be about 62 degrees above the horizon at the moment of greatest eclipse. The greatest eclipse will happen at 1.45 AM IST on October 29. At that time, about 12 per cent of the Moon’s disk will be in Earth’s shadow.
What happens during a lunar eclipse?
Lunar eclipses happen when the Earth is positioned exactly between the Moon and the Sun. This causes our planet’s shadow to fall on the Moon’s surface, partially dimming it in the case of a total eclipse, turning the Moon a red colour.
ADVERTISEMENT
What is the difference between a total and partial lunar eclipse?
The lunar eclipse happening on October 29 is a partial lunar eclipse, which means that the Sun, Earth and Moon are aligned imperfectly. This means only part of the Moon will pass through the Earth’s umbra (the dark part of its shadow) This shadow will grow before reaching a peak and then start shrinking.

But if it was a total lunar eclipse, the shadow would have grown until it completely enveloped the Moon. At this point, the only light reaching the Moon would be the light that travels through Earth’s atmosphere. Our planet’s atmosphere scatters the shorter wavelengths of light—the blues and the violets—in a process known as Rayleigh scattering. This means that the redder wavelengths of the Sun’s light reach the Moon and reflect of it, giving it the characteristic “Blood Moon” appearance.
How can you watch a lunar eclipse?
Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is safe to view directly without any eye protection. If you want to catch a better view, you can also use a telescope or a pair of binoculars.
When will the next lunar eclipse in India after the October 29 one?
After the October 29 eclipse, the next lunar eclipse visible in the country will happen on September 7, 2025. That is going to be a total lunar eclipse.

When was the last eclipse visible in India?
Before this, the last eclipse that was visible in the country happened on November 8, 2022.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/partial-lunar-eclipse-october-23-time-date-details-8997261/,technology

Nvidia to make Arm-based PC chips in major new challenge to Intel,"Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm's efforts could shake up a PC industry that Intel long dominated but which is under increasing pressure from Apple.","Nvidia dominates the market for artificial intelligence computing chips. Now it is coming after Intel’s longtime stronghold of personal computers.
Nvidia has quietly begun designing central processing units (CPUs) that would run Microsoft’s Windows operating system and use technology from Arm Holdings , two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The AI chip giant’s new pursuit is part of Microsoft’s effort to help chip companies build Arm-based processors for Windows PCs. Microsoft’s plans take aim at Apple, which has nearly doubled its market share in the three years since releasing its own Arm-based chips in-house for its Mac computers, according to preliminary third-quarter data from research firm IDC.

Nvidia and AMD could sell PC chips as soon as 2025, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia and AMD would join Qualcomm, which has been making Arm-based chips for laptops since 2016. At an event on Tuesday that will be attended by Microsoft executives, including vice president of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri, Qualcomm plans to reveal more details about a flagship chip that a team of ex-Apple engineers designed, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Nvidia shares closed up 3.84%, and Intel shares ended down 3.06% after the Reuters report on Nvidia’s plans. Arm’s shares were up 4.89% at close.
Nvidia spokesperson Ken Brown, AMD spokesperson Brandi Marina, Arm spokesperson Kristen Ray and Microsoft spokesperson Pete Wootton all declined to comment.

Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm’s efforts could shake up a PC industry that Intel long dominated but which is under increasing pressure from Apple. Apple’s custom chips have given Mac computers better battery life and speedy performance that rivals chips that use more energy. Executives at Microsoft have observed how efficient Apple’s Arm-based chips are, including with AI processing, and desire to attain similar performance, one of the sources said.
In 2016, Microsoft tapped Qualcomm to spearhead the effort for moving the Windows operating system to Arm’s underlying processor architecture, which has long powered smartphones and their small batteries. Microsoft granted Qualcomm an exclusivity arrangement to develop Windows-compatible chips until 2024, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Microsoft has encouraged others to enter the market once that exclusivity deal expires, the two sources told Reuters.
“Microsoft learned from the 90s that they don’t want to be dependent on Intel again, they don’t want to be dependent on a single vendor,” said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, a finance and strategy consulting firm. “If Arm really took off in PC (chips), they were never going to let Qualcomm be the sole supplier.”

Microsoft has been encouraging the involved chipmakers to build advanced AI features into the CPUs they are designing. The company envisions AI-enhanced software such as its Copilot to become an increasingly important part of using Windows. To make that a reality, forthcoming chips from Nvidia, AMD and others will need to devote the on-chip resources to do so.
There is no guarantee of success if Microsoft and the chip firms proceed with the plans. Software developers have spent decades and billions of dollars writing code for Windows that runs on what is known as the x86 computing architecture, which is used by both Intel and AMD. Computer code built for x86 chips will not automatically run on Arm-based designs, and the transition could pose challenges.
Intel has also been packing AI features into its chips and recently showed a laptop running features similar to ChatGPT directly on the device.

Chinese retailers offer deep iPhone 15 discounts,Analysts say the iPhone 15 has not been selling as well in China as its predecessor.,"Chinese e-commerce platforms including JD.com, PDD Holdings’ Pinduoduo and Alibaba’s Taobao are offering big discounts on Apple’s latest iPhone 15, with some going for up to 1,501 yuan ($205.14) below the retail price.
Analysts say the iPhone 15 has not been selling as well in China as its predecessor. Counterpoint Research said last week that iPhone 15 sales in China were down 4.5% compared with the iPhone 14, in the first 17 days after its market launch.
In China, Apple occasionally allows partner vendors to offer discounts to spur demand. But Chinese e-commerce platforms have also been locked in a “value for money” battle as consumers tighten their belts in a slowing economy, with discounting a key focus of an upcoming annual Singles Day shopping festival.

Google Pixel 8 review: Don’t let the small size fool you,The Google Pixel 8 showcases the power of artificial intelligence in enhancing the overall experience of a smartphone.,"It may not carry the “Pro” label, but it doesn’t need that to be tempting. The Pixel 8 Pro has surpassed the Rs 1,00,000 price point for the first time, making it a tough sell for many people. Meanwhile, priced at Rs 75,999 and boasting some significant improvements over its predecessor, the Pixel 8 emerges as the more attractive option, at least in my opinion. Here’s my review after using it for a week.
Things I immediately noticed
In an era where 6.7-inch screens have become the norm, the Google Pixel 8 feels like a step backwards – and I love it. The handset distinguishes itself with its more manageable 6.2-inch screen, offering a refreshing return to sanity in a world of massive phablets. As someone who has grappled with 6.7-inch devices for years, this downsizing felt like a relief. It essentially convinced me that my next phone won’t be any larger than 6.3 inches.

Microsoft Excel gets better at handling scientific data,"The new update is based on the feature of automatic data conversion, which Microsoft introduced last year, where, when disabled, Excel will notify users about automatic data conversion.","Microsoft has added a new capability to Excel, which makes it easy for scientists to use various alphanumeric symbols and the update is being rolled out to Windows and Mac users. With this update, Excel no longer automatically converts gene numbers and other scientific data as dates and allows scientists to use proper data within the Excel app.
This shortcoming made scientists rename genes, which again had to be reworked at the time of publishing, which would otherwise ruin the data. The new update is based on the automatic data conversion feature, which Microsoft introduced last year, where, when disabled, Excel offers more control over automatic data conversion.

I have been using the Apple Watch Ultra 2 over the past couple of weeks, having moved here after closing the Apple Watch Series 9 review. The Watch Ultra 2 is also powered by the new S9 processor, like the Series 9, which means there is much more power inside than before. And there are some new features like the double tap gesture, which will add a new level of functionality to the watch but will be available only a few weeks later for Indian users. That part of the review will have to wait for now.

"Why you need Dolby Atmos, the sound technology that brings movies to life",What is Dolby Atmos and how can it make your movies sound more realistic?,"You know how an HDR screen can make a movie look much better and more realistic? Well, there’s a way to do the same thing for sound, not just video. It’s called Dolby Atmos, and it’s a technology that creates a three-dimensional sound field for movies, making you feel like you’re surrounded by the action. In this article, we’ll explain what Dolby Atmos is, how it works, and why you should give it a try.
What is Dolby Atmos?
Dolby Atmos is a sound technology that creates a three-dimensional audio experience. Unlike traditional surround sound systems, Dolby Atmos does not simply assign sounds to specific channels or speakers. Instead, it also treats each sound as an individual object that can be placed anywhere in the room, including above the listener’s head.

OnePlus Open vs Galaxy Z Fold 5: Is Samsung’s dominance under threat?,"The foldable phone market is heating up with the arrival of the OnePlus Open, a device that claims to have “3 main cameras” and a near-invisible crease. But does it stack up against the Galaxy Z Fold 5?","Foldable devices are the hottest trend in the smartphone market, and we are seeing more and more brands launching their own versions of this innovative form factor. The Galaxy Z Fold, which is widely considered the best foldable phone available, now faces a serious contender: the OnePlus Open. How do these two devices compare, and which one is worth the money? Let’s find out.
Design and size
The Galaxy Z Fold 5 may have a fancy form factor, but it doesn’t go overboard with its design. It has a sleek and minimal look that suits its professional appeal. The back of the phone features a neat triple camera setup that is unmistakably Samsung, and the device has a rather slim profile when shut – it almost feels like holding a TV remote.

OpenAI shelves Arrakis AI: All you need to know about model named after desert in ‘Dune’,The researchers working on Arrakis AI decided to shelve the project as its performance was inefficient.,"Ever since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the world has never been the same.

OpenAI which introduced ChatGPT based on its Large Language Model (LLM) GPT-3 went on to update the chatbot with its advanced version, the GPT-4.

Scientists spot most distant ‘fast radio burst’ recorded in history,"A new study that documented the most distant ""fast radio burst"" in history says that FRBs can be used to measure the mass of the universe.","Researchers discovered a remote blast of cosmic radio waves that lasted less than a millisecond in June last year. This “fast radio burst” is the most distant ever detected and its source is in a galaxy so far away that it took eight billion years to reach us. It is also one of the most energetic ones ever observed. In a fraction of a second, it released the equivalent of 30 years of emissions from our Sun.
This discovery confirms that FRBs (fast radio bursts) can be used to measure “missing” matter between galaxies and can provide a new way to “weigh” the Universe, according to the European Southern Observatory. (ESO) Current methods of estimating the universe’s mass give conflicting answers and challenge the standard model of cosmology.

OnePlus Open review: Reaping the late mover advantage in foldables,The OnePlus Open has a lot of style and oozes a sense of confidence which reminds me of the first OnePlus phone which made me a fan of the brand. Here's my review.,"Smartphone companies are clearly feeling the pressure of being left behind in the foldable race. And this is why every brand worth its salt wants to launch its own fold or flip phone before more enter the race. This new form factor also offers companies the opportunity to charge more from their consumers than what their regular phones can do. The latest to enter this bandwagon is OnePlus with the Open.

OnePlus Open review
At first sight, the OnePlus Open is undoubtedly the sleekest foldable phone I have seen. And it is not just about being sleek. This phone has a lot of style and oozes a sense of confidence which reminds me of the first OnePlus phone which made me a fan of the brand. The phone also has a somewhat serious design, the sort you would feel when holding a BlackBerry all those years back. And this could well be the advantage OnePlus wants to play on, given that the foldable segment automatically caters to an upper crest in the smartphone segment.

Smartphone-killer wearable Ai Pin from Humane is here: Everything we know so far,"The wearable AI assistant was recently spotted at the Paris Fashion Week, where supermodels wore it in their outfits.","A few months ago, we told you how a new innovation in AI is about to change the way we communicate. AI company, Humane, founded by Apple veterans Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, had demonstrated a projector-based wearable AI assistant that could potentially replace smartphones in the future. Recently, the company gave the first glimpse of this futuristic device.  
The device known as Ai Pin turned heads at Paris Fashion Week which was held earlier this month. The device caught attention after supermodel Naomi Campbell walked down the runway. Reportedly, Humane in collaboration with French luxury brand Coperni showcased the Ai Pin.
The device has been described as a screenless, standalone device and software built exclusively for AI. It is made to project phone-like interfaces and information onto surfaces, and even speak to the user.

What exactly is Ai Pin?
At the show, the device was seen on the lapels of the garments worn by Campbell and other models. Ai Pin uses a wide range of sensors that allow natural and intuitive interactions. The device has been designed to fuse itself effortlessly into the everyday lives of its users. According to the makers, Ai Pin prioritises privacy and has no wake word or ‘always on’ listening features.

Interestingly, the device does not need to be paired with a smartphone or any other device. It reportedly features AI-powered optical recognition and a display that is projected via laser. Ai Pin is powered by an advanced Snapdragon platform. Coming to the look and feel of the device it is a small square box with rounded-off edges. The front panel is white and has a cutout that seems like a Dynamic Island. On the rear, it has stainless steel which resembles Apple products of a bygone era.

By the look of it, the Ai Pin seems to be a luxury device, especially since the makers partnered with the luxury designer brand Coperni. So far there is no information on how much it would cost. The company announced the name of the product in June this year. “We are excited to reveal our first device will be called the Humane Ai Pin. Our Ai Pin presents an opportunity for people to take AI with them everywhere and to unlock a new era of personal mobile computing which is seamless, screenless and sensing,” Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno said in an official statement.

"Nokia to cut up to 14,000 jobs as US demand shrinks, growth uncertain","We simply don't know when market will recover, says CEO.","Nokia will cut up to 14,000 jobs to reduce costs, it said on Thursday, warning it did not expect a market recovery soon after posting a 20% drop in third-quarter sales on weaker demand for 5G equipment.
Shares in the Finnish company, which produces equipment for telecom networks, were down 2% at 0900 GMT.
A slowdown in the United States, home to Verizon and AT&T, and one of the more profitable markets for Nokia and Ericsson had forced them to look for growth in other regions such as India. But now India is also expected to normalize after a stellar 2022.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The market situation is really challenging and it is witnessed by the fact that in our most important market, which is the North American market, our net sales are down 40% in Q3,” Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark told Reuters in an interview.
Nokia is targeting savings of between 800 million euros ($842 million) and 1.2 billion euros by 2026.
It expects to reduce its employee base to between 72,000 and 77,000 employees, from 86,000, or about 16% job cuts at the high end.
Lundmark declined to give more details saying the company must consult first with employee representatives. However, he said he wanted to protect research and development.
ADVERTISEMENT
Nokia expects at least 400 million euros of savings in 2024, and a further 300 million euros in 2025.
Ericsson, which has also laid off thousands of employees this year, said on Tuesday the uncertainty affecting its business would persist into 2024.
Nokia, which echoed Ericsson’s comments on uncertainty, however said there will be a more normal seasonal improvement in its network businesses in the fourth quarter.
The company did not cut its full-year outlook.
“We continue to believe in the mid-to-long-term market, but we are not going to sit and wait and pray that the market will recover anytime soon,” Lundmark said. “We simply don’t know when it will recover.”
ADVERTISEMENT
5G was touted as an industry that was meant to start the age of automation and driverless cars but businesses have been slow to adopt the new technology.
With slow growth, telecom operators have been struggling with their investment budgets and embarked on their own cost cuts. Earlier this year, Britain’s BT Group had announced plans to cut 55,000 jobs while Vodafone has plans to cut 11,000 positions.
“This should be an industry that’s flying high, buoyed by unrelenting demand for its services … instead, countless questions continue to be posed around operators’ relevance and long-term future,” said CCS Insight analyst Kester Mann.
For market recovery, Lundmark said the industry needs to invest in faster mid-band equipment to help cope with the growth in data traffic. “Only 25% of 5G base stations in the world outside of China currently has mid-band,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Mid-band equipment offers higher 5G speeds but many telecom operators started their 5G deployment with low-band gear that is cheaper but offers lower speeds.
“There are signs here and there that demand would start to pick up again but it’s too early to call it a broad-based trend,” Lundmark said.
Quarterly comparable net sales fell to 4.98 billion euros from 6.24 billion last year, missing an estimate of 5.67 billion euros according to a LSEG poll.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/nokia-to-cut-up-to-14000-jobs-as-us-demand-shrinks-growth-uncertain-8990766/,technology

The video-sharing platform also introduced a new ‘You’ tab that combines the existing ‘Library’ tab and account page.
In a recent blog post, YouTube said that the decision to merge the account page and Library tab was made to make it easy for users to find all their stuff in one place. The new ‘You’ tab replaces the ‘Library’ tab that resides in the right corner of the bottom navigation bar. YouTube also made some changes to the ‘Like’ and ‘Subscribe’ buttons, which now glow and have a fancy sparkle animation when you tap on them.
Lock screen while watching videos
As for the new features, YouTube users will now be able to avoid accidental taps with the new lock screen feature. Available on both mobile and tablets, it can be used to prevent unintentional taps and swipes during video playback.

To lock the screen, go to the video you want to watch, press the gear icon on the top right and tap on ‘Screen lock’. Unlocking is fairly easy as the lock icon can be made visible by tapping anywhere on the screen. However, Google notes that some in-app notifications or ads might temporarily disable the feature.

Clicking on these recommendations will take users to the search results page so they can easily visit the website they want to.
Chrome will also automatically complete URLs based on your past search terms when trying to find a website. Until now, the app could only autocomplete the URL if users typed them from the beginning.

Now, users can simply type in ‘flights’ and Chrome will automatically complete the web address for you.

"Netflix raises prices and adds subscribers, despite strikes",The price hikes were announced in an earnings report that showed the company's global subscriber base reached 247 million at the end of September.,"Netflix increased subscription prices for some streaming plans in the United States, Britain and France on Wednesday as it shattered expectations for new customers, sending its shares surging 13%.
Almost 9 million subscribers joined Netflix around the globe in the third quarter, surpassing Wall Street analysts’ forecast for 6 million, according to LSEG. Netflix said it expected a similar number of additions in the current quarter.
The strong performance showed Netflix was thriving despite Hollywood labor tensions that shut down a large swath of U.S. production. Netflix makes many of its shows and movies overseas, which accounted for the bulk of its new sign-ups.
ADVERTISEMENT
Netflix pointed to the global success of “One Piece,” a live-action adaptation of the venerable Japanese manga series and an example of its hefty investment in stories with local resonance that travel the world. The streaming giant also attracted new audiences to long-running television shows, such as the legal drama “Suits,” which it licensed from Comcast , and HBO’s World War Two series “Band of Brothers.”

“These are the times I’m glad we have such a rich and deep and broad programming selection,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said after the release of the quarterly results. “The same was true during COVID, when we were able to manage the slate through a prolonged and pretty unpredictable production interruption.”
Hollywood’s film and television writers ratified a new contract this month, but actors remain on strike. Sarandos said Netflix was “totally committed to ending this strike.”
The company’s third-quarter customer gains represented its strongest quarterly uptick since the second quarter of 2020, when lockdowns early in the global pandemic led to an unprecedented surge in streaming subscriptions.
ADVERTISEMENT
Netflix increased the U.S. price of its premium ad-free plan by $3 per month to $22.99. The cost for premium rose by 2 pounds to 17.99 pounds in Britain and by 2 euros to 19.99 euros in France.
Investors welcomed the news, sending Netflix shares climbing to $390.80 in extended trading from a close of $346.19.
PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said the third-quarter growth at Netflix was a testament to its recent crackdown on password sharing and the opportunities for growth as it moves into advertising.
“It is firing on all cylinders, with recent efforts all heading in the right direction,” he said.

GLOBAL GAINS
The price hikes were announced in an earnings report that showed the company’s global subscriber base reached 247 million at the end of September.
Substantial subscriber gains came in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where Netflix added nearly 4 million subscribers. More than 70% of its members now reside outside the United States.
During the quarter, “Suits” became the most-watched title across film, original TV and acquired TV on streaming in the U.S. for 12 straight weeks after it hit Netflix. The series, starring Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, originally aired on the USA cable network from 2011 to 2019.
“As the competitive environment evolves, we may have increased opportunities to license more hit titles,” Netflix said in its quarterly letter to shareholders.
ADVERTISEMENT
The company posted revenue of $8.54 billion, in line with analyst forecasts. Earnings came in at $3.73 per share, ahead of Wall Street’s expectation of $3.49.
Netflix’s forecast for fourth-quarter revenue of $8.69 billion was slightly below analysts’ estimates of $8.77 billion.
The writer and actor strikes prompted Netflix to revise its projections on content spending to $13 billion in 2023, assuming the studios reach a settlement with striking actors “in the near future.”
That was down from the $17 billion it expected to spend.

Netflix said it continued to dominate viewership.

How to choose the right Apple Pencil for your iPad: A comparison of the 3 models,"Apple has just released a new entry-level stylus for iPads: the Apple Pencil USB-C. How does it compare to the first and second-gen models? We break down the differences in dimensions, features, connectivity, and compatibility.","The Apple Pencil is one of those rare Apple products that can go years without getting a refresh. The first generation debuted in 2015, followed by the second generation in 2018. And now, almost five years later, we have a new entry-level stylus for iPads: the Apple Pencil USB-C. But this is not a replacement for the previous models – it’s actually an alternative that coexists with them. So how do you choose the right one for your needs? Let’s compare the three options and see what they offer.
Dimensions
The first thing you may notice about the new Apple Pencil (USB-C) is that it is shorter and thinner than the old models. The Apple Pencil (1st generation), which was released has a length of 6.92 inches and a diameter of 0.35 inches, making it similar to a real pencil in size and shape. The Apple Pencil (2nd generation), which came out in 2018, was slightly shorter at 6.53 inches, but kept the same diameter of 0.35 inches.

Scientists reveal source of most powerful marsquake in history,The most powerful marsquake ever recorded in 2022 and scientists have now revealed what caused it.,"Just like on Earth, the surface of Mars sometimes vigorously shakes and unsurprisingly, that is called a marsquake. The largest ever marsquake recorded in history happened in 2022 and scientists now finally know the reason behind it.
A study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters on Tuesday rules out the possibility that the marsquake was caused by a meteor impact. The quake had a magnitude of 4.7 and since its seismic signal was similar to previous quakes that were caused by meteoroid impacts, scientists initially believed that it might have been caused by an impact as well. This launched an international search for a fresh crater at the time.

Beware of ‘Spynet’: The stealthy Android spyware that steals private data,"Spynet is a bit smarter than most spyware apps, as it does not leave any traces of itself, which makes it difficult to spot. In fact, the app does not even appear on the home screen or the recent apps tab.","F-Secure, a cybersecurity company, has published a report on a harmful Android app Spynet. Being called spyware, the app spreads by smishing technique (SMS phishing) and then goes on to steal users’ personal data, which includes, but is not limited to, accessing SMS and recording calls.
The app isn’t listed on the Google Play Store; instead, it spreads through smishing. When the user clicks on a harmful link, the app gets installed on the phone and takes control of the device. As it is not listed on the Play Store, it does not come under Google Play Protect’s radar.

X social media to test $1 annual subscription for basic features,"The new subscription termed as ""Not A Bot"" will charge users for likes, reposts or quoting other accounts' posts, and bookmarking posts on the web version of the platform.","Social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, said on Tuesday it will test a new subscription model under which it will charge $1 annual fee for basic features.
The new subscription termed as “Not A Bot” will charge users for likes, reposts or quoting other accounts’ posts, and bookmarking posts on the web version of the platform.
The purpose of introducing the new subscription model is to combat bots and spammers, X said, adding that the fee will vary from country to country based on the exchange rate.

X said the new method will be first available for users in New Zealand and Philippines.Within this test, existing users are not affected. But new users who would not wish to subscribe will only be able to view and read posts, watch videos and follow accounts.
Bots have been a contentious issue for Elon Musk who acquired the company last year. In July, X had introduced a limit on viewing tweets, “to ensure the authenticity” of its user base.
Earlier this month, Reuters had reported citing a source that X CEO Linda Yaccarino met with X’s lenders, in which she had said the company would test three tiers of its subscription service based on the number of ads shown to the user.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/x-social-media-to-test-1-annual-subscription-for-basic-features-8988279/,technology
"Biden cuts China off from more Nvidia chips, expands curbs to other countries","The rules, which go into effect in 30 days, restrict a broader swathe of advanced chips and chipmaking tools to a greater number of countries including Iran and Russia, and blacklist Chinese chip designers Moore Threads and Biren.","The Biden administration plans to halt shipments to China of more advanced artificial intelligence chips designed by Nvidia and others, part of a raft of measures released on Tuesday that seek to stop Beijing from receiving cutting-edge U.S. technologies to strengthen its military.
The rules, which go into effect in 30 days, restrict a broader swathe of advanced chips and chipmaking tools to a greater number of countries including Iran and Russia, and blacklist Chinese chip designers Moore Threads and Biren.
The new measures close loopholes in regulations released last October and will probably be updated “at least annually,” Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters late on Monday.
ADVERTISEMENT
The goal is to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to (Chinese) military applications,” she said, stressing the administration was not seeking to hurt Beijing economically. She said China will still import hundred of billions of dollars worth of U.S. semiconductors.
A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said it “firmly opposes” the new restrictions, adding that “arbitrarily placing curbs or forcibly seeking decoupling to serve (a) political agenda violates the principles of market economy and fair competition (and) undermines the international economic and trading order.”
REPORT FINDS U.S. AI FEEDS CHINA’S MILITARY
The new measures demonstrate the Biden administration is struggling to slow the flow of chips and chipmaking tools into China, even as concerns mount over the role U.S. technology is playing in modernizing Beijing’s military.
Reuters reported in June that the very AI chips barred by prior regulations could be purchased from vendors in China’s Shenzhen.
ADVERTISEMENT
Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology found in a June 2022 report that out of 97 individual AI chips procured via Chinese military tenders over an 8-month period in 2020, nearly all of them were designed by Nvidia, Xilinx, Intel, and Microsemi.
AI capabilities, aided by supercomputing and advanced chips, improve the speed and accuracy of military decision-making, planning and logistics, according to the regulations released Tuesday.
CHINA-ONLY CHIPS HIT
In a statement following publication of the rules, top U.S. AI chip designer Nvidia said it complies with regulations and does not expect a meaningful hit to near-term results.
Nvidia’s business has soared since the imposition of last year’s rules because its China-only chips are still better than alternatives. The firm is currently selling almost every chip it can procure as worldwide demand outstrips supply, but would be hurt in the long term as Chinese chip firms look elsewhere to fill any voids left by U.S. companies.
ADVERTISEMENT
The company has made chips such as the A800 and H800 that walked up to the line of the previous rules to continue selling to China, and AMD, also impacted by the rules, has said it plans a similar strategy.
Nvidia’s shares fell 3.7%, while shares in AMD and another rival AI chipmaker, Intel, slid 0.6% and 1% respectively.
The new rules will exempt most consumer chips used in laptops, smartphones and gaming, though some will be subject to licensing and notification requirements by U.S. officials.
TAKING ON CHIPLET TECHNOLOGY
The previous rules imposed a two-pronged test that measured both a chip’s computing performance and its ability to communicate with other chips, an important measure in AI supercomputers where thousands of chips are strung together to chew through huge amounts of data.
ADVERTISEMENT
Nvidia and Intel created special chips for the Chinese market that retained the powerful computing capabilities but limited communications speeds to stay inside the previous rules.
The new rules impose limits on how much computing power a chip packs into a certain size, a measure designed to prevent workarounds using new “chiplet” technology that China has said will be central to its semiconductor industry’s future.
Chinese firms Biren and Moore Threads, whose U.S. suppliers will now face a tough licensing requirement before shipping products to them, are both startups founded by former Nvidia employees and aim to compete with the U.S. AI chip giant.
Biren said it firmly opposes its blacklisting and will appeal to the U.S. government to reexamine the decision. Moore Threads said it strongly disagrees with its addition to the trade blacklist.
ADVERTISEMENT
LICENSING EXPANDED
The new measures also expand licensing requirements for exports of advanced chips to more than 40 additional countries that present risks of diversion to China and are subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
That measure appears to build on a letter received by Nvidia in August that it described as restricting shipments of its A100 and H100 chips beyond China to other regions including some countries in the Middle East.
Confirming a Reuters report, chips will be barred from being sent to units of firms located anywhere in the world if their parent companies are headquartered in China, Macau and other arms embargoed countries.
The Biden administration also hit 21 countries outside China with a licensing requirement for chipmaking tools, over fears the equipment could be diverted to China and other national security concerns.
ADVERTISEMENT
It also added to the list of equipment restricted from going to that country to include some deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems, going beyond recent Dutch regulations to keep the Netherlands’ ASML from sending older DUV models and spare parts to some advanced Chinese chip factories, confirming another Reuters report.
DUV is less advanced chipmaking equipment than state-of-the art extreme ultraviolet equipment (EUV), which has already been withheld from China, but can make chips nearly as advanced at a greater cost.
ASML said in a statement the new measures would likely have an impact on “the regional split of our system sales” over the medium to long-term, but the company did not expect to see a “material impact” on its financial outlook for 2023 or the longer term.
Shares of rival U.S. equipment makers Lam Research was flat while Applied Materials traded up 0.6% and KLA down 1.3%.”We don’t think incremental semiconductor equipment restrictions are likely to have significant long term effects” on equipment suppliers, Wolfe Research said in a client note.
ADVERTISEMENT
KLA declined to comment. Lam and Applied did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
U.S. officials said Chinese counterparts were warned the rules were coming by Raimondo, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, confirming a Reuters report.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement it was “evaluating the impact” of the new rules and urged the administration to work with allies. “Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security,” the group said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/biden-cuts-china-off-from-more-nvidia-chips-expands-curbs-to-other-countries-8988266/,technology

Snapchat announces new features to protect teenagers from online risks,Snapchat will soon show a pop-up for teenagers whenever someone they might not know tries to contact them on the platform.,"Snapchat is getting a bunch of new features aimed at protecting teenagers from potential online risks. The company says it will be implementing a new strike system and detection technologies to remove accounts that market or promote inappropriate content to teens.
As part of its latest efforts, the upcoming features will protect teens from being contacted by people they haven’t interacted with in real life and will provide a much-improved age-appropriate viewing content experience.
Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat says a pop-up warning will appear for teenagers if people who they don’t have mutual contacts with or someone they don’t know tries to add them. The app will also offer a quick way for teens to report or block strangers.

Is your Android smartphone keeping up? Ranking brands for software updates,Android is catching up with Apple in software support. Find out which brands offer the best update policies in 2023.,"One of the main reasons why some people prefer the Apple ecosystem over Android is the long-term software support that the company offers. Apple devices can receive updates for many years, sometimes even longer than their hardware lifespan. On the other hand, Android handsets have a reputation for being quickly abandoned by their manufacturers, with generally no updates beyond three years.
However, this is no longer the case. As people keep their phones for longer, Android manufacturers have realised the importance of building brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. Led by Samsung, many of these companies have started to provide update support for over half a decade – and some like Fairphone have actually managed to beat Apple at its own game with eight years of support.

"Our prehistoric ancestors turned stones into spheres on purpose, finds study",The years-long mystery of whether our ancestors intentionally carved spheroids or created them accidentally as a by-product of other work might now be solved.,"Early ancestors of humans intentionally turned limestone into “spheroids” more than 1.4 million years ago, finds a new study. While part of the mystery of the spheroids that perplexed archaeologists for years is now solved, we still don’t know why they were made.
For years, scientists have deliberated on how the spheroids were created—did our ancient ancestors deliberately work on them trying to create perfect spheres or are they just the byproduct of other work that could involve smashing stones together?
To find out, researchers used cutting-edge analysis techniques on 150 limestone spheroids from the Ubeidiya archaeological site that date back to around 1.4 million years ago. The researchers reconstructed the reduction of the spheroid based on the geometry of and the scar facets on the stones. The findings proved contrary to the notion that they were accidental by-products.

Instead of becoming smoother as they were being made, the scars were becoming more and more spherical. This is important because while it is possible for stones to become smoother naturally with erosion, like with pebbles, they rarely ever achieve an ideal spherical shape. This conversion towards an ideal spherical shape required shaping skills and a clear goal.
This discovery is important because it challenges existing notions of early hominins (our ancestors) and their relationship with technologies. Slightly older spheroids exist at sites in Africa and if the same intentionality can be demonstrated over there, it would represent the oldest evidence of hominings looking for and achieving symmetrical shapes in stone.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/prehistoric-ancestors-turned-stones-into-spheres-8929138/,technology
Watch how hackers use Flipper Zero to spam iPhone users with Bluetooth pop-ups,Flipper Zero can be used to send several annoying Bluetooth pop-ups on iOS devices like iPhone and iPad and render the devices nearly unusable.,"Flipper Zero, a tiny piece of hardware that can interact with any type of RFID, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled devices can be used by hackers to spam iPhone users with relentless Bluetooth pop-ups by imitating devices like AirPods, AppleTV, and AirTags.
According to a recent report by TechCrunch, a security researcher named ‘Anthony’ demonstrated a denial of service attack using Flipper Zero, sending several Bluetooth pop-ups on the victim’s phone which rendered it almost unusable. It is to be noted that the attack can be imitated on any iOS device.
The exploit worked without any issues even when Bluetooth was turned off from the Control Center or the device was in airplane mode, but when the radio was turned off from the ‘Settings’ app, Flipper Zero couldn’t bombard the iPhone with pop-ups.

The security researcher said he modified the Flipper Zero firmware to imitate ‘Bluetooth Advertisements’, which is basically a type of transmission that Apple uses to connect devices like an Apple Watch or send pictures using file-sharing features like AirDrop. He went on to claim that the attack can also work over a wide range using an amplified board, but refused to share details citing security reasons.

TechCrunch says it used the firmware shared by Anthony to display a phone number transfer dialogue using Flipper Zero, with the device capturing several iPhones at the same time even when it was kept on the other side of the room.
A blog post on GitHub by ‘Techryptic’ suggests Flipper Zero can be programmed to carry out wireless attacks not only on iPhones, but can also target other devices like RFID cards and smart car keys.
While Flipper Zero requires users to be in proximity to the device, the attacks demonstrated by the security researcher give us an idea of how such exploits could be used to steal information from Apple devices.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/flipper-zero-iphone-spam-bluetooth-pop-ups-8928952/,technology

“Innovation is easier with a relatively small team that has to make a decisive and clear concentrated bet and that doesn’t tolerate any mediocre performers. that’s it,” he was quoted as saying at the event. 
Well, this is just not it, the CEO went on to share his thoughts on a myriad of topics spanning from philosophical implications of AI to some pragmatic advice to budding startups. The conversation and its snippets have been going viral ever since. 
Humanity in the age of AI
During the interaction, Altman asserted the impact of superintelligence on humanity. He said that while it is intelligence that differentiates humans from other beings, it’s not merely computational ability that sets us apart. 
With AI evolving at a rapid pace, Altman feels that humans will adapt and redefine themselves, in similar ways they did at the time of earlier technological revolutions like the industrial and computer revolution. This perspective is likely to challenge humans to think about the place they occupy in a world where machines will overtake various forms of intelligence.

Even though the risks of AI are central to all the ongoing conversations, Altman focussed mostly on the positive potentials of the technology. He expressed a desire for more discussions on the ‘upside scenarios’ of AI. Technology when guided by the right principles has the potential to offer unprecedented levels of prosperity and well-being.
Governance and education
The conversation largely centred around the governance of super intelligence with the CEO emphasising the need for developing the right incentive structures. Altman believes that the governance of AI should be decentralised and that the world deserves governance over such a powerful resource. Interestingly, this is quite a departure from a centralised model of governance for AI which often dominates conversations. 
During his interaction, Altman also expressed his excitement about the role of AI in education. He foresees a future where AI can provide individual tutoring for every child which could bridge the widespread educational gap. 
Altman also said that he sees huge potential in accelerating the rate of scientific progress. The CEO believes that scientific and technological advancements are the only sustainable means to improve the quality of life. Altman feels AI could be a catalyst in this direction as it could well assist researchers with various breakthroughs.

AI for all
Talking about making AI accessible for all, Altman said that OpenAI is working towards creating a system that allows people to specify the behaviour they want in simple English. Apart from talking about the importance of having small teams, Altman also said that choosing the right people for a startup was equally important. He emphasised the importance of raw talent, a shared commitment to the grand mission and to contributing to the company’s net output.

UNESCO seeks regulation in first guidance on GenAI use in education,"Students have also taken a liking for GenAI, which can generate anything from essays to mathematical calculations with just a few line of prompts.","UNESCO on Thursday published its first guidance on use of Generative AI (GenAI) for education, urging governmental agencies to regulate the use of the technology, including protection of data privacy and putting an age limit for users.
Launched by Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November, GenAI chatbot ChatGPT has become the world’s fastest growing app to date, and its emergence has prompted the release of rivals, such as Google’s Bard.
Students have also taken a liking for GenAI, which can generate anything from essays to mathematical calculations with just a few line of prompts.

“We are struggling to align the speed of transformation of the education system to the speed of the change in technological progress and advancement in these machine learning models,” Stefania Giannini, assistant director-general for education, told Reuters.
“In many cases, governments and schools are embracing a radically unfamiliar technology that even leading technologists do not claim to understand,” she said.
Among a series of guidelines in a 64-page report, UNESCO stressed on the need for government-sanctioned AI curricula for school education, in technical and vocational education and training.
“GenAI providers should be held responsible for ensuring adherence to core values and lawful purposes, respecting intellectual property, and upholding ethical practices, while also preventing the spread of disinformation and hate speech,” UNESCO said.

It also called for prevention of GenAI where it would deprive learners of opportunities to develop cognitive abilities and social skills through observations of the real world, empirical practices such as experiments, discussions with other humans, and independent logical reasoning.
While China has formulated rules on GenAI, the European Union’s AI Act is likely to be approved later this year. Other countries are far behind in drafting their own AI laws.
The Paris-based agency also sought to protect the rights of teachers and researchers and the value of their practices when using GenAI.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/unesco-seeks-regulation-in-first-guidance-on-genai-use-in-education-8928608/,technology

Hunyuan’s debut comes after several Chinese tech firms including Baidu Inc and SenseTime Group recently unveiled their own AI models.
Tencent, China’s most valuable internet company, said Hunyuan had more than 100 billion parameters and was trained with more than 2 trillion tokens, two metrics often used to measure AI models’ power.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 AI model contained 175 billion parameters in 2020 and Meta Platform Inc’s Llama 2 model had 70 billion parameters in 2023.
Tencent said its model, capable of conversing in both Chinese and English, was “better” than OpenAI’s ChatGPT in areas such as writing long text with thousands of words and solving certain math problems.

Google reaches tentative settlement in US Play Store lawsuit,They argue that Google has unlawfully mandated that some apps use the company's payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales.,"Alphabet’s Google on Tuesday tentatively settled a class action suit alleging that its U.S. Play Store had violated U.S. federal antitrust rules by overcharging customers, according to a court filing.
Details of the settlement were not disclosed.
In the action brought by more than 30 U.S. states and representing 21 million consumers, the plaintiffs had claimed that consumers might have spent less on apps and had more options if it weren’t for Google’s alleged monopoly.
Parties to the settlement, including lawyers representing the attorney general for Utah which is leading the group of states, asked that a trial scheduled for Nov. 6 be canceled.

Google, which had denied wrongdoing, declined to comment on the proposed settlement. Lawyers for the consumer plaintiffs declined to comment on the proposed settlement, while a lawyer for plaintiffs that include the states and the District of Columbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement is subject to approval by the court.
Google is facing similar lawsuits which allege that it has generated enormous profit margins from its Play Store by engaging in illegal tactics to preserve monopolies in selling Android apps and in-app goods.
They argue that Google has unlawfully mandated that some apps use the company’s payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales.
Epic Games, which has brought such a claim, is not a party to the proposed Google Play settlement, founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Microsoft says compromise of its engineer’s account led to Chinese hack of US officials,"Microsoft said the engineer's account had been penetrated by a hacking group it dubs Storm-0558, which is alleged to have stolen hundreds of thousands of emails from top American officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.","The recently disclosed Chinese hack of senior officials at the U.S. State and Commerce departments stemmed from the compromise of a Microsoft engineer’s corporate account, Microsoft Corp said in a blog post on Wednesday.
Microsoft said the engineer’s account had been penetrated by a hacking group it dubs Storm-0558, which is alleged to have stolen hundreds of thousands of emails from top American officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Kritenbrink.
The blog post addressed some unanswered questions around the incident, which drew fresh scrutiny to Microsoft’s security and led to calls to investigate the company’s practices.

Notably, the post explained how hackers were able to extract a cryptographic key from the engineer’s account and use it to access email accounts that it should not have given them access to.
Microsoft said it had fixed the flaws that led to the key being accessible from the unidentified engineer’s account which gave the hackers such wide latitude to steal emails. A Microsoft representative said the engineer’s account had been hit using “token-stealing malware” but did not provide further detail about the incident or its timing.

Scientists make furthest detection of galaxy’s magnetic field in history,Astronomers may have made what is the farthest detection of a galaxy's magnetic field in human history.,"Scientists have detected the magnetic field of a galaxy so far away that it took more than 11 billion years ago. The discovery, made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), shows the galaxy as it was when the universe was just 2.5 billion years old.
Many celestial bodies have magnetic fields of their own; from stars and planets to entire galaxies. “Many people might not be aware that our entire galaxy and other galaxies are laced with magnetic fields, spanning tens of thousands of light-years,” said James Geach, professor of astrophysics at the University of Hertfordshire, in a press statement.

Big Tech’s core businesses face overhaul under EU tech rules,"Affected firms include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple , Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok owner ByteDance.","The EU Commission on Wednesday designated 22 services of six major tech companies as “gatekeepers” of online services providing messaging to video sharing in its latest crackdown on Big Tech.
The firms are Alphabet, Amazon, Apple , Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance.
Under the DMA, which came into force in November, companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros ($82 billion) are considered gatekeepers providing a core platform service.

Businesses labelled as such will be required to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.
Alphabet’s Google had the highest number of services, including Android operating system, Maps and Search, which would face tougher rules. Meta’s Facebook, Instagram, Marketplace and WhatsApp also qualified as gatekeepers.
The companies will have six months to demonstrate their compliance with their obligations and can be fined up to 10% of their annual global turnover for DMA violations.
Gatekeepers could ask for an interim measure to suspend the application of the rules but they would need to launch a legal case in the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg to do that, a senior Commission official said. “We haven’t seen anything like that so far.”

Following the introduction of separate legislation, the Digital Services Act, Zalando took the Commission to court in June.
“It’s D-Day for #DMA!,” EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “The most impactful online companies will now have to play by our EU rules.”
A Microsoft spokesperson said it accepts its gatekeeper designation, while Meta, Google and Amazon spokespersons said they were reviewing the designations.

TikTok said it “fundamentally disagree with this decision” and “disappointed that no market investigation was conducted prior to this decision and are evaluating our next steps.”
An Apple spokesperson said the company remained “very concerned about the privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users.”
The iPhone maker had earlier raised concerns that the DMA would lead to more installing of apps that do not come via Apple’s App Store, or “side-loading”.
“The Commission should balance the need to protect user security and privacy with the very real risk that gatekeeper app stores will use security and privacy as excuses to dilute compliance with their DMA obligations,” said Stavroula Vryna, partner at law firm Clifford Chance.

Alphabet’s Gmail, Microsoft’s Outlook and Samsung’s browser were exempted after the companies provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gatekeepers, the Commission said.
The Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft’s and Apple’s submissions that some of their core platforms such as Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising, and Apple’s iMessage services do not qualify as gateways.

The results of the study published in the journal Science show that there was a major population bottleneck where only 1,280 breeding individuals sustained the whole population. This could have lasted for nearly 117,000 years and nearly brought our species to extinction. This bottleneck is also a great explanation for the substantial gap in the available human fossils during the time in Africa and Eurasia.

Combined with the wide range of tools Google has to offer, the tech giant has a sort of monopoly in the education sector, making it hard for companies like Microsoft and Apple to enter the market.
Compared to the M1-powered MacBook Air, which often sells for somewhere Rs 80,000, Chromebooks are available for as low as Rs 15,000. Even if Apple launches a pocket-friendly MacBook lineup, it might be hard for the company to sell them in India, where price is still a deciding factor when purchasing a device.
Apple also seems to be internally testing six different Macs, all based on the in-house developed M3 and M3 Pro chips. Rumour has it that we might see some of these upcoming devices sometime next year.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/laptops/apple-working-on-affordable-macbooks-8927239/,technology
Australia to launch lunar rover with NASA’s Artemis missions,The Australian Space Agency plans to launch a rover to the Moon with NASA's Artemis program as early as 2026.,"Only four nations have operated a rover on the Moon in history–the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and most recently, India. Japan is attempting to join that group with a launch on September 7 and now, the Australian Space Agency is working on a rover that will go to the moon as early as 2026 as part of the Artemis program.
“The Australian Space Agency, in partnership with NASA, is working with Australia’s space industry to design and build an Australian-made rover. It’s part of the Trailblazer program under the Moon to Mars initiative,” said a statement from the Australian government’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources released on Tuesday. The rover will be designed to collect samples of lunar regolith, or lunar soil, and NASA will try to extract oxygen from the sample.

Google Lookout ‘Image Q&A’ uses AI to offer detailed image descriptions to visually impaired,Google Lookout 'Image Q&A' feature uses an advanced visual language model developed by Google DeepMind to generate 'more detailed image descriptions'.,"Google Lookout, an Android app designed to help blind people and those with low vision is getting some new features. Launched in 2019, the app helps them accomplish everyday tasks like putting away groceries or sorting their mail.
In a blog post, the tech giant said Lookout’s ‘Image Q&A’ feature lets people with vision problems scroll through images on their camera app, social media or group chats. The company says it is using an advanced visual language model developed by Google DeepMind to generate ‘more detailed image descriptions.’
Users can also upload an image and get information about it even if there are no captions or alt text. After Lookout provides a description of what’s on the screen, they can ask follow-up questions about the photo by either typing or using voice.

Image Q&A is currently available in the UK, US and Canada in English. (Image Source: Google)
For the uninitiated, ‘Alt text’ describes what the image is about and can be used by screen readers to help visually impaired people understand what they are looking at. But the problem is that images shared on messaging apps or social media have low-quality captions and alt text, with the majority of them not having any ‘Alt text’ at all. This makes most photos inaccessible to people with visual impairment.

Currently, the Image Q&A feature is available to those in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada in English, but Google says it will soon be available globally. Lookout is also adding support for 11 new languages like Korean, Japanese and Chinese, bringing the total count to 34.
In the last few years, Google has made numerous announcements to improve digital accessibility. While the company’s Project Relate helps those with speech impairments communicate with others, Live Transcribe provides realme speech-to-text to text transcriptions for those who have problems hearing.
Apple has also come up with several useful features like ‘People Detection’, which lets blind people or those with low vision know how close the other person is to them.

UPI ATM can be the safest way to withdraw cash: Here’s to how use it,Hitachi Payment Services in collaboration with NPCI recently launched India’s first UPI ATM.,"India’s first UPI ATM is here. The latest development comes after Hitachi Payment Services, a subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd, in Japan, announced the launch of Hitachi Money Spot UPI ATM. The UPI ATM has been unveiled as a White Label ATM (WLA) in collaboration with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
The UPI ATM offers cardless cash withdrawals which eliminates the need for carrying physical debit or credit cards. The ATM allows users to obtain cash from multiple accounts using the UPI app. It is to be noted that WLAs are operated by non-banking entities. The new ATM will not only drive inclusivity but is also seen as a boon in areas where traditional banking infrastructure and penetration of cards is limited.

Besides, the UPI ATM is seen as a positive measure towards preventing issues such as card skimming, a type of financial fraud where devices are installed at ATMs or point-of-sales terminals to gather card information such as PIN and card number to siphon off cash.

How does it work?
In a video demo shared by fintech influencer Ravisutanjani Kumar, the UPI ATM can be seen as a touch panel with the words – ‘Welcome to UPI ATM’ in the centre and ÚPI Cardless Cash’ at the bottom right.
Tapping on the UPI Cardless Cash opens another window with options for cash amounts such as Rs 100, Rs 500, Rs 1000, Rs 2000, Rs 5000, and a button for other amounts. Once a user selects the desired amount, the screen displays a QR code and says “Scan using any UPI App. Once the UPI app (BHIM, GPAY, etc) is opened users need to scan the code.
After the code is scanned, users will be prompted to select their desired bank account and click on Confirm. The next window will show ‘Confirm to withdraw cash’ and users will need to click on Proceed. Later they will have to add their UPI PIN and once done, a confirmation message will be sent. Users will be able to see on the screen ‘We are processing your transaction’. Within a few seconds, the UPI ATM dispenses the selected amount.

How is it different?
Currently, the card-less mode of cash withdrawals is dependent on mobile numbers and OTPs. With UPI-ATM the transaction is carried out using QR codes that can be scanned using UPI applications installed on Android or iOS devices.

OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro review: Let some class weigh in,"The first aspect you will notice about the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro is its weight. At close to 2 kg, this is by far the heaviest computer accessory I have used.","There is something about mechanical keyboards that makes them both nostalgic and functional. Let me tell you I am old enough to have learnt typing on a Remington typewriter, long before computers and keyboards became a thing in India. And those spaced-out keys of the old typewriter, packing a kick every time you hit a key, is exactly what I am reminded of whenever I test a mechanical keyboard. And this feeling just went to another level with the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro.
When the review unit came in via courier, I thought they had sent me the wrong package. The box was so heavy that my son struggled to bring it up from the lobby. It was only when I unwrapped it that I was convinced that this was indeed the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro.

"China to launch new $40 bln state fund to boost chip industry, sources say","It is likely to be the biggest of three funds launched by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, also known as the Big Fund.","China is set to launch a new state-backed investment fund that aims to raise about $40 billion for its semiconductor sector, two people familiar with the matter said, as the country ramps up efforts to catch up with the U.S. and other rivals.
It is likely to be the biggest of three funds launched by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, also known as the Big Fund.
Its target of 300 billion yuan ($41 billion) outdoes similar funds in 2014 and 2019, which according to government reports, raised 138.7 billion yuan and 200 billion yuan respectively.
ADVERTISEMENT
One main area of investment will be equipment for chip manufacturing, said one of the two people and a third person familiar with the matter.
President Xi Jinping has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors. That need has become all the more pressing after Washington imposed a series of export control measures over the last couple of years, citing fears that Beijing could use advanced chips to boost its military capabilities.
In October, the U.S. rolled out a sweeping sanctions package that cut China’s access to advanced chipmaking equipment and U.S. allies Japan and the Netherlands have taken similar steps.
The new fund was approved by Chinese authorities in recent months, two of the people said.
ADVERTISEMENT
China’s finance ministry is planning to contribute 60 billion yuan, said one person. Other contributors could not be immediately learned.All the sources declined to be identified as the discussions were confidential.
The State Council Information Office, which handles media queries on behalf of the government, the finance ministry and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The Big Fund also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
INVESTMENTS TO DATE
The fundraising process will likely take months and it was not immediately clear when the third fund will be launched or if further changes will be made to the plan, said the first two sources.
ADVERTISEMENT
Backers of the Big Fund’s previous two funds include the finance ministry and deep-pocketed state-owned entities such as China Development Bank Capital, China National Tobacco Corporation and China Telecom.
Over the years, the Big Fund has provided financing to China’s two biggest chip foundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and Hua Hong Semiconductor , as well as to Yangtze Memory Technologies, a maker of flash memory and a number of smaller companies and funds.
Despite those investments, China’s chip industry has struggled to play a leading role in the global supply chain, especially for advanced chips.
INVESTMENT MANAGERS
The Big Fund is considering hiring at least two institutions to invest the new fund’s capital, said the three people.
ADVERTISEMENT
Several senior officials and former officials at SINO-IC Capital, the sole manager for the Big Fund’s first two funds, have been under investigation by China’s anti-graft authority since 2021.
Even so, SINO-IC Capital is expected to remain one of the managers for the third fund, said two of the people.
SINO-IC Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chinese officials have also reached out to China Aerospace Investment, the investment arm of state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, to discuss being one of the managers, said two of the people.

Meta to drop ‘Facebook News’ tab in some European countries,"""Facebook News"", which curates a feed of news articles, is a dedicated tab in the bookmarks section of the Facebook app.","Meta Platforms said on Tuesday it will discontinue the “Facebook News” feature on its social media app in the UK, France and Germany, later this year.
Users will still be able to view links to news articles and European news publishers will continue to have access to their Facebook accounts and pages after the change is implemented in December, Meta said.
However, Facebook will not form new commercial deals for news content on “Facebook News”, nor offer product innovations for news publishers in these countries.

“Facebook News”, which curates a feed of news articles, is a dedicated tab in the bookmarks section of the Facebook app.
“News makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed, so news discovery is a small part of the Facebook experience for the vast majority of people,” Meta said in a blog post.
Along with Big Tech peer Alphabet, the company has come under increasing pressure from lawmakers around the world to share a higher percentage of its advertising revenue with news publishers.
Meta has started blocking news on its Facebook and Instagram platforms for all users in Canada in response to a new law requiring internet giants to pay news publishers.

Apple inks new long-term deal with Arm for chip technology,"Apple uses Arm's technology in the processes of designing its own custom chips for its iPhones, iPads and Macs.","Apple has signed a new deal with Arm for chip technology that “extends beyond 2040,” according to Arm’s initial public offering documents filed on Tuesday.
Arm unveiled pricing on Tuesday for what it hopes will be a $52 billion initial public offering, which would be the largest such deal in the U.S. this year. Arm owner SoftBank Group plans to offer 95.5 million American depository shares of the United Kingdom-based company for $47 to $51 apiece, Arm said in a filing.
Arm owns the intellectual property behind the computing architecture for most of the world’s smartphones, which it licenses to Apple and many others. Apple uses Arm’s technology in the processes of designing its own custom chips for its iPhones, iPads and Macs.

The two companies have a long history – Apple was one of the initial companies that partnered to found the firm in 1990, before the release of its “Newton” handheld computer in 1993, which used an Arm-based processor chip. The Newton flopped, but Arm went on to become dominant in mobile phone chips because of its low power consumption, which helps batteries last longer.
Apple was among a number of large technology companies that on Tuesday invested $735 million in Arm’s initial public offering. Reuters last week was the first to confirm that Apple was among the strategic investors who agreed to buy shares.
The deal disclosed on Tuesday was not mentioned in Arm’s previous IPO filing documents made public on Aug. 21, implying that the deal was signed between then and Sept. 5.Arm declined to comment beyond its filings, and Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-inks-new-long-term-deal-with-arm-for-chip-technology-8926671/,technology

"What is Google Workspace and how do Duet AI, Smart Canvas & Spaces enhance it?","Google Workspace is not your ordinary office suite. Discover how its features Duet AI, Smart Canvas, and Spaces can enhance your workflow and collaboration.","Google has a long history of releasing innovative products with a seemingly promising future only to backtrack on those months or years later. But some services stand on truly solid ground. One of these is Google Workspace. Incentivised by the work-from-home trend during the pandemic, Google increased its focus on G Suite, its catalogue of office and productivity apps that also includes the likes of Gmail, and rebadged it to Google Workspace in October 2020. Since then, Workspace has become a feather in Google’s cap and is one of its most popular products ever (even though it’s still unprofitable).
Following the rebrand, Google also added new features to Workspace to enhance its functionality and appeal. One of these is Duet AI, which uses generative AI to help users create and summarise text, generate images from prompts, and organise data. Another is Smart Canvas, which integrates various Workspace apps and allows users to work more efficiently and creatively. And then there’s Spaces, which is a new way of communicating and sharing information within Workspace.

"India set to be the world’s largest adopter of AR & VR technologies, says founder of AjnaLens",AjnaLens aims to contribute to the Made in India initiative and the technological growth of the country by developing world-class products and nurturing local vendors and developers.,"Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are among the fastest evolving technologies in the world owing to the many use cases they present. India, which has the world’s youngest population, is on the threshold of exploring the boundless possibilities of these experiential technologies.  
“The current generation, mostly those in their 20s and 30s, are showing a strong enthusiasm for cutting-edge technologies. It is remarkable that youth in India eagerly wanted to embrace this technology, driven by their genuine interest and passion for these innovative advancements,” Pankaj Raut, founder of AjnaLens, told indianexpress.com.
AjnaLens, a pioneering Extended Reality (XR) startup based in Mumbai, recently launched two immersive reality headsets AjnaXR Pro and AjnaXR SE. The devices launched on August 15 claim to seamlessly merge the virtual and real worlds. These headsets are based on the company’s operating system – Ajna Chakra – which is based on Android. The AjnaXR Pro is priced at Rs 1,15, 499 and the AjnaXR SE comes at Rs 84,999.

Talking about the challenges faced by the company, Raut said that back in 2014 they were not aware of the magnitude of the risks owing to the lack of a supportive ecosystem within the country. However, over the years, the industry witnessed tremendous changes. “I can now say with pride that the industry has undergone a remarkable transformation. During our initial phases, we had to source components from various places, but today, because of the increased availability, procurement has become much smoother,” added Raut. 
The journey
Raut, who studied mechatronics engineering in the UK, says that he is immensely interested in human consciousness and the impact of technology on different aspects of life. In 2014, Raut met his co-founders at an MIT Media Labs event held at IIT Bombay. Following the meeting, the founders decided to work on holographic computers.
After its inception, AjnaLens began working with the Indian defence sector offering solutions for training and simulations of battlefield scenarios. The company also worked with industrial training institutes to assist students with skills such as welding and spray painting with the help of AI and mixed reality devices.

Ever since its launch, AjnaLens has made some significant strides. The company got the opportunity to showcase its devices at the CES Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas and also won the CES Innovation Award in 2023. The company has designed AR headsets for the Indian Army as well. “ We have successfully positioned ourselves to compete with major players in the market, surpassing them by offering a significantly superior product. We were also able to break the mindset that Indians couldn’t make world-class products,” Raut said.

During the initial days of its journey, the company was able to reduce the cost of simulators to one-third of the cost. As a result, the company bagged the Graham Bell Innovation Award. It also got recognition from Qualcomm among the top five hardware startups.
Made-in-India devices
AjnaLens is a made-in-India brand. When asked about how the company is fostering the Made in India vision, Raut said that technological growth was happening at an unprecedented pace in India. He believes that the growth is not just limited to large corporations, but small and medium-sized enterprises are seeing similar adoption, making it imperative to harness the make-in-India wave.
According to Raut, with affordable access to 4G and 5G smartphones and the internet, SMEs are becoming globally aware. “As aspirational Indians, we strive for the best in every domain, which includes contributing to vendor development. For instance, companies that once specialised only in basic optics are now evolving into experts in complex optics creation. This transformation has been facilitated by open-minded founders and owners who are interested in exploring next-generation technologies. This not only boosts innovation but also generates both direct and indirect employment,” said Raut.

XR for education
Both AR and VR can be a great tool for education. Raut illustrated how learning the piano can be an expensive affair, and how VR can come in handy to save both time and cost. These technologies are dynamic and not only help save time and cost but also offer ample flexibility to learners.

Opposites don’t actually attract finds new scientific study,"A new study has found that the old adage ""opposites attract"" hardly works when it comes to opposite sex couples.","Opposites attract. But a new study suggests that is only true in the case of magnetic poles and not in the case of humans. The new study confirms what individual studies have indicated for decades, rubbishing the old adage that “opposites attract.”

"World’s mangroves, marshes & coral could be devastated with 2 degree warming: Study","A new study has found that important coastal ecosystem hotspots like mangroves, coastal marshes and coral reefs can be devastated by just two degrees Celsius of global warming.","You could walk from Russia to America, from Australia to Tasmania about 17,000 years ago when sea levels were about 120 metres lower than they are today. But since the last Ice Age ended, oceans began rising by more than one metre a century. A similar rise in sea levels could happen due to human-caused global warming today, devastating coastal agriculture around the world.
In a study published in the journal Nature on Friday, researchers looked at how coastal habitats like mangroves, marshes and coral reefs retreated and adapted at the end of the last Ice Age and how they could cope with predicted sea level rises in this century.

Comet Nishimura could become visible this week: How to watch,Comet Nishimura could be visible this week with the unaided eye but it might be difficult to spot because it is so close to the Sun from our perspective.,"Comets are quite unpredictable celestial objects but NASA says it “seems like a good bet” that Comet Nishimura could become visible to the naked eye this week. Its orbit could bring it on a close approach to Earth on September 12, when it could be as close as 125 million kilometres away.
The comet was discovered in mid-August by amateur astronaut Hideo Nishimura, who used 30-second exposures with a standard digital camera to see it. Since then, the comet, officially called C/2023 P1 Nishimura, has increased in brightness as it went forward on its path in the inner solar system. The comet is angularly near the Sun so even if it is visible, you will only be able to spot it early before sunrise or late before sunset.

"Malaysia mulls rules for Google, Meta to pay news outlets for content","Malaysia is in discussions with Google, Meta and other major online platforms over the regulatory framework, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)","Malaysia said on Tuesday it is considering regulations that will make internet giants Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook parent Meta Platforms compensate news outlets for content sourced from them.
Malaysia is in discussions with Google, Meta and other major online platforms over the regulatory framework, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) said in a statement after meeting with officials from both companies.
The proposed regulations will be similar to rules in Australia, which in 2021 made it compulsory for Google and Meta to compensate media outlets for content that generates clicks and advertising dollars, the MCMC said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The MCMC is also mulling rules similar to Canada’s Bill C-11, which aims to regulate streaming platforms and requires them to support Canadian content.
It said the rules were part of government efforts to address “imbalances” in income for digital platforms and local media, and to ensure “fair compensation for news content creators.”
The MCMC said it was also in discussions with the social media platforms to address online harm such as child sex abuse material, online gambling and financial scams.
Malaysia has increased scrutiny of online content under Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who came to power in November.

Earlier this year, Malaysia said it would take legal action against Meta for failing to act against harmful content on its Facebook platform, but later dropped the plan following meetings with the company.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/malaysia-mulls-rules-for-google-meta-to-pay-news-outlets-for-content-8925195/,technology

Teardown of Huawei’s new phone shows China’s chip breakthrough,"Huawei started selling its Mate 60 Pro phone last week. The specifications provided advertised its ability to make satellite calls, but offered no information on the power of the chipset inside.","Huawei Technologies and China’s top chipmaker SMIC have built an advanced 7-nanometer processor to power its latest smartphone, according to a teardown report by analysis firm TechInsights.
Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro is powered by a new Kirin 9000s chip that was made in China by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), TechInsights said in the report shared with Reuters on Monday.
Huawei started selling its Mate 60 Pro phone last week. The specifications provided advertised its ability to make satellite calls, but offered no information on the power of the chipset inside.
ADVERTISEMENT
The processor is the first to utilize SMIC’s most advanced 7nm technology and suggests the Chinese government is making some headway in attempts to build a domestic chip ecosystem, the research firm said.
The firm’s findings were first reported by Bloomberg News.Huawei and SMIC did not immediately reply to Reuters’ request for comment.
Buyers of the phone in China have been posting tear-down videos and sharing speed tests on social media that suggest the Mate 60 Pro is capable of download speeds exceeding those of top line 5G phones.
The phone’s launch sent Chinese social media users and state media into a frenzy, with some noting it coincided with a visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.
ADVERTISEMENT
From 2019, the U.S. has restricted Huawei’s access to chipmaking tools essential for producing the most advanced handset models, with the company only able to launch limited batches of 5G models using stockpiled chips.
But research firms told Reuters in July that they believed Huawei was planning a return to the 5G smartphone industry by the end of this year, using its own advances in semiconductor design tools along with chipmaking from SMIC.
Dan Hutcheson, an analyst with TechInsights, told Reuters the development comes as a “slap in the face” to the U.S.
“Raimondo comes seeking to cool things down, and this chip is ‘look what we can do, we don’t need you,'” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/teardown-of-huawei-mate-60-pro-shows-chinas-chip-breakthrough-8924980/,technology

Microsoft’s Crop and Lock feature lets you create mini versions of Windows apps,The Crop and Lock feature can be used to create static live thumbnails or crop apps and interact with them in a mini window.,"Microsoft has added a new functionality called ‘Crop and Lock’ to its free-to-use PowerToys utility suite that lets users crop an app window to show the information they want to see or create an interactive thumbnail.
The recently introduced feature offers two modes – ‘Thumbnail’ and ‘Reparent’. While the former lets you select an area of the original window and create a non-interactive thumbnail, ‘Reparent’ lets you select a part of a window and control it from the thumbnail itself. All cropped apps will always stay on top of other windows, enabling users to access them without having to switch to that app.
How to enable and use the Crop and Lock feature?
To use ‘Crop and Lock’, download and install PowerToys 0.73.0 from the Microsoft website or GitHub and open it on your Windows-powered machine. Under the ‘Crop and Lock’ section, find and click on ‘Enable Crop and Lock’.
ADVERTISEMENT
Once enabled, focus on the window you want to crop and press the Thumbnail shortcut (Windows key+ Ctrl+ Shift+ T) or the Reparent shortcut (Windows key+Ctrl+Shift+R) and you will now be able to select the area you want to crop.
Now, a new window will appear allowing you to see a static or interactive view depending on which option you chose. If the default shortcuts are too complex for you, Microsoft allows you to customise them from the PowerToys app.

Microsoft notes that Thumbnail mode is compatible with most apps but you might encounter some issues with the Reparent mode, especially if you want to crop maximized or full-screen applications. Also, some UWP apps like Windows Calculator and apps with tabs or sub-windows like Notepad currently don’t play well with ‘Reparent’ mode.

"How to record voice calls on iPhone, Android smartphones","Call recording on most Android smartphones is fairly straightforward, where, one can initiate the same via the default dialer.","Voice call recording has been a staple feature on Android phones for over a decade. However, back in May 2022, Google banned a lot of third-party call-recording apps to enhance user privacy. On the other hand, iOS doesn’t support native voice call recording, however, there are a few workarounds to achieve the same.
Here are some of the easiest and best ways to record voice calls on Android and iOS-powered smartphones.
How to record calls on Android smartphones
Call recording on most Android smartphones is fairly straightforward, where, one can initiate the same via the default dialer, which will be the Google dialer in many cases. Similarly, device manufacturers like Samsung, Xiaomi, and Oppo also offer a first-party phone app, which when enabled can automatically record voice calls.

Do note that recording a voice call via a Google dialer will make an announcement to inform the other party that the call is being recorded. Similarly, dialer apps from OEM and third parties can start call recording without warning the other user. While it does breach the user’s privacy, most prefer this method of voice call recording.
Also, keep in mind that enabling VoWiFi will not allow users to record calls, especially on Samsung smartphones. Just make sure to disable the same to record calls via the Samsung phone app.
There are also plenty of third-party apps that enable call recording on Android devices. One such app is Truecaller, just make sure that the Truecaller is set as the default dialer app on your phone to enjoy voice call recording.

How to record calls on iPhones
Unlike Android, Apple does not support native call recording on iOS devices and one has to achieve the same using a third-party app.
ADVERTISEMENT
One of the easier ways to record voice calls on iPhones without the help of a third-party app is via the Voice Memo app. When you receive a call on your iPhone, receive the same and put the call on loudspeaker at the maximum volume, now, open the Voice Memo app and start recording the call.
While this is an intuitive way to record voice calls on iOS devices, it does involve a lot of steps and for each phone call, one has to intimate and terminate the call recording manually.
Similarly, one can also make use of apps like TapACall Pro or Call Recorder Lite to record voice calls. Even with these apps, one has to manually activate call recording each time.
Truecaller also offers a special way of call recording, where the call line is redirected through a special line and merges that call with the standard call to start call recording on iPhones.

While there are definitely ways to record calls on iPhones, if this is something that’s a must-have feature, then going with an Android phone makes a lot of sense.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/how-to-record-voice-calls-on-iphone-android-smartphones-8924047/,technology

"Watch this space: The Moon, the Sun and getting parcels from space","In his weekly column, Sethu Pradeep writes about ISRO’s Aditya L1, the European Space Agency’s helping hand and NASA’s ambitious asteroid sample mission.","Just weeks after touching the Moon with Chandrayaan-3, ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) shot for the Sun with the successful launch of the Aditya L1 mission. While Aditya will not exactly be “touching the Sun” in the same way as Chandrayaan-3 did with the Moon, it is an important milestone for Indian space science.
Interestingly, there is already a spacecraft that can claimed to have touched the Sun, or gotten as close as any probe ever has—NASA’s Parker Solar Probe. The NASA spacecraft came as close as 8.5 million kilometres away from the Sun in October 2018. To put that into context, the previous record holder for getting closest—Helios 2—went about 43 million kilometres away from the star in 2018.

Scrutiny of iris-scanning crypto project Worldcoin grows,Worldcoin has drawn criticism from privacy campaigners over its data collection.,"Increasing numbers of governments around the world are scrutinising Worldcoin, a crypto project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that was launched in July.
Almost 2.3 million people globally have signed up to have their irises scanned by Worldcoin’s “orb” devices in exchange for a digital ID and free cryptocurrency.
Altman says its ID will allow users to, among other things, prove online that they are human, notably in a future world dominated by artificial intelligence.
ADVERTISEMENT
Worldcoin has drawn criticism from privacy campaigners over its data collection. It has said the biometric data is either deleted or stored in encrypted form, and that it is “committed” to working with regulators.
Here’s the latest on action taken by governments:
ARGENTINA
In Argentina, where Worldcoin says interest in the project is strong, the Agencia de Acceso a Informacion Publica (AAIP) data regulator said last month it was investigating Worldcoin over its collection, storage and use of personal data.
In a letter dated Aug. 7, the AAIP asked Worldcoin for information about the project, including mitigation of risks and the “legal basis for the processing of personal data.”
BRITAIN
Britain’s data regulator said in July that it would examine Worldcoin.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We note the launch of Worldcoin in the UK and will be making further enquiries,” the Information Commissioner’s Office said.
FRANCE
France’s data watchdog CNIL carried out “checks” at Worldcoin’s Paris office this week, a spokesperson said on Aug. 31.
CNIL had previously said it was aware of the Worldcoin project and that the legality of its biometric data collection “seems questionable”.
GERMANY
A German data watchdog has been investigating Worldcoin since late last year due to concerns over its large-scale processing of sensitive biometric data, it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Financial regulator Bafin is also investigating the digital currency, according to German business daily Handelsblatt.
KENYA
In August Kenya suspended Worldcoin’s local activities while the government assesses potential risks to public safety.
A preliminary review had raised concerns, including that obtaining consumer consent in return for a monetary award bordered on inducement, the Communications Authority of Kenya and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner said.
PORTUGAL
Portugal’s data regulator, the CNPD, has inspected Worldcoin’s local data collection operation and been in contact with the Bavarian data protection authority in Germany, a spokesperson said.

Of course, it’s not like the data is being sold out to advertisers, but those who take privacy seriously would still want none of that. Especially since researchers recently discovered that chatbots can be tricked into revealing data they learned during training, so giving it personal information becomes even riskier.

"‘For people in Bengaluru, technology begins and ends with a smartphone app’","In an interview with indianexpress.com, angel investor Nagaraja Prakasam talks about his debut book, his journey, and his goal of empowering social enterprises.","Nagaraja Prakasam is a bearded man with a book in his hand. He wears a colourful handloom shirt and an overcoat with his name embossed on it — Naga. It is a walking advertisement for one of the social enterprises he has invested in, GoCoop — a marketplace for handlooms and crafts from India. A serial entrepreneur, he calls himself Naga the Farmer.
Nagaraja is a hands-on investor, identifying startups which others ignore or which seem to be a long bet. For example, Uniphore, which later became a unicorn, was rejected by quite a few investors before Nagaraja picked it up. Today, it is one of the largest global AI-native companies.
Nagaraja is now an author as his book Back to Bharat: In Search of a Sustainable Future has hit the shelves. He speaks to indianexpress.com about his debut book, his journey, and his goal of empowering social enterprises.
ADVERTISEMENT
Venkatesh Kannaiah: Your book Back to Bharat: In Search of a Sustainable Future is now on the stands. What was your inspiration for the book and what does it deal with?
Nagaraja Prakasam: My inspiration for the book began with a visit to Kappad in Kerala, at the place where Vasco da Gama landed in India. I was triggered by the immensity of the change brought about by the event and I began a journey to rediscover India. Since I was a technologist, I started searching for sustainable solutions for local problems, and since I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of India’s problems. I travelled across the country to meet with Indian social entrepreneurs and the solutions they had come up with.
The book recounts my journey across India, meeting with various village-level entrepreneurs and the way they looked and searched for solutions, implementing it with sustainable methods and using technology in a sustainable manner.
I have travelled to 28 states/UTs in India, visited remote regions, by trains, buses and have been on foot to meet rural innovators across the country. I have spent time with them, understanding their problem statements and the challenges they face.

Realme Buds Air 5 Pro review: Built-in tweeters drive these glossy TWS earbuds,"You won’t believe how good these earbuds sound for their price. They have dual drivers, noise cancellation, LDAC, and more.","Smartphones may have sort of reached a plateau of innovation, but TWS earbuds are still climbing the mountain of improvement. Every year, they deliver better sound quality, battery life, and features, making it harder to justify spending a fortune on premium models. The latest example of this trend is the Realme Buds Air 5 Pro earbuds, which offer an amazing audio experience at a budget-friendly price. I kept my expectations under check given their price, but after trying them out, I was pleasantly surprised. Here’s what impressed me the most.
Design and fit
They were so shiny that I could use them as a mirror to check my hair. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/The Indian Express)
The first thing that struck me when I unboxed the earbuds was the colour of the case. It’s supposed to be Astral Black, but actually looks more like a dark grey with a shiny finish — so shiny, in fact, that it doubles up as a fun mirror to check my hair on. I guess that’s a plus, but it also made both case and earbuds prone to fingerprints and scratches. The black colour didn’t help either. The only thing that ruined the sleek look was the clear section on top that had the Realme logo. It looked cheap and out of place and I’d have preferred the logo slapped across the front – anywhere but this.

ISRO successfully places Aditya L1 in orbit an hour after challenging launch,"From the orbit around the Earth, the Aditya L1 spacecraft will slowly be raised by the ISRO team through a series of manoeuvres till it slingshots towards the Sun.","As the Chandrayaan-3 lander and rover continue to collect data on the Moon, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Saturday successfully launched the observatory that will study the Sun from 1.5 million kilometres away. It took nearly 63 minutes for one of the heaviest configurations of the PSLV to place the spacecraft in a precise elliptical orbit of nearly 235 km x 19,500 km.
This was the first time the fourth stage of the PSLV was fired two separate times to take the primary payload of the mission to the precise place for orbit insertion. During the firings of the fourth stage of PSLV and the coasting phase in between, there were two instances — one for nearly 25 minutes and another for just over two minutes — when there were no eyes on the satellite. It was only after a ship-based station and then Kourou ground station acquired the data that the flight path could be seen.

Google DeepMind co-founder calls for US to enforce AI standards,The US has expanded restriction of exports of sophisticated Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices artificial-intelligence chips beyond China to other regions including some countries in the Middle East.,"The US should allow Nvidia’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips only to buyers who agree to ethically use the technology, Google DeepMind’s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman told the Financial Times on Friday.
The US should enforce minimum global standards for the use of AI, and companies should at a minimum agree to abide by the same pledge made by leading AI firms to the White House, Suleyman said.
In July, AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta Platforms made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer.

Decay of heaviest oxygen isotope casts shadow on physicists’ understanding of nuclear stability,"Both 28O and 27O were found to be generated when thick liquid hydrogen was bombarded with intense beams of 29F (flourine-29 isotope), having unstable nuclei, from a particle accelerator at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope (RI) Beam Factory, Japan.","Heaviest oxygen isotope was observed to quickly decay and challenge physicists’ understanding of nuclear forces, scientists report in a study published in the journal Nature.
Isotopes are elements sharing the same atomic number but differing in their atomic weights.
Atomic number is equal to protons in the atom’s nucleus, whereas atomic weight comes from the protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons and bound by strong nuclear forces, in the nucleus.
ADVERTISEMENT
The most commonly available form of oxygen, 16O, has 8 protons (atomic number 8) and 8 neutrons in its nucleus and thus, has an atomic weight of 16.
Its isotopes, oxygen-28 and oxygen-27, have the same protons (8), but differ in the number of neutrons, which is 20 and 19, respectively.
The neutron-rich isotopes, oxygen-28 (28O) and oxygen-27 (27O), were observed as they were in the process of decaying into oxygen-24 (8 protons, 16 neutrons), after emitting 4 and 3 neutrons, respectively, and thus, proving to be neutron-unbound, the international team of researchers led by Yosuke Kondo, assistant professor at the Department of Physics at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, said in their study.

The nucleus 28O was of significant interest as it was expected to be one of the few ‘doubly magic’ nuclei in the standard shell-model picture of nuclear structure, they said.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the nuclear shell-model, a shell inside a nucleus filled up with just the right number or ‘magic number’ of nucleons results in strong binding forces. These numbers are thought to include 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126 particles.
The most abundant form of oxygen, having 8 protons and 8 neutrons, is considered ‘doubly magic’.
However, the decay of 28O, with 8 protons and 20 neutrons and initially thought of as ‘doubly magic’, has challenged scientists’ understanding of principles governing nuclear forces.
Both 28O and 27O were found to be generated when thick liquid hydrogen was bombarded with intense beams of 29F (flourine-29 isotope), having unstable nuclei, from a particle accelerator at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope (RI) Beam Factory, Japan. The incident beam knocked out a proton from the liquid hydrogen’s nucleus, thereby generating 28O.
ADVERTISEMENT
The researchers observed these isotopes and studied their properties by directly detecting their decay products.
Further, they found that the existence of these isotopes was very short-lived, as they decayed through spontaneous neutron emission.
The present findings enhance our understanding of nuclear structure (and forces) by offering new insights, especially for extremely neutron-rich nuclei, the researchers said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/heavy-oxygen-isotope-decay-8919537/,technology

The science behind 100x zoom: Why periscope cameras are a big leap in mobile photography,Here’s why periscope lenses are better than telephoto lenses.,"Smartphone cameras have come a long way from the days when they had only one lens. Back then, you had to make do with whatever your single lens could capture, whether it was a wide shot or a close-up. But roughly since 2016, multi-camera phones have become the norm, and zoom lenses have opened up new possibilities for photography. Now, you can get closer to your subjects without losing image quality.
However, not all zoom lenses are created equal. The early ones were telephoto lenses that could only go up to 3x zoom. That’s nothing compared to the 100x zoom that some of the latest smartphones flaunt. How did they achieve this feat? The answer is periscope lenses. In this article, we will explore what periscope lenses are, why they are superior, and how you can get your hands on one.

James Webb Space Telescope reveals new details of iconic star explosion remnants,"The James Webb Space Telescope captured this beautiful image of an iconic supernova that has been studied for decades, revealing never-before-seen details.","The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said Thursday that the James Webb Space Telescope has begun observations of the famous Supernova 1987A. Observations by the telescope’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) could give important clues about how such exploded stars develop over time.
The image reveals what looks like a cosmic jellyfish with a central structure like a keyhole. This centre is packed with clumpy gas and dust ejected by the explosion of the star. This dust is so dense that Webb’s vision can’t penetrate even in near-infrared, leaving the dark hole in the image.

US curbs AI chip exports from Nvidia and AMD to some Middle East countries,U.S. officials usually impose export controls for national security reasons.,"The U.S. expanded the restriction of exports of sophisticated Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices artificial-intelligence chips beyond China to other regions including some countries in the Middle East.
Nvidia said in a regulatory filing this week that the curbs, which affect its A100 and H100 chips designed to speed up machine-learning tasks, would not have an “immediate material impact” on its results.
Rival AMD also received an informed letter with similar restrictions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding that the move has no material impact on its revenue.

U.S. officials usually impose export controls for national security reasons. A similar move announced last year signaled an escalation of the U.S. crackdown on China’s technological capabilities, but it was not immediately clear what risks were posed by exports to the Middle East.
In a separate statement, Nvidia said the new licensing requirement “doesn’t affect a meaningful portion of our revenue. We are working with the U.S. government to address this matter.”

The U.S. Commerce Department, which normally administers new licensing requirements on exports, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Last September AMD said it had received new license requirements that would halt exports of its MI250 artificial-intelligence chips to China.
ADVERTISEMENT
Nvidia, AMD and Intel have since then all disclosed plans to create less powerful AI chips that can be exported to the Chinese market.
Nvidia, which gave no reason for the new restrictions in the filing dated Aug. 28, last year said U.S. officials informed them the rule “will address the risk that products may be used in, or diverted to, a ‘military end use’ or ‘military end user’ in China.”
Nvidia this week did not specify which countries in the Middle East were affected. The company derived most of its $13.5 billion in sales in its fiscal quarter ended July 30 from the United States, China and Taiwan. About 13.9% of sales came from all other countries combined, and Nvidia does not provide a revenue breakout from the Middle East.
“During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG (U.S. government) informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East,” Nvidia said in the Aug. 28 filing.

Last year’s announcements came as tensions bubbled over the fate of Taiwan, where chips for Nvidia and almost every other major chip firm are manufactured.

In October 2022, the Biden administration went a step further when it published a sweeping set of export controls, including a measure to cut off China from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment. The move vastly expanded Washington’s reach in its bid to slow Beijing’s technological and military advances.
Japan and the Netherlands followed up with similar rules earlier this year.
Without American AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD, Chinese organizations will be unable to cost-effectively carry out the kind of advanced computing used for image and speech recognition, among many other tasks.

Apple starts testing 3D printers to make smartwatch casings,The production technique would render obsolete the need to cut parts of metal into the product's shape.,"Apple is testing 3D printers to make the steel frames of some of its upcoming smartwatches, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta’s Canada news ban fails to dent Facebook usage,"The company ended news sharing in Canada on its services at the beginning of August, while Google has said it plans to block news from search results in Canada once the law comes into effect.","Meta’s decision to block news links in Canada this month has had almost no impact on Canadians’ usage of Facebook, data from independent tracking firms indicated on Tuesday, as the company faces scorching criticism from the Canadian government over the move.
Daily active users of Facebook and time spent on the app in Canada have stayed roughly unchanged since parent company Meta started blocking news there at the start of August, according to data shared by Similarweb, a digital analytics company that tracks traffic on websites and apps, at Reuters’ request.
Another analytics firm, Data.ai, likewise told Reuters that its data was not showing any meaningful change to usage of the platform in Canada in August.
ADVERTISEMENT
The estimates, while early, appear to support Meta’s contention that news holds little value for the company as it remains locked in a tense standoff in Canada over a new law requiring internet giants to pay publishers for the news articles shared on their platforms.
Meta declined to comment on the estimates.

The Online News Act, passed by the Canadian parliament in June, forces platforms like Meta and Google parent Alphabet to negotiate commercial deals with Canadian news publishers for use of their content. Both Meta and Alphabet’s Google have said the law is unworkable for their businesses. Meta, in particular, has said links to news articles make up less than 3% of the content on its Facebook feeds and have no economic value to the company. The world’s biggest social media company has been trying to reduce the prevalence of news and other civic content on its platforms in recent years as it faces regulatory pressure in key markets around the world. Instead, it aims to promote lighter subjects like fashion, entertainment and sports.
The shift has resulted in a dramatic reduction in news consumption via social media, according to recent reports by the Reuters Institute and Pew Research Center.
Even before Meta pulled the plug on news links in Canada, Facebook referrals to a sampling of popular news sites in Canada were already down about 35% year-over-year in July and about 74% since 2020, according to Similarweb.
ADVERTISEMENT
Still, the company’s own transparency reports suggest news remains some of the most popular content on Facebook when it is there, at least in the United States, the only country for which Meta discloses the most frequently viewed content.
According to its most recent report, news websites made up 13 of the top 20 domains viewed on Facebook in the United States in the first quarter, while 18 of the top 20 individual links were to news articles.
Meta’s other big social platform Instagram is less of a presence in the news environment as it does not enable links within individual user posts.

Canadian government officials have accused Meta of brinkmanship in wiping its platforms of news in a moment of heightened need in Canada as wildfires force thousands of people from their homes, even as quiet negotiations over those rules continue behind the scenes.
Specific rules addressing how the law will be implemented are due to be released by late December, after which point the platforms would be expected to finalize deals with publishers.
Canada’s new Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge has spoken to both Facebook and Google since taking office after a cabinet shuffle at the end of July, her office told Reuters.

‘AI will help people think smarter and faster:’ Microsoft president Brad Smith,Microsoft’s president Brad Smith calls for human oversight and regulation of AI in an interview.,"“It is a tool that can help people think smarter and faster. The biggest mistake people could make is to think that this is a tool that will enable people to stop thinking.” This is how Microsoft’s president and vice-chairman Brad Smith described artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that has revolutionized various domains, from work to education, with its potential to enhance productivity and learning.
However, this powerful technology also poses significant threats. Echoing the concerns of other tech leaders, Smith urged for human oversight and regulation of AI in an exclusive interview with CNBC. He warned that AI can be weaponised and exploited for malicious purposes.

Tesla’s Autopilot faces unprecedented scrutiny,The U.S. auto safety regulator investigating Tesla's Autopilot is demanding an explanation for a software change that allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for longer.,"Elon Musk has championed Tesla Inc’s driver assistance Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” software as innovations that will both improve road safety and position the electric vehicle maker as a technology leader.
But the Tesla systems – and Musk’s claims about them – face their biggest challenge since the launch of Autopilot in 2015 as a series of lawsuits over fatal Tesla accidents head to court starting next month and a federal probe into Autopilot nears an end.
Here is a list of legal and regulatory challenges to Autopilot:
NHTSA INVESTIGATION
ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. auto safety regulator investigating Tesla’s Autopilot is demanding an explanation for a software change that allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for longer, risking collisions, documents released on Tuesday showed.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been probing the performance and safety of Autopilot after identifying more than a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles hit stationary emergency vehicles. It is investigating whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention when using the driver assistance system.
In June 2022, NHTSA upgraded an earlier probe of 830,000 Tesla vehicles into an engineering analysis – a required step before it could potentially demand a recall.
The agency’s acting head Ann Carlson told Reuters Aug. 25 that a resolution of the Autopilot investigation will come soon.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION
ADVERTISEMENT
Tesla is under criminal investigation in the United States over claims that the company’s electric vehicles can drive themselves, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters last year.
The Justice Department investigation potentially could conclude with criminal charges against the company or individual executives, the people familiar with the inquiry said.
In July, Tesla said in a securities filing that “the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features.”CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATIONLast year, California’s transportation regulator accused Tesla of “deceptive practice” of advertising suggesting its driver assistance technology provided autonomous vehicle control.
California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) could suspend Tesla’s license to sell vehicles in California and require the company to make restitution to drivers.
ADVERTISEMENT
California’s DMV is also conducting a separate safety review which could force Tesla to seek regulatory permits to operate its vehicles in California.
FIRST LAWSUIT OVER AUTOPILOT FATALITY
Tesla faces two trials over fatal Autopilot accidents in quick succession, with more to follow.
The first, scheduled for mid-September in a California state court, is a civil lawsuit containing allegations that the Autopilot system caused owner Micah Lee’s Model 3 to suddenly veer off a highway east of Los Angeles at 65 mph (105 kph), strike a palm tree and burst into flames, all in the span of seconds, in 2019.
FLORIDA LAWSUIT
The second trial, set to go to trial in October, arose out of an accident that killed the 50-year-old Tesla Model 3 owner Jeremy Banner when his car struck a tractor trailer at the intersection of a highway in Florida in 2019.
MOUNTAIN VIEW ACCIDENT
ADVERTISEMENT
A 2018 crash involving a Tesla Model X killed the driver, Apple engineer Walter Huang, when it swerved and slammed into a concrete divider on a freeway in Mountain View, California. A lawsuit by his wife against Tesla is scheduled to go to trial next year.
The National Transportation Safety Board investigated both the California and Florida accidents and blamed both the driver and Tesla. The NTSB said drivers relied too heavily on the Autopilot system, while Tesla failed to restrict the use of Autopilot or to adequately monitor driver attentiveness.
Tesla said the drivers’ hands in both accidents were not detected on the wheel for several seconds prior to the collision, and that they did not take action to avoid the accident.
CLASS ACTION
In September, Tesla was sued in a proposed class action accusing the EV maker and Musk of having deceptively advertised Autopilot and FSD as fully functioning or “just around the corner.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco said Tesla did this to “generate excitement” about its vehicles, drive up its stock price and become a “dominant player” in EVs.
Tesla did not respond to questions from Reuters about the lawsuits and investigations mentioned above.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/teslas-autopilot-faces-unprecedented-scrutiny-8915654/,technology

British officials say AI chatbots could carry cyber risks,Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said that experts had not yet got to grips with the potential security problems tied to algorithms that can generate human-sounding interactions.,"British officials are warning organisations about integrating artificial intelligence-driven chatbots into their businesses, saying that research has increasingly shown that they can be tricked into performing harmful tasks.
In a pair of blog posts due to be published Wednesday, Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said that experts had not yet got to grips with the potential security problems tied to algorithms that can generate human-sounding interactions – dubbed large language models, or LLMs.
The AI-powered tools are seeing early use as chatbots that some envision displacing not just internet searches but also customer service work and sales calls.
ADVERTISEMENT
The NCSC said that could carry risks, particularly if such models were plugged into other elements organisation’s business processes. Academics and researchers have repeatedly found ways to subvert chatbots by feeding them rogue commands or fool them into circumventing their own built-in guardrails.
For example, an AI-powered chatbot deployed by a bank might be tricked into making an unauthorized transaction if a hacker structured their query just right.
“Organisations building services that use LLMs need to be careful, in the same way they would be if they were using a product or code library that was in beta,” the NCSC said in one its blog posts, referring to experimental software releases.
“They might not let that product be involved in making transactions on the customer’s behalf, and hopefully wouldn’t fully trust it. Similar caution should apply to LLMs.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Authorities across the world are grappling with the rise of LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which businesses are incorporating into a wide range of services, including sales and customer care. The security implications of AI are also still coming into focus, with authorities in the U.S. and Canada saying they have seen hackers embrace the technology.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/british-officials-say-ai-chatbots-could-carry-cyber-risks-8915628/,technology

Disney gambles on free cricket to turn the tables in India streaming war,The company will stream live matches of the Asia Cup from Aug. 30 as well as the World Cup in October-November that users of 600 million smartphones in the cricket-mad nation can watch without paying anything.,"Walt Disney is attempting to revive the fortunes of its streaming business in India by offering free cricket on smartphones, betting that the strategy will boost advertising revenue and offset the impact of a subscriber exodus.
The India streaming operations, which were Disney’s biggest last year globally by users, posted a loss of $41.5 million on revenue of $390 million for the year to March 2022, its last disclosed results.
With subscriber exits accelerating and slashing the user base by a third between October last year and July, the Burbank-headquartered entertainment giant’s financial performance in the country is only expected to come under more pressure.
ADVERTISEMENT
Disney’s woes are a cautionary tale about the Indian market where expectations about a swelling middle-class are often frustrated by deeply cost-conscious consumers.

The company acquired Indian streaming service Hotstar when it paid $71 billion for some 21st Century Fox global assets in 2019. With the streaming rights of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world’s richest cricket league, in the bag, Disney made cricket on Hotstar a paid service in 2020 and was confident about garnering up to 100 million users within years.
But Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani snatched IPL rights away in a $2.9 billion bid last year, and then streamed games for free. Soon, Disney subscribers fled – out of 61 million users in October, roughly 21 million had left by July.
Disney internally recognises it misjudged Indians’ willingness to pay – people signed up for Hotstar when it had IPL, but didn’t stick around to buy more premium plans to watch other content, two Disney sources told Reuters.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We were bullish on Indian subscribers’ propensity to pay. That’s not worked out,” said one of the sources. “Free cricket is the only bullet left.”
The company will stream live matches of the Asia Cup from Aug. 30 as well as the World Cup in October-November that users of 600 million smartphones in the cricket-mad nation can watch without paying anything.
The new strategy comes as Disney is also exploring options of finding a joint venture partner or even a sale of its India business.

‘HYBRID MODEL’
Disney renewed its rights to show the International Cricket Council’s tournaments in India from 2024 to 2027 by paying around $3 billion. It retains digital streaming rights but last year licensed the TV broadcast rights to Indian’s Zee Entertainment for around $1.5 billion, a source said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The company has assessed that going back to the free-cricket model on mobile phones and tablets is the strategic pivot needed to shore up revenues. It calls the move a new “hybrid model” to drive advertising revenues by raising smartphone viewers, while targeting new subscribers for the Hotstar TV app where cricket will remain under paid plans.
This strategy is about “how we build a model which will allow us to drive two revenue streams more meaningfully,” Sajith Sivanandan, head of Disney+ Hotstar, said in an interview, adding Disney was confident its user base will grow in the years ahead.
Making cricket free on mobile will help “450 million-plus customers to tune in” over 48 days of the 50-over World Cup that is being hosted by India, compared to 300 million in the last World Cup in 2019, stated a “Festival of Cricket 2023” Disney presentation created for advertisers and seen by Reuters.
The company is eyeing a new record of 50 million concurrent viewership during the World Cup, double the 2019 number, the document added. That will also be 56% higher than what Ambani’s JioCinema clocked during this year’s IPL finals in May.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sivanandan said the company would target advertisers with budgets as low as 200,000 rupees ($2,421). Another new initiative would be interactive ads connecting watchers to a brand’s WhatsApp chat to enable purchases of the products.
The Disney document showed a new deal struck with Coca-Cola for boosting subscriptions. QR codes on an estimated 400 million Coke bottles will offer a Hotstar trial, with Disney hoping 80,000 people will then take paid plans.

LOW AVERAGE REVENUE
There is no guarantee, though, that Disney’s strategy pivot will succeed.
Daoud Jackson, a senior analyst specialising in streaming businesses at UK research firm Omdia, said free cricket was not a sure shot winner as companies pay billions of dollars to get streaming rights but commensurate advertising revenue takes many years to materialise.
ADVERTISEMENT
While India’s middle class is massive, the broad user base in the world’s most populous country “narrows sharply” when it comes to paying users, VC firm Blume Ventures said in April.
In the United States, ad-free Disney+ streaming service subscription rates are set to rise by 27% to $13.99 per month. By contrast in India, Disney+ Hotstar service costs $3.62 a month.
The average revenue per user (ARPU) is very low in India at just $0.59, compared to Disney+ U.S. service’s $7.31, according to Disney’s latest quarterly earnings report.
Disney’s global leadership has put pressure on India to speed up the “path to profitability” for Hotstar. CEO Bob Iger’s Chief of Staff, Nancy Lee, visited the country earlier this year and questioned the business leaders if streaming operations can be profitable before the end-2024 global target, sources said.
ADVERTISEMENT
She was told advancing of the target will not be possible.
Still, research firm Media Partners Asia estimated last year India’s streaming market will be worth $7 billion by 2027, where Netflix and Amazon.com’s Prime Video will also be competing. But it is the rivalry with JioCinema, run by Ambani’s broadcast unit Viacom18, that could be the most intense.
As Ambani promoted IPL on his streaming apps around March, he focused on how people can watch matches on the go on smartphones, and do not need a TV. To counter that, Disney at the time rolled out ads saying cricket was best watched on TV – for which it still has IPL rights.
In new ad campaigns last week, Disney changed tack.
“Now watch all matches of the world’s biggest tournaments, anywhere, on your mobile, absolutely free,” it said.

New Zealand plans digital services tax for multinationals from 2025,"The proposed digital services tax will target multinational businesses that earn income from New Zealand users of social media platforms, search engines, and online marketplaces.","New Zealand said on Tuesday it would introduce legislation for a digital services tax on large multinational companies from 2025 after talks for a global rollout did not reach consensus at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
More than 140 countries were supposed to start implementing next year a 2021 deal overhauling decades-old rules on how governments tax multinationals that are widely considered to be outdated as digital giants like Apple or Amazon can book profits in low-tax countries.
But the proposal was pushed back last month after countries with digital services taxes, with the exception of Canada, agreed to hold off applying them for at least another year.

“While we will keep working to support a multilateral agreement, we are not prepared to simply wait around until then to find out,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in a statement.

The tax would be payable by businesses that make over 750 million euros ($812 million) a year from global digital services and over NZ$3.5 million a year from digital services provided to New Zealand users. It is expected to generate NZ$222 million over four years.

The tax would be applied at 3% on gross taxable New Zealand digital services revenue, a similar rate adopted by comparable countries like France and the United Kingdom.

OpenAI releasing version of ChatGPT for large businesses,"ChatGPT Enterprise offers more security, privacy and higher-speed access to OpenAI's technology.","Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI said on Monday it is releasing a version of ChatGPT targeted to large businesses, increasing the overlap in what OpenAI and its financial backer Microsoft offer to customers.
ChatGPT Enterprise offers more security, privacy and higher-speed access to OpenAI’s technology, the company said. Early customers include Block, Carlyle and Estee Lauder Companies.
When OpenAI released the consumer-focused ChatGPT in November, it set off frenzied use of generative AI in daily tasks from writing to coding, and reached 100 million monthly active users in January.
ADVERTISEMENT
Many people in the U.S. have used ChatGPT to help with work-related tasks, even though their employers discourage it, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.
With the launch of ChatGPT Enterprise, OpenAI hopes employers will feel comfortable embracing ChatGPT usage at work.
Microsoft already offers businesses access to ChatGPT via its Azure OpenAI Service, though in order to use it businesses must be a customer of Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform.
ChatGPT Enterprise subscribers need not subscribe to Azure, OpenAI said. OpenAI and Microsoft have introduced overlapping services before, and it is unclear how much the two companies are competing over customers.
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked whether ChatGPT Enterprise competes with Microsoft over customers, an OpenAI spokesperson said that “customers can choose which platform is right for their business.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/openai-releasing-version-of-chatgpt-for-large-businesses-8913998/,technology
Intel says new ‘Sierra Forest’ chip to more than double power efficiency,"Intel said its ""Sierra Forest"" chip will have 240% better performance per watt than its current generation of data center chip, the first time the company has disclosed such figures.","Intel on Monday said a new data center chip coming out next year will handle more than double the amount of computing work that can be done for each watt of power used, part of a broader industry push to lower electricity consumption.
At a semiconductor technology conference held at Stanford University in Silicon Valley, Intel said its “Sierra Forest” chip will have 240% better performance per watt than its current generation of data center chip, the first time the company has disclosed such figures.
The data centers that power the internet and online services consume huge amounts of electricity, and technology firms are increasingly facing pressure to hold steady or reduce the amount of energy they use. That has pushed chip companies to focus on how to get more computing work done per chip.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ampere Computing, a startup founded by ex-Intel executives, was first to market with a chip focused on handling cloud computing work efficiently. Intel and rival Advanced Micro Devices have followed suit by announcing similar products, with AMD’s offering hitting the market in June.
Intel, which has lost market share to AMD and Ampere in data centers, said on Monday its “Sierra Forest” chip is on track to arrive next year.
The company is for the first time splitting its data center chips into two categories: A “Granite Rapids” chip that will focus on performance but consume more power, and the more efficient “Sierra Forest” chip.
Ronak Singhal, a senior fellow at Intel, said the company’s customers can consolidate older software onto a smaller number of computers inside a data center.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I may have things that are four or five, six years old. I can get power savings by moving something that’s currently on five, 10 or 15 different servers into a single” new chip, Singhal said. “That density drives their total cost of ownership. The higher the density, the fewer systems they need.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/intel-says-new-sierra-forest-chip-to-more-than-double-power-efficiency-8913989/,technology
US judge set to decertify Google Play class action,Consumers claimed they would have paid less for apps and enjoyed expanded choice but for Google's alleged monopoly.,"A U.S. judge plans to free Google from having to defend against a class action by 21 million consumers who claimed it violated federal antitrust law by overcharging them in its Google Play app store.
Monday’s decision by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco could significantly reduce damages that Google, a unit of Alphabet, might owe over the distribution of Android mobile applications.
Consumers claimed they would have paid less for apps and enjoyed expanded choice but for Google’s alleged monopoly. Google has denied wrongdoing.
ADVERTISEMENT
Donato said his Nov. 2022 class certification order should be thrown out because his decision, also announced Monday, not to let an economist testify as an expert witness for the consumers eliminated an “essential element” of their argument for certification.
The judge said he couldn’t decertify the class immediately because Google had been appealing his November order. He directed lawyers for Google and the consumers to try resolving that issue before a Sept. 7 hearing.
The class action included consumers from 12 U.S. states and five territories, who were not part of a similar case against Google brought by various state attorneys general.
Class actions let plaintiffs sue as a group, and potentially obtain larger recoveries at lower cost than if they were forced to sue individually.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lawyers for the consumers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
The case is part of wide-ranging antitrust litigation that includes 38 states and the District of Columbia, and companies including Epic Games and Match Group.
The case is In re Google Play Store Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-md-02981.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/us-judge-set-to-decertify-google-play-class-action-8913978/,technology

"Vikram lander observes temperature variation on lunar surface, records high of 70 degree Celsius",The payload has a temperature probe equipped with a controlled penetration mechanism capable of reaching a depth of 10 cm beneath the surface.,"ISRO on Sunday released a graph of the temperature variation on the lunar surface and a senior scientist of the space agency expressed surprise over the high temperature recorded on the Moon.
The national space agency said Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) payload onboard Chandrayaan-3’s Vikram lander measured the temperature profile of the lunar topsoil around the pole to understand the thermal behaviour of the Moon’s surface.
“Here are the first observations from the ChaSTE payload onboard Vikram Lander. ChaSTE (Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment) measures the temperature profile of the lunar topsoil around the pole to understand the thermal behaviour of the moon’s surface,” ISRO said in an update on social media platform ‘X’.

Speaking about the graphic illustration, ISRO scientist B H M Darukesha told PTI: “We all believed that the temperature could be somewhere around 20 degree centigrade to 30 degree centigrade on the surface but it is 70 degree centigrade. This is surprisingly higher than what we had expected.” The space agency said the payload has a temperature probe equipped with a controlled penetration mechanism capable of reaching a depth of 10 centimetres beneath the surface.

“The probe is fitted with 10 individual temperature sensors. The presented graph illustrates the temperature variations of the lunar surface/near-surface at various depths, as recorded during the probe’s penetration. This is the first such profile for the lunar south pole. Detailed observations are underway,” ISRO said in a statement.
Scientist Darukesha explained, “When we go two to three centimetres inside the Earth, we hardly see two to three degree centigrade variation whereas there (in Moon), it is about 50 degree centigrade variation. This is something interesting.” The temperature dips to minus 10 degree Celsius below the lunar surface, the senior scientist said, adding that the variation is from 70 degree Celsius to minus 10 degree Celsius.
ISRO said the ChaSTE payload was developed by a team led by the Space Physics Laboratory (SPL) of the space agency’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in collaboration with Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad.
India on August 23 scripted history as ISRO’s ambitious third Moon mission Chandrayaan-3 touched down on the lunar surface, making it only the fourth country to accomplish the feat, and first to reach the uncharted south pole of Earth’s only natural satellite.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced that the spot where Chandrayaan-3 Vikram lander touched down would henceforth be called ‘Shiv Shakti Point’, and the site where the Chandrayaan-2 lander crash-landed on the Moon’s surface in 2019 would be known as ‘Tiranga Point’.

Under a thousand: Adding a real macro lens to your phone camera,Skyvik Signi X Mobile Camera 20X macro lens kit adds a real macro lens to your phone for not too much money.,"Mention macro cameras on smartphones, especially mid-segment ones, and we are sure that most people will simply shake their heads in disappointment. And with good reason. While many phones in the Rs 10,000 – Rs 45,000 price segment claim to come with dedicated macro sensors, these are often very token 2 or 5 megapixel affairs that boost spec sheets and sink photography. Macro or super close up photography for many of the users of such phones means taking a high resolution snap from the main camera and then cropping it to get a closer look at a subject.

An affordable macro lens with premium feels and accessories
The rather elaborately named Skyvik Signi X Mobile Camera 20X macro lens kit changes that. As its name indicates, it is a macro lens that adds 20x magnification to any phone camera. There have been such lenses in the past but they have tended to be difficult to use, compatible only with some phones and often very expensive (low priced options generally comes low image and product quality). The Signi X fortunately is a rather different kettle of macro fish.

Powered by the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2, the device runs on a stripped-down version of MIUI, which is more than enough for someone who wants to use the phone for basic tasks and a bit of browsing.
While the rear 50MP camera may not be the best in the price segment, the all-day battery makes up for it. If you are tight on budget and are looking for a 5G-enabled device that offers a lag-free experience, the Redmi 12 5G is an easy recommendation for Rs 11,999.

Smartvision 3
Developed by Raz Mobility, Smartvision 3 is designed especially for the visually impaired or those with low vision. While it may look like a feature phone, the device actually runs on Android and comes with a dedicated button to trigger Google Assistant.

Apart from the large T9 keypad, the phone also features physical keys that help you navigate the user interface by touching the device. Alternatively, the touchscreen-enabled device can also be explored using Google’s ‘TalkBack’ feature.  Some unique features include a banknote recogniser, colour detector, book reader, light detector, and magnifier.
Similar to Senior World Easyfone Elite, it also offers wireless charging. On the back, you get a 16MP shooter whereas the front of the phone packs a 5MP camera that is good enough to take selfies or video calls.
While this may sound like the perfect smartphone for the elderly, the cost and availability might deter you. It is not available in India and starts from $539 in the US, which roughly translates to Rs 44,500.

LG Tone Free Fit review: Great sounds for the gym,"For a small fitness-focused earbud, the Tone Free Fit sure has some very active noise cancellation… may be best in class for this price range.","At the height of the pandemic, one of the most innovative products was the LG Tone series truly wireless earbuds which came with UV technology that sanitised the units every time they went back into their charging cases. However, these superb-sounding earbuds were a bit expensive and somewhat serious in their looks. Now LG has released the Tone Free Fit series aimed at those who are very active and need the convenience of earbuds that fit into their fitness regime.
Unlike the stemmed design of the earlier models, the LG Tone Free Fit has a more compact design that fits completely in your ears with a rubber fin on top to keep it in place during your morning jog or late-night workout session. The earpieces can be easily twisted into the ears for a better fit. The earbuds come with a black and fluorescent yellow dual-colour design that gels with the innards of the charging case. The charging case however is not very compact; it seems to be a tad bit larger than what came with earlier models.
I have tried enough noise cancellation earphones over the years to be not awed by anything I hear — or don’t hear — anymore. However, the moment the LG Tone Free Fit went inside my ears I was indeed awed, as the drone of the Atomberg fan in my living room was sucked into a vacuum soon after. For a small fitness-focused earbud, the Tone Free Fit sure has some very active noise cancellation… may be best in class for this price range. And when going for my evening walks, where traffic is always a concern, the ambient mode works pretty well. In fact, I like the fact that the Tone Free app gives you two options here — a conversation mode and a listening mode for when you just need to be aware of your surroundings.

You can switch to the ambient mode using the touchpad settings on the earbuds too, but it will go to the setting you have selected on the app by default. The app lets you select preset equaliser modes like the immersive or 3D sound stage for movies and games. It also comes with the option to create your own custom presets. Using the app you can find the earbuds if they slipped inside the cavities of your sofa or been taken to the kitten’s lair.

Oliver Anthony’s vocals get all the focus when you listen to Rich Men North of Richmond, the guitar is balanced accompaniment to his political rant of a song that is becoming popular across the world. But as you switch to Zach Bryan’s Something in the Orange you get to know how rich these earbuds can be. The twang of the guitar chords reverberates beyond your ears, thumping your heart and soul. Also, you feel the soundstage better with a number like this, filling your ears with highs and lows… really rich. You get the sense that Tone Free has more of a neutral profile, with no excess bass or treble.
This is when I discovered Sid Sriram’s new English Album Sidharth. Sid is a singer I love for his versatility that blends his training in Carnatic music with the learnings of his American upbringing. Do the Dance is a number that highlights just this, with its very global sounds that sound Indian somewhere thanks to his soulful rendition. The Tone Free Fit managed to balance out the bassy music with Sid’s sharp vocals.

As Shekhar Ravjiani’s Fly Fly Away took me far away from sultry Noida during one late evening walk, the sweat drops trickling down my brow reminded me where I really was. But the Free Tone Fit with its IP67 rating can manage this well. I liked the fact that you can lock the touchpad of the earbuds using the app so that there are no false touches when you are working out.

A single charge should be able to last a full week with lots of hours of music and calls. In fact, for the weeklong review, I did not have to charge these more than once. And every time you open the charging case you will see the blue lights that are getting reading to give your earbuds the UV-Nano treatment.
At Rs 12,989, the LG Tone Free Fit is a good option for those looking to buy a truly wireless set to help with workouts and jogs. I am not sure this works well for professional users though, because it does look like something you will wear to the gym. If that’s not a problem, you can wear it for your Zoom calls too. At this price point, the Tone Free Fit offers best-in-class noise cancellation, a balanced sound profile and the convenience of an app that offers great customisations.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/lg-tone-free-fit-tws-review-8911450/,technology

"With Tesla push, India mulls import tax cut if EV makers build locally",The policy being considered could allow automakers to import fully-built EVs into India at a reduced tax as low as 15%.,"India is working on a new electric vehicle policy that would slash import taxes for automakers that commit to some local manufacturing, following a proposal by Tesla which is considering entering the domestic market, people with direct knowledge said.
The policy being considered could allow automakers to import fully-built EVs into India at a reduced tax as low as 15%, compared to the current 100% that applies to cars which cost above $40,000 and 70% for the rest, said two of the sources, including a senior Indian government official.
Tesla’s best-selling Model Y, for example, starts at $47,740 in the U.S. before tax credits.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There is an understanding with Tesla’s proposal and government is showing interest,” said the official, who is familiar with the issue.
India’s commerce ministry, which is working on the plan, and Tesla, did not respond to requests for comment.
Asked about the move, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters “there is no proposal in front of me” to reduce import duties on electric vehicles.
If such a policy is adopted, it could amount to a drastic reduction in the cost of imported EVs that local carmakers have been keen to avoid. It could also open the door for global automakers, beyond Tesla, to tap the world’s third-largest car market where sales of EVs are less than 2% of total car sales, but growing rapidly.
ADVERTISEMENT
The lower import taxes could help Tesla sell its full range of models in India, and not just the new car it wants to make locally, said a third source.
Shares of Tata Motors, India’s largest electric car manufacturer, fell nearly 3% on the Reuters report, while rival Mahindra and Mahindra dropped over 2%, dragging the benchmark auto index to an intra-day low with losses of 1.1%.
New Delhi is going to move slowly in considering the policy proposal as any lowering of taxes on imported EVs could disrupt the market and upset local players like Tata and Mahindra that are investing to build electric cars at home, the Indian official said.
“This is going to go through a lot of deliberations even though government is keen on getting Tesla. That’s because of the impact on domestic players,” said the official.
ADVERTISEMENT
The policy is still in the initial stages of deliberation and the final tax rate could change, two of the sources said.
TESLA’S NEW EV
Other countries have taken similar measures to spur EV manufacturing commitments. Indonesia, for example, has offered to reduce import duties from 50% to zero for EV makers planning investments, a move seen aimed at attracting Chinese players and Tesla.
Tesla first tried to enter India in 2021 by pushing officials to lower the 100% import tax for EVs. Last year, the talks between Tesla and the Indian government collapsed when officials conveyed the company would have to first commit to local manufacturing.
More recently, Tesla has told Indian officials it is keen to set up a local factory and make a new EV priced around $24,000, roughly 25% cheaper than its current entry model, for both the Indian market and export.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tesla’s senior public policy and business development executive Rohan Patel has in recent weeks met top officials privately. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held talks with CEO Elon Musk in June, has been tracking progress closely, Reuters has reported.
Indian officials conveyed there will be no special incentives for Tesla’s market entry, and the proposal for a low import tax, conditional on a manufacturing commitment, was touted by Tesla to keep both sides happy, the sources said.
One of the sources said Tesla told Indian officials a potential India factory could operate at full capacity by 2030.
Outside the United States, Tesla currently has a plant in Shanghai – its largest factory worldwide – and one outside Berlin. It is building a new plant in Mexico that will focus on a new mass-market EV platform Musk has said will slash costs for consumers.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/with-tesla-push-india-mulls-import-tax-cut-if-ev-makers-build-locally-8911352/,technology

How to use Google’s dark web report to secure your online identity,Did you know that Google can scan the dark web for your personal information and notify you if it finds any? Learn how to use this feature and protect yourself from identity theft.,"Google is a search engine that indexes the entire web to fetch you results and it’s now also using its powers to protect you from the dark web. After launching “dark web report” in the US back in March, the company has finally launched the feature in India as well. The feature scans the dark web for any presence of your personal information, and if any information is found online, it sends a notification with suggestions on the steps you can take.
The dark web is the internet’s seedier side and is not easy to access – you need special browsers to get in. Some people use it for legal and private reasons, but others use it for illegal and harmful activities. One of the things that happens a lot on the dark web is the sale of stolen information, and you might be a victim without even knowing it. That’s why Google’s feature can be very useful.
You can add different types of information to the feature for Google to scan or monitor, such as your email address, phone number, physical address, and date of birth. The feature is similar to another one that Google has, which alerts you if your personal information shows up in regular search results, but this one is for the darker side of the web.
ADVERTISEMENT
The feature is available for everyone, but if you are a Google One subscriber, you get more benefits. You can monitor more details and get real-time alerts, while non-subscribers only get a one-time scan.

New crew for the space station launches with 4 astronauts from 4 countries,"It was the first U.S. launch where every spacecraft seat was occupied by a different country — until now, NASA had always included two or three of its own on its SpaceX taxi flights.","Four astronauts from four countries rocketed toward the International Space Station on Saturday. They should reach the orbiting lab in their SpaceX capsule Sunday, replacing four astronauts living up there since March. A NASA astronaut was joined on the predawn liftoff from Kennedy Space Center by fliers from Denmark, Japan and Russia.
They clasped one another’s gloved hands upon reaching orbit. It was the first U.S. launch where every spacecraft seat was occupied by a different country — until now, NASA had always included two or three of its own on its SpaceX taxi flights. A fluke in timing led to the assignments, officials said.
“We’re a united team with a common mission,” NASA’s Jasmin Moghbeli radioed from orbit. Moghbeli, a Marine pilot serving as commander, said her crew’s makeup demonstrates “what we can do when we work together in harmony.” With her on the six-month mission are the European Space Agency’s Andreas Mogensen, Japan’s Satoshi Furukawa and Russia’s Konstantin Borisov.
ADVERTISEMENT
“To explore space, we need to do it together,” the European Space Agency’s director general, Josef Aschbacher, said minutes before liftoff. “Space is really global, and international cooperation is key.”The astronauts’ paths to space couldn’t be more different.
Also read | Elon Musk’s SpaceX sued by US Justice Department for hiring discrimination
Moghbeli’s parents fled Iran during the 1979 revolution. Born in Germany and raised on New York’s Long Island, she joined the Marines and flew attack helicopters in Afghanistan. The first-time space traveler hopes to show Iranian girls that they, too, can aim high. “Belief in yourself is something really powerful,” she said before the flight. Mogensen worked on oil rigs off the West African coast after getting an engineering degree.
He told people puzzled by his job choice that “in the future we would need drillers in space” like Bruce Willis’ character in the killer asteroid film “Armageddon.” He’s convinced the rig experience led to his selection as Denmark’s first astronaut. Furukawa spent a decade as a surgeon before making Japan’s astronaut cut. Like Mogensen, he’s visited the station before.
Borisov, a space rookie, turned to engineering after studying business. He runs a freediving school in Moscow and judges the sport, in which divers shun oxygen tanks and hold their breath underwater.

One of the perks of an international crew, they noted, is the food. Among the delicacies soaring: Persian herbed stew, Danish chocolate and Japanese mackerel. SpaceX’s first-stage booster returned to Cape Canaveral several minutes after liftoff, an extra treat for the thousands of spectators gathered in the early-morning darkness. Liftoff had been delayed a day for additional data reviews of the capsule’s life-support system.
Another NASA astronaut will launch to the station from Kazakhstan in mid-September under a barter agreement, along with two Russians. SpaceX has now launched eight crews for NASA. Boeing was hired at the same time nearly a decade ago, but has yet to fly astronauts.

Meta to include video live-streaming on next-gen Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses: Report,The reports also suggest that the device will come with enhanced cameras and viewers of the live-stream can also talk with the user.,"It’s a race of wearables, and Meta is leaving no stone unturned. After a report surfaced claiming that around 90 per cent of consumers abandoned the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, Meta seems to be bracing for a grand comeback. Unaffected by the existing model’s low user retention, Meta now has plans to let users livestream videos with viewers who can also interact with them.
A report by journalist Janko Roettgers, who is privy to internal documents, suggests that the latest iteration of Ray-Ban Stories will not only let users live-stream videos directly to Facebook and Instagram but will also allow viewers to talk back through the built-in headphones. While this may seem far-fetched, considering multiple viewers speaking at a time, Meta may have some unique ideas to execute this if true.

According to Roettgers, the new device will also feature improved battery life and enhanced cameras. The second-generation Ray-Ban Stories will also raise audio playback in case the surrounding sounds get too loud.

The first-generation Ray-Ban Stories were introduced in September 2021. Facebook had unveiled the device that was expected to be its first-ever product to offer a glimpse of its plans for a metaverse. The smart glass was a collaboration between Meta Platforms and Italian optical equipment designer EssilorLuxottica. The sunglasses allow users to take pictures, listen to music, and send and receive WhatsApp and Facebook messages. The device came at a price of $299, along with various style combinations.

Reportedly, out of 300,000 units sold between September 2021 and February 2023, only 27,000 were still being regularly used. This was reportedly also an outcome of several technical problems, including issues with voice commands, audio, inadequate battery life, and difficulty in importing media from other devices.

"Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic review: This watch can measure stress, and a lot more",The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic looks like Galaxy Watches have for the past few years. But the Classic version this year has the rotating bezel.,"Smartwatches are no longer a niche. In fact, you stand out these days by opting for an analogue watch with people staring at you as if you have hit the bad times. But even as more users across the world switch to smartwatches of all shapes and sizes and price points, the fact remains that the technology itself has not changed much over the past few years. All companies are now looking at improving the efficiency of their devices and perfecting the features they offer. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is also a milestone in such a journey.
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic review: What’s new
The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic looks like Galaxy Watches have for the past few years. But the Classic version this year has the rotating bezel, which though looks a bit archaic as a concept — I used to have a watch with one in school — but has been adapted so wonderfully well for the digital world. I felt the bezel is a very natural way to navigate a smartwatch, moving through screens and inside them, and easier to access than a crown. The way Samsung has used the bezel, giving it the ability to control almost everything on the watch is really innovative.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-classic-review-8908731/,technology

Midjourney introduces image inpainting feature: Here’s what it means,The new feature essentially allows users to select specific portions of an image and edit them via text prompts.,"When it comes to images and artworks, Artificial Intelligence is getting better with each passing day. With Midjourney, creators are finding newer ways to produce imaginative artworks. Now, the popular AI-powered image generator has added yet another interesting feature to its model. 
The new upgrade will let creators paint-by-prompt with its new feature, something which AI art creators have been eagerly looking forward to. This feature allows creators to edit upscaled images simply by editing the text prompt. Known as Vary Region, the feature lets users select and alter an area of an artwork with new words. This, according to experts, allows greater freedom for creators.

In simple words, the Vary Region feature lets users select specific sections of an image and modify them with the help of text prompts. Besides, the tool also endows the user with the ability to add elements like adding accessories to a portrait – this is what is known as inpainting.
ADVERTISEMENT
Midjourney states that the inpainting feature works ideally with large edits – 20 to 50 per cent of the image. However, it will struggle to change or replace small details in the background. With the latest update creators need not wait for the final render, they can prompt-paint to perfect their image.

It is to be noted that the inpainting feature works best when the prompt change is in sync with and complements the original image. Midjourney claimed that inpainting is not a magic fix. The feature creates new images based on the original image and a customised prompt.
Midjourney’s competitor Stable Diffusion, a free open-source image generator, already offers functions such as inpainting and outpainting. Reportedly, Stable Diffusion has an edge over Midjourney in terms of accuracy. Regardless, Midjourney’s new Vary Region feature is seen as a leap towards offering more refined, user-friendly solutions to creators. 
Midjourney is a generative AI image creation tool that comes with an annual subscription at $100. ",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/midjourney-introduces-image-inpainting-feature-heres-what-it-means-8907805/,technology

5 cool new WhatsApp features that will make your life easier,"From sending images in HD to voice chats for groups, here are some of the latest WhatsApp features you should give a try.","WhatsApp, one of the most popular instant messaging platforms in the world often rolls out new features. While some of these bring much-needed quality-of-life changes, many of them add new functionalities to the app. From sending photos in HD to Discord-like voice chats in groups, here are some of the latest WhatsApp features that can enhance your productivity and overall user experience.
Screen sharing on video calls
Earlier this month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the ability to share screen during a video call. Using the new feature, users can easily share their screen with others no matter what platform they are on. It is really handy if you want to show something on your screen but don’t want to resort to apps like Google Meet, Zoom, Discord or Skype.
To share your screen on WhatsApp, start a video call with a person or a group of people and tap on the ‘Share’ icon that appears at the bottom of the screen. Once you give the app permission to record your screen, it will be visible to all participants in the call.

Send high-quality photos
While WhatsApp may be the preferred platform for billions when it comes to texting, until recently, it did not let users share images in HD. This was really frustrating since users had to rely on third-party solutions to send photos.
But in a recent update, the instant messaging platform added the option to send images in HD and said it would soon introduce the option to send videos in HD as well.
To send images in HD, open a chat and choose the photo you want to share. On the photo-sharing screen, tap on the ‘HD’ button that appears on the top bar and you are good to go. One thing to note here is by default, WhatsApp sends compressed images, so you will have to tap on the button every time you want to send photos in HD.

Voice chats in groups
Similar to Discord’s voice chat and Twitter Spaces, WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature called ‘Voice chats’ for those who want to talk to others in a group.

While WhatsApp’s group call feature ringed everyone in the group, the new ‘Voice chats’ feature sends a silent notification. Unlike ‘group calls’, which require you to manually add members, the new feature lets you join or leave the call whenever you want.
It is useful if you don’t want to disturb others and want to have a conversation with group participants. Whenever someone initiates a ‘voice chat’, the group icon will automatically change to a waveform icon and show a ‘Connect’ button.

Edit sent media captions
Ever sent a media file on WhatsApp just to realise the caption was wrong or had typos? Instead of sending media captions separately or having to resend the media file, WhatsApp now lets you edit media captions. The functionality works just like the messaging app’s ‘Edit message’ feature which lets you edit messages up to 15 minutes after they are sent.
To edit media captions after they are sent, tap on the media message with caption and you will see an ‘Edit’ button similar to how it looks when editing text messages.

Create groups without names
Yesterday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a new quality of life for WhatsApp that lets users quickly create groups without having to name them. Instead of users having to manually name a group, WhatsApp will automatically name groups with up to 6 participants based on the people in the group.
The company also explained that in case someone who is not on your contact list joins the group, they will only be able to see your phone number. Also, names in the group will be extracted from your contact list.
Note: WhatsApp is still rolling out some of the aforementioned features, so it might take some time before they are available on your device.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/5-cool-new-whatsapp-features-that-will-make-your-life-easier-8907069/,technology
YouTube ditches angular corners for rounded ones in new design upgrade,"Although new design has been deployed, it is being rolled out in a phased manner.","Google is known to make frequent changes to its apps and services, mostly considering their aesthetic and utilitarian aspects. Latest in the new wave of change is the rounded corners in YouTube’s video player. In a bid to make the application visually appealing, YouTube has ditched its angular edges for curved ones.
With the latest update, the main video player now looks similar to the mini player and video suggestion on the left panel. Contrary to the sharp edges of the earlier version, the new rounded edge is expected to offer a softer look and a modern feel. The new look will not be applicable to the theatre mode. When a user maximises the video, it will likely fill out the entire screen.
The latest development has been confirmed by YouTube spokesperson Allison Toh to The Verge. Toh said that all users will see the rounded corners in videos on the desktop site. The new change will be visible in a phased manner at the account level. The update has already been rolled out and the new player is visible to many users.
ADVERTISEMENT
The new look is not all about visual appeal, as it has some visible drawbacks. Reportedly, YouTube is cutting down on pixels from the original content, in essence, the platform is showing cropped videos. Moreover, design experts feel that rounded corners may not go well with desktop monitors that come with squared-off corners. Several users took to Twitter to express their displeasure with the new change.

"‘India took a walk on the moon,’ says ISRO as rover rolls out of lander",India made history with a soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 near the south pole of the moon on Wednesday evening.,"“India took a walk on the moon!,” the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said on Thursday morning after the rover rolled out of the lander late Wednesday night, hours after India made history with a soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 near the south pole of the moon at 6.04 pm.
Nearly four hours later, the foldable ramp on one side of the lander opened up. And, the six-wheeled, 26 kg lander with two science payloads came out of it. “Chandrayaan-3 rover: Made in India, Made for the MOON!” ISRO said.
The 17-minute descent phase went exactly as planned, with the lander autonomously guiding itself – slowing down from 1,680 metres per second to almost 0 metres per second, selecting the exact spot, and landing slowly and steadily as the country watched with bated breath.
Follow live updates on the moon mission here!

The mission has already achieved its goals of soft landing and roving, with the science experiments now getting 14 days to operate. With the lander and rover completely being operated on energy from solar cells, they will stop functioning when the landing spot goes into the lunar night. The electronics on board are unlikely to survive as temperatures plummet to -130 degrees Celsius on the lunar surface.
ISRO Chairman S Somanath has said previously that the space agency will check the viability of the lander-rover after the night and see whether it can be revived.

India became the fourth country to land on the moon after the United States, Russia, and China. It became the first country to do so near the lunar South Pole after the Russian mission that was to land a couple of days before it crashed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the country from South Africa.
The Chandrayaan-3 payloads will further the science of the two predecessors by studying lunar quakes, mineral compositions, and the electrons and ions near the surface of the moon. The mission will attempt to study water ice, the presence of which was first confirmed by its predecessor.

There are two scientific experiments on the rover. The LASER Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) will determine the chemical and mineral composition of the lunar surface.

Meta’s new AI model can translate & transcribe nearly 100 languages,The company has publicly released SeamlessM4T under a research licence to allow researchers and developers to build on it.,"In a truly globalised world, language should not be a barrier. And this is what seems to have prompted tech giant Meta to come out with a unique AI model. Meta has created an AI model, SeamlessM4T, which can translate and transcribe up to 100 languages across text and speech. SeamlessM4T is the first all-in-one multilingual multimodal AI translation and transcription model.
With its latest model, Meta aims to take interconnectedness to another level, offering users access to more multilingual content. “Today, we’re introducing SeamlessM4T, the first all-in-one multimodal and multilingual AI translation model that allows people to communicate effortlessly through speech and text across different languages,” reads the post on Meta’s official website.

Meta has publicly released SeamlessM4T under a research licence to allow researchers and developers to build on it. The SeamlessM4T has speech recognition for nearly 100 languages and speech-to-text translation for nearly 100 input and output languages. It also supports speech-to-speech translation in around 100 input languages and around 35 output languages, including English.
ADVERTISEMENT
Built on a vast dataset
The company also said that it is releasing the metadata for SeamlessAlign, its biggest open multimodal translation dataset to date which has a total of 270K hours of mined speech and text alignments.
“Building a universal language translator, like the fictional Babel Fish in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, is challenging because existing speech-to-speech and speech-to-text systems only cover a small fraction of the world’s languages. But we believe the work we’re announcing today is a significant step forward in this journey,” read the post.

Meta claims that when compared to approaches using separate models, SeamlessM4T’s single system approach reduces errors and delays. It increases the efficiency and quality of the translation process. The company says that this facet would make it easy for people who speak different languages to communicate effectively.
What is SeamlessM4T built on?
Meta said that the new AI model is built on advancements that it and others made over the past few years in a bid to create a universal translator. In 2022, the company released its text-to-text machine translation model, No Language Left Behind (NLLB), which supports around 200 languages. NLLB has been integrated into Wikipedia ever since as one of its translation providers.

The company had also shown a demo of its Universal Speech Translator, which is also the first direct speech-to-speech translation model for Hokkien, a language that does not have a widely used writing system. In 2023, it revealed its Massively Multilingual Speech, a model that offers speech recognition, speech synthesis, and language identification for over 1,100 languages.
According to Meta, SeamlessM4T is based on the findings from all the above projects that allow it to offer multilingual and multimodal translation experience from a single model.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-seamlessm4t-ai-model-8907073/,technology
Sony to launch PlayStation Portal remote player for $199.99,Sony PlayStation Portal remote player lets you play PS5 games from the comfort of your bed or couch and connects to the console via Wi-Fi.,"Sony will be launching its portable gaming console dubbed ‘PlayStation Portal remote player’ by the end of the year. The upcoming device will enable gamers to stream PS5 games from the comfort of their couch or bed.
Featuring an 8-inch LCD screen with 1080p resolution, Sony says the PlayStation Portal can run games at up to 60 fps. Unlike recently launched standalone handheld gaming consoles like Steam Deck or ROG Ally, PlayStation Portal will remotely connect to your PS5 over Wi-Fi and lets you play games available on your console.
Similar to Nintendo Switch, the PlayStation Portal remote player features two controllers on both sides which look similar to the company’s DualSense controllers with support for adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. The handheld gaming device can also double up as a media player by mirroring the PS5 screen.

While it can connect to a Dual sense controller and features a 3.5mm headphone jack, PS VR 2 games that require the headset and titles from Sony’s upcoming PlayStation Plus Premium cloud streaming service will not be supported.

To stream games from your main console, Sony recommends an internet connection with a minimum speed of 5Mbps, whereas the recommended speed sits at 15Mbps. However, the streaming device does not support Bluetooth, so you won’t be able to connect a Bluetooth headset.
According to IGN, who got early access to the device, the handheld console seems to have no latency. Also, it looks like Sony is yet to finalise the battery size, so we don’t know how many hours the PlayStation Portal remote player will last on a single charge. But a recent report by CNET suggests the company plans to match the device battery with the Dualsense controller, meaning it might last anywhere between 7 to 9 hours.
Even though Sony hasn’t announced the PlayStation Portal remote player’s launch date, the company says it will be priced at $199.99, which roughly translates to Rs 16,500.

In May this year, Sony confirmed the existence of its handheld gaming console codenamed ‘Project Q’, which ran on a forked version of Android. The device was also leaked by a prominent tipster last month, who said it will have an easy-to-understand user interface.
After Valve unveiled the Steam Deck – its first-ever portable Windows-powered handheld gaming device, the niche has seen renewed interest with many eager to play PC titles on the go. Soon after, Asus jumped on the bandwagon with the ROG Ally, another AMD-powered handheld console that can easily run the latest AAA titles.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/sony-to-launch-playstation-portal-remote-player-for-199-99-8906966/,technology

WhatsApp users will soon be able to create groups without names: Zuckerberg,The new feature names groups of up to 6 participants based on their names.,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg today announced a new feature for WhatsApp that lets users create groups without a name. In a recent Facebook post, Zuckerberg said that the functionality can come in handy when you are in a hurry and don’t have time or the bandwidth to name a group.
Also, unnamed groups with up to 6 participants will now be dynamically named based on who is in the group. For example, if there are two participants in a group named ‘Matt’ and ‘Lupin’, WhatsApp will automatically label the conversation as ‘Matt and Lupin’.
WhatsApp explains that the feature also protects user privacy with the group name displayed differently for each participant, based on how they have named the person in their on-device contact. In case you are added to a group with people who don’t have your contact, they will only be able to see your phone number in the group.

The ability to make unnamed groups will be rolling out to everyone in the coming weeks, so you might have to wait a while.
In the last few weeks, WhatsApp developers have introduced a bunch of new features to the instant messaging platforms like the ability to send photos in HD, edit sent media captions and a new AI-powered sticker generation tool.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/whatsapp-users-will-soon-be-able-to-create-groups-without-names-zuckerberg-8906199/,technology
China’s Xiaomi wins state planner nod to make EVs amid glut in autos,"CEO Lei Jun, who has said Xiaomi's foray into EVs will be his last major entrepreneurial project, posted on Saturday pictures of people holding a banner saying 'Fighting for Xiaomi Auto"" on his personal Weibo social media account.","Xiaomi Corp has won the approval of China’s state planner to manufacture electric vehicles (EVs), said two people with knowledge of the matter, marking a major step towards the smartphone maker’s goal of producing cars by early next year.
The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which regulates new investments and production capacity in China’s auto industry, gave the nod for EV manufacturing to Beijing-based Xiaomi earlier this month, said the people. Xiaomi’s venture is only the fourth since end-2017 to win NDRC approval.
While NDRC’s nod brings Xiaomi closer to mass production of EVs more than two years after it first announced the plans, the venture still needs clearance from the Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT), which assesses new automakers and models for technical and safety requirements.

And it would be entering China’s car manufacturing sector at a time when the world’s largest auto market is wrestling with a series of issues, including a capacity glut and slowing demand that have stoked a bruising price war and hit supplier margins.

Xiaomi had pledged a $10 billion investment over a decade in the automobile business and set a goal of mass producing its first cars in the first half of 2024. But there were doubts if the timeline could be met as the NDRC has been cautious in approving new EV production plans of companies because of concerns on overcapacity and slowing demand in the sector.
Tesla Inc’s plan to expand its Shanghai plant had yet to win the nod to go ahead, Reuters reported in June. And industry sources have previously told Reuters U.S. luxury EV maker Lucid Group is keen to make cars in China but has been advised that the possibility was low.
Reuters was not immediately able to determine why NDRC granted approval to Xiaomi. Its EV plant has been marked by the Beijing municipal government as an important industrial upgrade project.

Xiaomi, which owns the world’s third largest smartphone brand by shipments, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NDRC and MIIT also did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. The sources declined to be named as the matter is private.
While it awaited the approvals, Xiaomi has forged ahead on the venture, completing construction of factory facilities capable of producing 200,000 EVs annually in Beijing, according to a report in state-run newspaper Beijing Daily in July.
Xiaomi plans to produce about 100,000 EVs next year, said one of the sources. It has also accelerated hiring workers for its EV plant since last week as it prepares a production ramp-up in December, two Xiaomi workers, who did not wish to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters.

CHALLENGING TIMES
The severity of the challenges facing Xiaomi is evident in the automobile factory utilisation rates in China.
ADVERTISEMENT
Chinese factories, including those making combustion engine cars, were capable of producing 43 million units annually at the end of 2022, but their utilisation rate was just 54.5%, down from 66.6% in 2017, China Passenger Car Association data showed.
But Xiaomi, which reported an 18.9% drop in its latest quarterly revenue in May, has its own compulsions for foraying into EVs.
It is making the shift to diversify away from its main smartphones business amid slumping demand for gadgets. China’s smartphone sales fell 4% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2023, reaching the lowest Q2 sales figure since 2014, according to consultancy Counterpoint.
Xiaomi plans to use the thousands of stores it has as showrooms for its electric cars, Reuters previously reported.

UK’s handling of Microsoft deal sows doubts over post-Brexit direction,EU antitrust regulators said in response they would now look at whether the new terms would affect the concessions they had already agreed with the U.S. company.,"The long-running battle between Microsoft and Britain over the Activision Blizzard deal took another twist on Tuesday, raising more questions than answers about the country’s approach to deals in the post-Brexit era.
Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been locked in a dispute with the U.S. software giant over its $69 billion bid to buy the “Call of Duty” maker since it opposed the takeover in April.
It had said in July, just minutes after the U.S. regulator failed in its own effort to stop the takeover in court, that it was willing to look again at the case when Microsoft returned with a “detailed and complex” proposal.
ADVERTISEMENT
On Tuesday it said it would stick to its original decision to block it.

But it will look at a separate restructured deal put forward by Microsoft, in which Activision would divest its cloud streaming rights to a third party – France’s Ubisoft Entertainment – excluding in the European Union.
The carve-out is designed to not upset a deal with Brussels for Microsoft to license content to rival cloud services.
EU antitrust regulators said in response they would now look at whether the new terms would affect the concessions they had already agreed with the U.S. company.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ronan Scanlan, a competition lawyer at Arthur Cox in Dublin, who previously worked for the CMA, said no one was well-served by the “uncertainty and confusion” in Britain.
“Some may say that the CMA has bent over backwards to accommodate Microsoft, others that this is the consequence of the CMA having over-reached in the first place,” he told Reuters.

TOUGH STANCE
The CMA had objected to the world’s biggest gaming deal over concerns it would hinder competition in the nascent cloud gaming sector, and said that a Microsoft offer to make Activision’s games available on rival leading cloud gaming platforms was not enough to remedy its concerns.
The decision underscored the tough new stance the CMA was taking against big technology after it became a standalone regulator following Britain’s departure from the European Union.
ADVERTISEMENT
Gustaf Duhs, a former CMA lawyer and competition lead at Stevens & Bolton, said the new proposal had moved beyond behavioural remedies, which the CMA had never liked, to something closer to a structural remedy.
“But it’s not a clean structural remedy because there’s still fundamentally a link between the activities of Microsoft and Ubisoft, and it’s limited rights that are being transferred,” he said.
The CMA could seek assurances on how Ubisoft would be able to use the rights, which would take the concession back into behavioural remedy territory, he added.
Scanlan said under the newly proposed deal the merged Microsoft-Activision would offer the gaming content to only one player, which will be allowed to commercialise the rights to other cloud gaming service providers.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the question must be asked if the time it has taken to get to this point has been well-spent for all parties involved. “Few, other than perhaps the CMA, would answer in the affirmative,” he said.
Antony O’Loughlin, head of litigation at law firm Setfords, agreed. “For Microsoft and other regulators, this likely represents an unnecessary step the company’s been forced to take by an overzealous UK regulator, which still hasn’t green-lighted the deal,” he said.
The fate of Microsoft’s deal in Britain has brought in to question whether the CMA has the power to kill a megadeal if it is not in tune with the United States, European Union and China.
The CMA’s block in April drew fury from the merging parties, with Microsoft saying that Britain was closed for business.
ADVERTISEMENT
It said on Tuesday that it had not felt any political pressure over its handling of the deal.

Tom Smith, a partner at law firm Geradin Partners and previously legal director at the CMA, said both sides would portray the outcome as a win, with the CMA securing concessions that no other agency had achieved.
The CMA will also avoid having to defend its original block in court, and Microsoft finally looks set to secure its deal.
“The process has been tortuous, and there’s still possibly scope for the wheels to come off, but we shouldn’t expect Big Tech deals to sail through nowadays,” Smith said.

The CMA will now review the new proposal, with a deadline for an announcement by Oct. 18. It could order a much longer inquiry if it finds it still has competition concerns.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/uks-handling-of-microsoft-deal-sows-doubts-over-post-brexit-direction-8906101/,technology
"Netflix signups remain high, fueled by password-sharing crackdown","Wall Street had raised concerns that password-sharing could mute subscriber growth. However, Netflix's crackdown managed to reinvigorate its user additions.","Signups for Netflix in the United States remain elevated despite a fall from June’s record high after the video-streaming pioneer’s crackdown on shared passwords came into effect in May, according to data from research firm Antenna.
“Love is sharing a password,” Netflix had posted on X – then known as Twitter – in 2017, but its global crackdown on password-sharing hinted at its strategy to open new revenue streams in a saturating, competitive market.
Attracting new subscribers and retaining old ones has become a tough task in the last few years as customers now have a surfeit of options – Walt Disney’s streaming service, Amazon.com’s Amazon Prime Video and Warner Bros Discovery’s Max, among others.
Netflix’s shares rose 1.7% in early trading.

Wall Street had raised concerns that password-sharing could mute subscriber growth. However, Netflix’s crackdown managed to reinvigorate its user additions.
The video-streaming company’s gross subscriber additions fell by 25.7% in July over the prior month, after signups more than doubled in June, Antenna said. But its 2.6 million gross additions in July were overall elevated when compared to the normal, it added.
Netflix had said last year it was going to limit account-sharing and was testing various approaches in some markets.
The company estimated that more than 100 million households had shared their log-in credentials with friends and family outside their homes. This has led analysts to expect that about 50 million users will ultimately create their own accounts.
ADVERTISEMENT
Around 23% of users who signed up in July chose the cheaper ad-supported Netflix plan – the highest since the plan was launched in November – an increase of 4 percentage points from a month earlier, Antenna said.
The research firm sources its streaming data from transaction records such as online purchase receipts and banking information.

The fine is valid as Meta is not respecting European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), said Hanne Inger Bjurstroem Jahren, a lawyer representing the regulator, Datatilsynet.
“There is no discussion on whether the company is in violation of these rules … Today Meta breaks GDPR rules,” she told the court, speaking on the last day of a two-day hearing.
Meta told the court on Tuesday it had already committed to ask for consent from users and that Datatilsynet used an “expedited process” that was unnecessary and did not give the company enough time to answer.
ADVERTISEMENT
The regulator has said that it was unclear when, and how, Meta would seek consent from users and that, in the meantime, users’ rights were being violated.
Datatilsynet could make the fine permanent by referring its decision to the European Data Protection Board, which has the power to do so, if it agrees with the Norwegian regulator’s decision.
That could also widen the decision’s territorial scope to the rest of Europe. Datatilsynet had yet to take this step.

Here’s what I think of it.

Or if it’s too small, there’s even the 51mm variant. You also get plenty of strap options to suit your style and mood.

AI will eliminate rote learning: Ei CEO Pranav Kothari,AI can be the ultimate solution to the problem of rote learning. Technologies like Mindspark have the potential to redefine both teaching and learning across India.,"“I don’t fear maths anymore. Now, I eagerly look forward to studying maths. It feels like playing a game,” said Shwetha, a Class 7 student from Telangana. Young Shwetha is among the thousands of school-going Indians who are using the GPT 4-backed adaptive learning software called Mindspark. 
For Pranav Kothari, CEO of Educational Initiatives (Ei), the mission is simple: to transform education in India from rote learning to meaningful learning. Ei began its journey in 1996 by establishing Eklavya, a school in Ahmedabad. Five years into its maiden venture, the company realised that students were not gaining a deep conceptual understanding, something that could make education a fulfilling and rewarding experience.

"Microsoft, Activision to sell streaming rights to secure biggest video gaming deal","After months of back-and-forth, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday it had stuck by its original decision to veto the deal, forcing Microsoft to come forward with new terms.","“Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard will sell its streaming rights to Ubisoft Entertainment in a fresh attempt to win approval from Britain’s anti-trust regulator for its $69 billion sale to Microsoft.
Microsoft had announced the biggest gaming deal in history in early 2022, but the acquisition was blocked by Britain’s competition regulator, which was concerned that the American computing giant would gain too much control of the nascent cloud gaming market.

Facebook owner Meta asks Norway court to halt privacy fine,"The company is asking for a temporary injunction against the order, which imposes a daily fine through to Nov. 3.","Meta Platforms on Tuesday asked a court in Norway to stop a fine that the country’s data regulator has imposed on the owner of Facebook and Instagram for breaching user privacy, in a case that could have wider European implications.
Since Aug. 14, Meta Platforms has been fined 1 million crowns ($94,313) per day for harvesting user data and using it to target advertising at them, called behavioural advertising, a practice common to Big Tech.
The company is asking for a temporary injunction against the order, which imposes a daily fine through to Nov. 3.

“Meta has already committed to ask for consent (from users),” Christian Reusch, a lawyer representing the company, told the court on Tuesday.
The Norwegian data regulator, Datatilsynet, told Meta on July 14 of its intention of fining the company unless Meta took remedial action. The regulator went ahead with the fine on Aug. 7.
On Aug. 1, Meta said it had agreed to ask for consent from users in Europe before allowing behavioural advertising, citing a January decision from its lead regulator, in Ireland, where the company is headquartered.
Reusch also told the court Datatilsynet used an “expedited process” that was unnecessary and did not give the company enough time to answer.

Datatilsynet will present its arguments on Wednesday.
The regulator has previously said it was unclear when and how Meta would seek consent from users and that, in the meantime, their rights were being violated.
“Datatilsynet will argue that there is no basis for an injunction,” Tobias Judin, the regulator’s head of international section, told Reuters.
Datatilsynet could make the fine permanent by referring its decision to the European Data Protection Board, which has the power to do so, if it agrees with the Norwegian regulator’s decision.

That could also widen the decision’s territorial scope to the rest of Europe. Datatilsynet has yet to take this step.

Microsoft announces Starfield and camo wraps for Xbox Series X,"Unlike skins from third party companies like D-brand which are essentially stickers, the official Xbox Series X wraps stick using velcro hooks and loops and can be removed anytime.","Microsoft announced three new wraps for the Xbox Series X that lets gamers customise their gaming console. One of the plastic wraps is inspired by the recently launched limited edition Starfield-themed Xbox controller and headset.
In case you don’t like the white-coloured wrap, the company is offering two camo colours to choose from – Arctic Camo and Mineral Camo. Microsoft says  the “wraps were designed specifically for Series X and have a custom, precision fit.” Moreover, the console performance won’t be affected since the wraps don’t cover vents and include small feet which ensures that air flows freely.

Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus review: Room-filling playback,The Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus looks like an elegant soundbar though it is heavier than most other products this size that I have handled over the years.,"I have always wondered why Sennheiser does not make more speakers and audio equipment. But the fact is that they do in fact have a range of soundbars that uses the Ambeo branding which suggests a 360-degree immersive sound experience. The Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus with subwoofer, like a lot of other products from the German brand, aims to catch the top bracket of soundbars in the market by claiming to have the best immersive sound you can buy. But does it live up to these claims?
The Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus looks like an elegant soundbar though it is heavier than most other products this size that I have handled over the years. But then, this 7.1.4 channel set up has nine speakers inside and that too Sennheiser speakers. The SubWoofer is a simple vertical box that connects wirelessly with the soundboard but has a power connection of its own. The soundbar comes with all possible audio connection options and works via AirPlay too. You can use the HDMI option to connect to your TV.

"Sabertooth tigers were dangerous predators, but did they roar or did they purr?",Did sabertooth tigers roar or did they purr? Researchers explore the complex data behind both those possibilities.,"Saber-toothed tigers must have been truly intimidating predators when they walked the Earth millions of years ago. But there is an important question that might determine the scale of how intimidating they would have been to us when humans coexisted with the big cats—do they roar or do they purr?
The answer to that is a little more complicated than you may think. A new study published Sunday in the Journal of Morphology sets out to explore the data behind both possibilities—that of the cats purring and that of the cats roaring.

UAE’s Sultan Al Neyadi shares fascinating video of how honey behaves in space,Have you ever wondered how honey will behave in space? Watch this video from astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi to find out.,"United Arab Emirates (UAE) astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi, the first Emirati astronaut to go on a long-term space mission, shared a video on X (formerly Twitter) of him making and taking a bite out of a honey sandwich on the International Space Station (ISS). The Emirati honey behaves in a fascinating manner once it leaves the bottle.
In the video, Al Neyadi squeezes out a big blob of honey onto what looks like the kind of flatbread eaten by astronauts in space. Interestingly, the normal loaves of bread that we are used to here on Earth is not allowed on space missions because they can create crumbs that can become unmanageable.

"X may remove headlines from tweets with links, leaving only images",The change means users will have to write their own captions or summaries to accompany the links.,"X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, is making a radical change to how it displays news articles on its service. Tweets with links will no longer show any headline or text, but only the lead image of the article, according to a Fortune report.
The change means that users who want to share news articles on X will have to write their own captions or summaries to accompany the links, or else their tweets will only show an image with a URL overlay. Clicking on the image will still take users to the original article on the publisher’s website, but the lack of context could affect how users engage with the content.

"AI unlikely to destroy most jobs, but clerical workers at risk, ILO says",An explosion of interest in generative AI and its chatbot applications has sparked fears over job destruction.,"Generative AI probably will not take over most people’s jobs entirely but will instead automate a portion of their duties, freeing them up to do other tasks, a U.N. study said on Monday.
It warned, however, that clerical work would likely be the hardest hit, potentially hitting female employment harder, given women’s over-representation in this sector, especially in wealthier countries.
An explosion of interest in generative AI and its chatbot applications has sparked fears over job destruction, similar to those that emerged when the moving assembly line was introduced in the early 1900s and after mainframe computers in the 1950s.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, the study produced by the International Labour Organization concludes that: “Most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI.”
This means that “the most important impact of the technology is likely to be of augmenting work”, it adds.
The occupation likely to be most affected by GenAI – capable of generating text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models and other data – is clerical work, where about a quarter of tasks are highly exposed to potential automation, the study says.
But most other professions, like managers and sales workers, are only marginally exposed, it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Still, the U.N. agency’s report warned that the impact of generative AI on affected workers could still be “brutal”.
“Therefore, for policymakers, our study should not read as a calming voice, but rather as a call for harnessing policy to address the technological changes that are upon us,” it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-unlikely-to-destroy-most-jobs-but-clerical-workers-at-risk-ilo-says-8903293/,technology

“Please confirm the parameters,” the voice of the Chandrayaan 2 mission director Ritu Karidhal crackled through the silence after the screens at the mission control room froze up when the Vikram lander was around 335 metres from the surface of the moon – indicating a loss of communication with the lander.

However, users will not be notified if Google reaches out to the developer and asks them to fix the issue. As for extensions laced with malware, Google already has a policy where extensions are automatically disabled if they are found to contain malicious code.

The ruling came in response to Stephen Thaler’s attempt to challenge the government’s refusal to register works made by AI.
Judge Howell said that copyright law has “never stretched so far” to “protect works generated by new forms of technology operating absent any guiding human hand.” She emphasised that U.S. copyright law “protects only works of human creation” and is “designed to adapt with the times.” She added that there has been a consistent understanding that human creativity is “at the core of copyrightability, even as that human creativity is channeled through new tools or into new media.”

"Best 5G phones under Rs 20,000 to buy in August 2023","From the recently launched Redmi 12 5G to the Galaxy M34, here are some of the best mid-range 5G phones that offer a run for the money.","The mid-range smartphone segment has been fiercely competitive in the last few months. While some phones offer great value for money, others focus on a bloatware-free software experience. However, things can get really complex if you are trying to find a phone that does it all under Rs 20,000. From the recently launched Redmi 12 5G to the Samsung Galaxy M34, here are some of the best options in the under Rs 20,000 price bracket.
Redmi 12 5G
Xiaomi’s recently launched Redmi 12 5G (review) also happens to be its most pocket-friendly 5G phone to date.

Sony XV800 wireless party speaker review: Turn your home into a discotheque,SRS-XV800 is built and designed to remain an integral part of your entertainment setup.,"When I was a teenager, the Sony Hi-Fi system was all the rage. Almost everyone I knew had one. I remember how my cousins and I used to select the cassettes to play at cousins’ sangeet ceremonies and other events. Sony doesn’t manufacture Hi-Fi systems anymore, and while times have changed, one thing that still exists is our shared love for music and playing it loud when families and friends get together on special occasions.
The new Sony SRS-XV800 is a wireless Bluetooth-enabled party speaker that delivers big and loud sound from a standalone unit, replacing the Hi-Fi systems of the past. I have never experienced a ‘party’ speaker before, and having heard great things from those who owned the previous generation models, I was rather excited to review the SRS-XV800. Here is my review.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/sony-xv800-wireless-party-speaker-review-8900681/,technology

‘Moon within reach’: Chandrayaan-3 lander completes final deboosting op; descent expected to begin on August 23,"Russia's Luna 25 spacecraft, which is expected to reach the moon between August 21 and 23, suffered a technical glitch during a pre-landing manoeuvre on Saturday","The final deboosting operation of the Chandrayaan-3 mission’s Lander Module (LM) reduced the module’s orbit, drawing the moon within its reach, the Indian Space Research Organisation indicated on Sunday. The national space agency added that the LM would now undergo internal checks.
“The powered descent is expected to commence on August 23, 2023, around 1745 Hrs IST,” ISRO stated over Twitter.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/chandrayaan-3-isro-lander-module-moon-8900476/,technology
Russia’s Luna-25 spacecraft suffers technical glitch in pre-landing manoeuvre,"The spacecraft is scheduled to land on the south pole of the moon on Monday, racing to land on Earth’s satellite ahead of an Indian spacecraft.","Russia reported an “abnormal situation” Saturday on its moon-bound Luna-25 spacecraft, which launched earlier this month. The country’s space agency, Roscosmos, said the spacecraft ran into unspecified trouble while trying to enter a pre-landing orbit, and that its specialists were analysing the situation. “During the operation, an abnormal situation occurred on board the automatic station, which did not allow the manoeuvre to be performed with the specified parameters,” Roscosmos said in a Telegram post.
Roscosmos did not specify whether the incident will prevent Luna-25 from making a landing. The spacecraft is scheduled to land on the south pole of the moon on Monday, racing to land on Earth’s satellite ahead of an Indian spacecraft. The lunar south pole is of particular interest to scientists, who believe the permanently shadowed polar craters may contain water.
The frozen water in the rocks could be transformed by future explorers into air and rocket fuel. Also on Saturday, the Russian spacecraft produced its first results. Though Roscosmos said the information was undergoing analysis, the agency reported that the preliminary data obtained contained information about the chemical elements of the lunar soil and that its equipment had registered a “micrometeorite impact.”

Roscosmos posted images of the Zeeman crater – the third largest in the moon’s southern hemisphere – taken from the spacecraft. The crater has a diameter of 190 kilometers (118 miles) and is eight kilometers (five miles) deep. The launch from Russia’s Vostochny spaceport in the Far East of the Luna-25 craft on August 10 was Russia’s first since 1976 when it was part of the Soviet Union.
The Russian lunar lander was expected to reach the moon between Aug. 21 – 23, around the same time as an Indian craft which was launched on July 14. Only three governments have managed successful moon landings: the Soviet Union, the United States and China.

India and Russia are aiming to be the first to land at the moon’s south pole. Roscosmos said it wants to show Russia “is a state capable of delivering a payload to the moon,” and “ensure Russia’s guaranteed access to the moon’s surface.” Sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine make it harder for the country to access Western technology, impacting its space program. The Luna-25 was initially meant to carry a small moon rover but that idea was abandoned to reduce the weight of the craft for improved reliability, analysts say.
“Foreign electronics are lighter, domestic electronics are heavier,” Egorov said. “While scientists might have the task of studying lunar water, for Roscosmos the main task is simply to land on the moon — to recover lost Soviet expertise and learn how to perform this task in a new era.” The spaceport is a pet project of Russian President Vladimir Putin and is key to his efforts to make Russia a space superpower and move Russian launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. A previous Indian attempt to land at the moon’s south pole in 2019 ended when the lander crashed into the moon’s surface.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/russias-luna-25-spacecraft-technical-glitch-pre-landing-maneuver-8900471/,technology
OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G review: Should you ignore the pricier Nord 3?,"If you’re looking for a phone that looks as blue as a Smurf with a minimal software and hardware design, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G may be your pick.","OnePlus used to be the brand that only made flagship killers, but now it has a whole family of Nord phones that cater to different budget segments and needs. The latest addition is the Nord CE 3 5G, which looks like a twin of the Nord 3 launched last month, but with some compromises in the specs department to bring down the price. Is this phone worth your money? Let’s find out.
A surge of Aqua
The OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G comes in two colours – Aqua Surge and Grey Shimmer. I’m glad I was lent the former for the review because I am obsessed with the way it looks. The phone’s back is sleek and simple, with a refreshing hue that does not play any optical tricks or sparkle like a disco ball like many of the other phones out there – it’s simply all blue. I could gush about the colour for hours, but I should also mention that the phone feels as premium as it looks, with a sturdy build and a nearly bezel-less front.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/oneplus-nord-ce-3-5g-review-8899913/,technology
"Not ChatGPT, but this AI chatbot has visitors spending the most time","Character AI is a unique chatbot that lets users chat with celebrities, historical figures, and fictional characters.","The brisk pace of research and development in AI has led to the introduction of numerous AI tools in the past few months. All of this started after AI powerhouse OpenAI unveiled its sensational chatbot ChatGPT in November last year. In fact, in less than four months ChatGPT went on to become the application with the most active users in the history of Internet. ChatGPT’s popularity prompted many technology companies to introduce their own AI chatbots.
Even as ChatGPT continues to dominate, there seems to be another chatbot that seems to be emerging as more popular. Although ChatGPT is getting the most traffic with millions of monthly visitors, this other chatbot has monthly visitors spending an average eight times higher than ChatGPT.

Elon Musk says X will strip ability to block accounts,"The block function on X allows a user to restrict specific accounts from contacting them, seeing their posts or following them.","Social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, will remove a protective feature that lets users block other accounts, owner Elon Musk said on Friday in another controversial move for the company he bought last year.
The block function on X allows a user to restrict specific accounts from contacting them, seeing their posts or following them.
“Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature’, except for DMs,” Musk said in a post on the platform, referring to direct messages.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said X would retain the mute function, which screens a user from seeing specified accounts but, unlike blocking, does not alert the other account to the action.
The billionaire owner has described himself as a free speech absolutist, but some critics have said his approach is irresponsible. Researchers have found an increase in hate speech and antisemitic content on the platform since he took over, and some governments have accused the company of not doing enough to moderate its content.
Removing or limiting the block feature might bring X into conflict with guidelines incorporated by Apple’s App Store and Alphabet’s Google Play.

Responding to a post from anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinsky urging X to keep the “critical tool to keep people safe online”, Chief Executive Linda Yaccarino defended Musk’s move.
“Our users’ safety on X is our number one priority. And we’re building something better than the current state of block and mute. Please keep the feedback coming,” Yaccarino posted.

Facts About Fiction | Thought those robot videos are real? Here’s how you can identify CGI videos,"Videos can be digitally altered using CGI or Computer Generated Imagery, which is the process of creating still or animated visual content with computer software. Here’s how to identify such videos.","Recently, a few videos showing the flawless abilities of the robots were widely shared on social media platforms. In one of the videos, a robot was seen playing table tennis and beating a human at the game.
Will humans ever beat robots? And it's only the beginning 😳.
Man vs robot live video👇

Another video claimed that a robot was sent from the UK to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
While many believed these videos to be real, they were actually digitally altered. Such videos are usually generated using Computer Generated Imagery (CGI).
ADVERTISEMENT
CGI creates still or animated visual content with various computer software. It can be used to create both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) effects.
Here’s how you can identify CGI videos:
1. Observe the video
The mistakes that we often ignore at first glance become the things that we should really focus upon when we look at such videos. If you take the first video for example, and observe it carefully, you will see that the feet of the robot blend with the floor. This is a clear giveaway that the viral video is digitally altered. Such videos, if edited poorly, are also blurry.
2. Look at the background carefully
It is important to carefully look at the background. These videos are not flawless and there would be at least one visual clue hiding in the background. In the second video of the robot meeting the Ukraine President, if the robot and its movements are observed carefully, a blurred background can be seen.
ADVERTISEMENT
3. Check the light and the shadows
The shadows of the objects reveal a lot of things. The problem with shadow renders is that it is an actual layer that you have to blend with reality and it is tough. It is very easy to spot a fake video based on the location of the sun and the position of the shadow that it creates. In CGI videos, if poorly edited, there are two extremes — either the shadow is dark or there is no shadow at all.
4. Observe the motion
Getting the motion of the object correct in CGI can be difficult. The moment an object that is supposed to be stationary is seen moving around, there is a part that comes into picture, which is momentum and inertia. For example, if one body part moves the others move along with it, that is if humans lift their hands, the shoulders move too, and the entire body feels the jerk or the movement. This is not necessarily the case with the objects shown in such videos.
5. Check actions of the robot
If the video is of a robot, check for its actions. For example, robot’s ability to move one joint at a time gives them away. They have slow motions, they don’t blink like humans. There are a lot of things robots cannot do like humans. And hence, if the movements are flawless, they are jumping like humans, the video is definitely altered.
6. Use reverse image search
Take the screenshots of the video and run a reverse image search using Google or Yandex. Check if the video is available elsewhere. Check the results, you might find the original video on the first attempt. People who make CGI videos often share it in the caption of their posts and hence finding the source is important.

Any video that does not clarify your doubts should not be trusted as original and not shared before verification.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/robot-videos-cgi-identification-8899457/,technology
NASA moves mobile launcher to launchpad for Artemis 2 crewed Moon mission tests,NASA has moved the mobile launcher tower for the Artemis 2 mission to the launch pad to conduct some tests ahead of the crewed mission to the Moon.,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said Thursday that it moved the mobile launch tower for the crewed Artemis 2 mission to Launchpad 39B of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The launcher will remain at the pad for many months as teams from the space agency prepare for the first crewed mission of the Artemis program.
This mobile launcher will be used to transport NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft to the launch pad for liftoff. But before that, it must first go through a series of tests conducted by the agency’s Exploration Ground Systems. This will include testing the launchpad’s new 5.2 million litre liquid hydrogen sphere and emergency egress system.

From Mad Men to machines? Big advertisers shift to AI,"While lawmakers and philosophers alike still debate whether content produced by generative AI models amounts to anything like human creativity, advertisers have already begun using the technology in their promotional campaigns.","Some of the world’s biggest advertisers, from food giant Nestle to consumer goods multinational Unilever, are experimenting with using generative AI software like ChatGPT and DALL-E to cut costs and increase productivity, executives say.
But many companies remain wary of security and copyright risks as well as the dangers of unintended biases baked into the raw information feeding the software, meaning humans will remain part of the process for the foreseeable future.
Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which can be used to produce content based on past data, has become a buzzword over the past year, capturing the public’s imagination and sparking interest across many industries.
ADVERTISEMENT
Marketing teams hope it will result in cheaper, faster and virtually limitless ways to advertise products.
Investment is already ramping up amid expectations AI could forever alter the way advertisers bring products to market, executives at two top consumer goods companies and the world’s biggest ad agency told Reuters.
The technology can be used to create seemingly original text, images, and even computer code, based on training, instead of simply categorizing or identifying data like other AI.
WPP, the world’s biggest advertising agency, is working with consumer goods companies including Nestle and Oreo-maker Mondelez to use generative AI in advertising campaigns, its CEO Mark Read said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The savings can be 10 or 20 times,” Read said in an interview. “Rather than flying a film crew down to Africa to shoot a commercial, we’ve created that virtually.”
In India, WPP worked with Mondelez on an AI-driven Cadbury campaign with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, producing ads that ‘featured’ the actor asking passers-by to shop at 2,000 local stores during Diwali.
Small businesses used a microsite to generate versions of the ads featuring their own store that could be posted on social media and other platforms. Some 130,000 ads were created featuring 2,000 stores which gained 94 million views across YouTube and Facebook, according to WPP.
WPP has “20 young people in their early twenties who are AI apprentices” in London, Read said, and has partnered with the University of Oxford on courses focused on the future of marketing. The “AI for business” diploma offers training in data and AI for client leaders, practitioners, and WPP executives, according to WPP’s website.
ADVERTISEMENT
The team work under AI expert Daniel Hulme who was appointed chief AI officer at WPP two years ago.
“It’s much easier to think about all the jobs that will be disrupted than all the jobs that will be created,” Read said.
Nestle is also working on ways to use ChatGPT 4.0 and Dall-E 2 to help market its products, Aude Gandon, its Global Chief Marketing Officer and an ex-Google executive, said in an emailed statement.
“The engine is answering campaign briefs with great ideas and inspiration that are fully on brand and on strategy,” Gandon said.
“The ideas are then further developed by the creative team to ultimately become content that will be produced, for example for our websites.”
ADVERTISEMENT
While lawmakers and philosophers alike still debate whether content produced by generative AI models amounts to anything like human creativity, advertisers have already begun using the technology in their promotional campaigns.
Imagined scenes
In one instance, Dutch gallery Rijksmuseum’s research team went viral online on Sept 8, 2022 after using X-Ray to reveal new objects hidden in Baroque artist Johannes Vermeer’s oil painting ‘The Milkmaid’.
Less than 24 hours later, WPP used OpenAI’s generator system DALL-E 2 to “reveal” its own imagined scenes beyond the borders of the painting’s frame in a public YouTube ad for Nestle’s La Laitière — or Milkmaid — yogurt and dairy brand.
Through almost 1,000 iterations, the video of Nestle’s version of The Milkmaid generated 700,000 euros ($766,010) of “media value” for the Swiss food giant. Media value is the cost of advertising needed to generate the same public exposure.
ADVERTISEMENT
WPP said the content cost it nothing to make. A spokesperson for the Rijksmuseum said it had an open data policy for non-copyrighted images, meaning anyone can use its images.
Nestle is not alone in its experiments.
Unilever, which owns more than 400 brands including Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, has its own generative AI technology that can write product descriptions for retailers’ websites and digital commerce sites, it said.
The company’s TRESemmé haircare brand has used its AI content generator for written content and its automation tool for visual content on Amazon.co.uk.
But Unilever is concerned about copyrights, intellectual property, privacy and data, Aaron Rajan, its global vice president of Go To Market Technology, told Reuters.
ADVERTISEMENT
The company wants to prevent its technology from reproducing human biases, like racial or gender stereotypes, that might be embedded in the data it processes.
“Ensuring that these models when you type in certain terms are coming back with an unstereotyped view of the world is really critical,” he said.
Nestle’s Gandon told Reuters the company was “keeping security and privacy top-of-mind.”
Consumer companies are using data from retailers like Walmart, Carrefour and Kroger to power their AI tools, said Martin Sorrell, executive chair of advertising group S4 Capital and the founder of WPP.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You’ve got two buckets of clients: one that is jumping in fully and the other that is saying ‘let’s experiment’,” he said.
Some consumer goods firms remain wary of security risks or copyright breaches, industry executives say.
“If you want a rule of thumb: consider everything you tell an AI service as if it were a really juicy piece of gossip. Would you want it getting out?,” said Ben King, VP of customer trust at Okta, a provider of online authentication services.
“Would you want someone else knowing the same sort of thing about you?,” he added. “If not, don’t tell the AI.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/using-ai-in-advertising-8899323/,technology
Reliance Jio launches Netflix subscription on prepaid plans,"Jio, the telecom arm of Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries, said that around 400 million prepaid customers will have the option of availing a Netflix subscription through two packages.","Reliance Jio Infocomm said on Friday it has launched a Netflix subscription on prepaid plans, a move that could intensify competition among domestic telecom companies as well as help the video-streaming provider find other avenues to make money.
Jio, the telecom arm of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, said that around 400 million prepaid customers will have the option of availing a Netflix subscription through two packages, each valid for up to 84 days.
One will be priced at 1,099 rupees ($13.23), providing access to Netflix on mobile platforms, and the other for 1,499 rupees, which will give access to a basic package for large screens, Jio said.

Jio’s peers, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea , provide subscription to Netflix rival Walt Disney’s India streaming service Disney+ Hotstar through prepaid bundled plans.
“Partnership with Jio will give more customers access to this exciting line-up of Indian content as well as some incredible stories from around the world,” said Tony Zameczkowski, vice president of APAC partnerships for Netflix.
The deal comes amid Netflix looking for new ways to make money as it faces signs of market saturation in the United States, with efforts including limits on password borrowing and a new ad-supported option.
Disney+ Hotstar, which topped India’s streaming market between January 2022 and March 2023 with a 38% share of viewership also plans to limit password sharing in the country, Reuters reported in July.

The mission launched from the Sathish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota on July 14. After multiple manoeuvres in Earth orbit, it entered a lunar orbit on August 5. It then went through some orbit reduction manoeuvres while in a lunar orbit on August 6, 9 and 14. This was followed by the fifth and final lunar-bound

WhatsApp allows you to send images in HD: Here’s how to do it,WhatsApp now lets you send photos in HD quality. Here’s how to do it in 5 easy steps.,"WhatsApp is known to heavily compress images when you send them across and people resultantly tend to use other platforms to transfer full-size images, especially if they are taken with a high-resolution camera or have a lot of details. Others send the image as a document if they’re aware of the workaround.
But with a new update, the messaging platform has now officially done away with this shortcoming. WhatsApp’s latest version adds a new option to send images in ‘HD’ resolution, with a promise of support for HD videos on the way.

Top ex-Google Brain researchers start AI research company in Tokyo,"Sakana AI, founded by David Ha and Llion Jones, declined to disclose funding details.","Two prominent former Google researchers, one of whom was a co-inventor of the “transformer” artificial intelligence architecture that paved the way for the generative AI boom, announced on Thursday they had started a new AI company based in Tokyo.
Sakana AI, founded by David Ha and Llion Jones, declined to disclose funding details.
Jones is the fifth author on Google’s 2017 research paper “Attention Is All You Need”, which introduced the “transformer” deep learning architecture that went on to become the basis for viral chatbot ChatGPT and the current race to develop products powered by generative AI. Ha was previously the head of research at Stability AI and a Google Brain researcher.

After the famous paper came out, advances in generative AI foundation models have centered around making the “transformer”-based models larger and larger. Instead of doing that, Sakana AI will focus on creating new architectures for foundation models, Jones told Reuters.
“Rather than building one huge model that sucks all this data, our approach could be using a large number of smaller models, each with their own unique advantage and smaller data set, and having these models communicate and work with each other to solve a problem,” said Ha, though he clarified this was just an idea.

It comes amid a recent boom in generative AI models such as ChatGPT, which make it far easier to create convincing fake videos, images, text, and computer code. Security officials have warned of such models being used by cybercriminals.
Generative AI would enable groups with limited resources to produce higher quality content for influence campaigns at scale, Mandiant researchers said.
A pro-China information campaign named Dragonbridge, for instance, had expanded “exponentially” across 30 social platforms and 10 different languages since it first began by targetting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2019, said Sandra Joyce, vice president at Mandiant Intelligence.
Yet, the impact of such campaigns was limited. “From an effectiveness standpoint, not a lot of wins there,” she said. “They really haven’t changed the course of the threat landscape just yet.”

China has denied U.S. accusations of involvement in such influence campaigns in the past.
Mandiant, which helps public and private organisations respond to digital breaches, said it hadn’t yet seen AI play a key role in threats from Russia, Iran, China, or North Korea. AI use for digital intrusions is expected to remain low in the near term, the researchers said.
“Thus far, we haven’t seen a single incident response where AI played a role,” said Joyce. “They haven’t really been brought into any kind of practical usage that outweighs what could be done with normal tooling that we’ve seen.”

The organisation which is behind ‘AP Style’ – English publications’ go-to writing and editing reference – listed some fairly basic rules surrounding the emerging technology, concluding that it does “not see AI as a replacement of journalists in any way.”
The AP has allowed journalists to experiment with AI tools like ChatGPT, provided that they exercise caution and do not use it to create publishable content. The organisation also stresses that any output from a generative AI tool should be treated as “unvetted source material,” meaning journalists are needed to apply their editorial judgement and AP’s sourcing standards before using such information. In other words, journalists are required to rigorously fact-check all AI-generated material before using it.

Marshall Middleton review: Loud with nuance,My first impression of the Marshall was simple — loud and bass.,"“It’s too loud…,” my sleepy-eyed 12-year-old complains as I try to wake him up on a school day. He’s referring to the podcast I’m playing on Marshall Middleton in the living room. I am happy the speaker has done its job well and the fact is sitting just next to it I did not feel it was too loud. That’s the effect this compact Bluetooth speaker delivers effectively every time you play it.
The Middleton is a very Marshall-looking Bluetooth speaker. But it is more compact and portable than units I have seen from this brand before. The built quality is great with a gold finish speaker grill up front with the Marshall logo and another gold toggle on top which acts as the power button and lets you adjust volume and skip songs. On the left of this is an LED strip that shows the battery level and to the right are bass and treble controls. The gold looks great, but I would have preferred the black and not the cream, a colour I think will get soiled soon under Indian conditions.

New York City bans TikTok on government-owned devices over security concerns,"TikTok, which is used by more than 150 million Americans and is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance.","New York City on Wednesday banned TikTok on government-owned devices, citing security concerns, joining a number of U.S. cities and states that have put such restrictions on the short video sharing app.
TikTok, which is used by more than 150 million Americans and is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has faced growing calls from U.S. lawmakers for a nationwide ban over concerns about possible Chinese government influence.
TikTok “posed a security threat to the city’s technical networks,” the administration of New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement.

New York City agencies are required to remove the app within 30 days and employees will lose access to the app and its website on city-owned devices and networks. New York State had already banned TikTok on state-issued mobile devices.
TikTok said it “has not shared, and would not share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government, and has taken substantial measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok users.”
Top U.S. security officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray and CIA Director William Burns have said TikTok poses a threat. Wray said in March that China’s government could use TikTok to control software on millions of devices and drive narratives to divide Americans, adding the app “screams” of national security concerns.
Former President Donald Trump in 2020 sought to bar new downloads of TikTok, but a series of court decisions blocked the ban from taking effect.

Many U.S. states and cities have restricted TikTok on government devices. Montana recently passed a bill banning the app across the state, a rule set to go into effect on Jan. 1 and being challenged legally.
Close to half of American adults support a ban on TikTok, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey released on Wednesday.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/new-york-city-bans-tiktok-on-government-owned-devices-over-security-concerns-8896425/,technology

Researchers use cloud to replicate supercomputer for heart disease study,The study simulated a therapy that aims to dissolve blood clots and tumor cells in the human circulatory system that required an enormous amount of computing power.,"A scientist at Harvard used Google’s cloud platform to clone a supercomputer for a heart disease study, in a novel move that other researchers could follow to get around a shortage of powerful computing resources and speed up their work.
The study simulated a therapy that aims to dissolve blood clots and tumor cells in the human circulatory system that required an enormous amount of computing power that typically can be harnessed with a supercomputer, according to Harvard professor Petros Koumoutsakos.
“The big problem that we had (was) we could run one simulation using a full scale supercomputer,” Koumoutsakos said, adding that refining or optimizing the simulation required further access to the supercomputer.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the U.S., there are only a handful of supercomputers that are capable of running the billions of calculations to accurately mimic the conditions in Koumoutsakos’s study.
The small number of machines capable of performing the research has created bottlenecks in the scientific process, according to Citadel Securities research platform head Costas Bekas.
To eliminate the bottlenecks researchers and companies such as Citadel that need an enormous amount of computing resources only found in supercomputers have begun to turn to the public cloud. But cloud computing operations aren’t designed to handle the demands researchers have. They are designed for millions of individual, relatively small computing tasks – things such as streaming video, serving webpages or database access. The cloud is usually built for reliability and resilience.
“Folks are realizing the potential for cloud to solve problems and technical scientific engineering computing to really unlock productivity and get to better answers, better insights, faster,” said Bill Magro chief high performance computing technologist at Google Cloud.

Modifying cloud infrastructure to behave like a supercomputer requires changes in the software, networking and physical design of the hardware, Magro said.

Failed star is a record-breaking ‘Jupiter’ hotter than the Sun,"A newly-discovered ""hot-Jupiter"" has a surface temperature 2,000 degrees hotter than that of our Sun.","Hot Jupiters are curious cosmic bodies. They are kind of like our Jupiter but they orbit very close to their stars, sometimes completing an entire orbit in just weeks or even hours, meaning that they have extremely hot surface temperatures. A new hot Jupiter discovered by astronomers has a surface temperature 2,000 degrees hotter than that of our Sun.
In a study published in Nature Astronomy, scientists write on the discovery of a system that consists of two bodies located about 1,400 light-years away. This system offers an unprecedented opportunity to study hot Jupiter atmospheres in particular while also helping advance our understanding of planetary and stellar evolution, according to the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Notch on iMac? Apple patent reveals plans for Face ID on MacBooks & desktops,"Apple has patented a way to bring Face ID to MacBooks and desktops, using a notch and infrared light.","First introduced on the MacBooks back in 2016, Touch ID has remained the staple form of authentication on those macOS-powered devices ever since. It’s convenient, it’s fast, and nothing beats the technology in terms of security. However, a new patent hints that Apple could be working on an alternative to the touch-powered authentication method.
As reported by Apple Insider, the patent titled “Light Recognition Module for Determining a User of a Computing Device” describes how the camera on top of the display (now in a notch) could recognize the user’s face and take them to the home screen automatically. The patent says that “to prevent unauthorized users from accessing this sensitive data, these computing devices may incorporate systems and mechanisms for authenticating users.”

Infinix GT 10 Pro review: A blisteringly fast gaming smartphone with striking design,A gaming phone with best-in-class specs and flashy design.,"Gaming smartphones can cost as much as a flagship phones. However, Infinix is set to change this notion with the launch of the GT 10 Pro, a mid-range phone that’s unlike anything else on the market. Besides a solid specs sheet, the Infinix GT 10 Pro also goes for a quirky design that is heavily inspired by the Nothing Phone 2. I used the Infinix GT 10 Pro for a week, and here is my review.
The retail box can also be used as a sound amplifier (Image credit: Infinix)
Unboxing experience
The smartphone unboxing experience has gotten worse over the years, where brands mostly include the phone and a charging cable in the name of being eco-friendly. Infinix on the other hand takes a different route and offers what could possibly be the best smartphone unboxing experience in 2023.

India’s Ola Electric eyes higher sales with affordable e-scooters,"The new e-scooter models, S1X and S1X+, will be priced at 99,999 rupees ($1,199.15) and 109,999 rupees, respectively.","Ola Electric, India’s largest maker of electric scooters, launched its most affordable rides on Tuesday, in an effort to woo more buyers as the price of e-scooters moves closer to gasoline models.
The SoftBank Group-backed company also plans to launch four e-motorcycles by end-2024.
The new e-scooter models, S1X and S1X+, will be priced at 99,999 rupees ($1,199.15) and 109,999 rupees, respectively, with the cheapest variant of S1X about 36% lower than Bangalore-based Ola’s most expensive e-scooter, the S1 Pro, which sells for 140,000 rupees.

The least expensive gasoline scooter in India costs about 64,000 rupees.
Gasoline two-wheelers account for the bulk of automobile sales in India and crossed 5 million units last fiscal, of which electric models made up around 15%, industry data showed.
The government wants this to grow to 70% by 2030 and is offering incentives to boost sales.
Ola has launched cheaper scooters through a new generation platform, reducing production costs by 25%, founder and Chief Executive Bhavish Aggarwal told Reuters.

The company, which first began selling electric scooters in 2021 and competes with start-ups like Ather Energy, leads the e-scooter market with a 32% share. Valued at $5 billion last year, Ola sold around 95,000 e-scooters from April-August 2023, industry data showed.
While the new models will boost Ola’s market share, Aggarwal said his focus is to increase EV penetration in India and wants electric models to comprise the majority of scooter sales by next year.
“Our goal is eventually to bring the upfront price of an EV equal to internal combustion engine models … without any government incentives.”The IPO-bound company also plans to expand its plant’s annual production capacity to 2 million units from 500,000 currently, and double the number of experience stores to 2,000.
Ola recorded an operating loss of $136 million on a revenue of $335 million in the fiscal ended March 2023, Reuters reported.

"Musk’s X delays access to content on Reuters, NY Times, social media rivals",Clicking a link on X to one of the affected websites resulted in a delay of about five seconds before the webpage loaded.,"Social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, delayed access to links to content on the Reuters and New York Times websites as well as rivals like Bluesky, Facebook and Instagram, according to a Washington Post report on Tuesday.
Clicking a link on X to one of the affected websites resulted in a delay of about five seconds before the webpage loaded, the Washington Post reported, citing tests it conducted on Tuesday. Reuters also saw a similar delay in tests it ran.
By late Tuesday afternoon, X appeared to have eliminated the delay. When contacted for comment, X confirmed the delay was removed but did not elaborate.
ADVERTISEMENT
Billionaire Elon Musk, who bought Twitter in October, has previously lashed out at news organizations and journalists who have reported critically on his companies, which include Tesla and SpaceX. Twitter has previously prevented users from posting links to competing social media platforms.
Reuters could not establish the precise time when X began delaying links to some websites.
A user on Hacker News, a tech forum, posted about the delay earlier on Tuesday and wrote that X began delaying links to the New York Times on Aug. 4. On that day, Musk criticized the publication’s coverage of South Africa and accused it of supporting calls for genocide. Reuters has no evidence that the two events are related.
A spokesperson for the New York Times said it has not received an explanation from X about the link delay.

“While we don’t know the rationale behind the application of this time delay, we would be concerned by targeted pressure applied to any news organization for unclear reasons,” the spokesperson said on Tuesday.
A Reuters spokesperson said: “We are aware of the report in the Washington Post of a delay in opening links to Reuters stories on X. We are looking into the matter.
“Bluesky, an X rival that has Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on its board, did not reply to a request for comment.

Moderate Democratic coalition creates AI working group,"Artificial intelligence has been used for several years, it surged in popularity earlier this year with the rise of ChatGPT.","Moderate Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have formed a working group on artificial intelligence aimed at tackling the issue of what restrictions, if any, should be put on the technology.
The New Democrat Coalition announced the formation of the group on Tuesday, saying it would work with the Biden administration, companies and other lawmakers to develop “sensible, bipartisan policies to address this emerging technology.”
While artificial intelligence has been used for several years, it surged in popularity earlier this year with the rise of ChatGPT because of generative AI’s ability to use data to create human-seeming prose. Lawmakers are assessing ways to mitigate the potential harms – particularly to national security – while taking advantage of its strengths.

The group is to be headed by Representative Derek Kilmer, a Democrat from Washington state.
Vice chairs are Representatives Don Beyer of Virginia, Jeff Jackson from North Carolina, Sara Jacobs of California, Susie Lee of Nevada and Haley Stevens from Michigan.
In July, the White House announced that AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta Platforms had made voluntary commitments to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer.
In the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said last month that lawmakers would hear from developers, executives and experts later this year on possible legislative safeguards.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/moderate-democratic-coalition-creates-ai-working-group-8894486/,technology
OpenAI says AI tools can be effective in content moderation,"Despite the hype around generative AI, companies such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet are yet to monetize the technology.","ChatGPT creator OpenAI made a strong case for the use of AI in content moderation, saying it can unlock efficiencies at social media firms by speeding up the time it takes to handle some of the grueling tasks.
Despite the hype around generative AI, companies such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet are yet to monetize the technology in which they have been pumping billions of dollars in the hope that it will have a big impact across industries.
OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, said its latest GPT-4 AI model can reduce the process of content moderation to a few hours from months and ensure more consistent labeling.

Content moderation can be a grueling task for social media firms such as Facebook-parent Meta, which works with thousands of moderators around the world to block users from seeing harmful content such as child pornography and images of extreme violence.
“The process (of content moderation) is inherently slow and can lead to mental stress on human moderators,” OpenAI said. “With this system, the process of developing and customizing content policies is trimmed down from months to hours.”
Separately, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Tuesday that the startup does not train its AI models on user-generated data.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-says-ai-tools-can-be-effective-in-content-moderation-8894478/,technology

Redmi Watch 3 Active review: A fine example for watch software design,I’ve barely taken off the Redmi Watch 3 Active since I got it. Here’s why.,"Smartwatches have come a long way. Nowadays, you can hardly go wrong with any smartwatch above Rs 2,000. But some brands still do it better than others. One of them is Redmi, whose Watch 3 Active has been on my wrist for a week now. And I love it. It’s ridiculously easy to use, is packed with features, and has an interface that makes you wonder if you really need a full-fledged smartwatch. Here’s my review.
Design and fit
Let’s start with the design. The Redmi Watch 3 Active has a solid metal frame that feels durable and premium. Its display is the kind that doesn’t sit flush into the frame – it pops out a little which gives it a more premium look. The watch comes in two colours – black and off-white – but you can also spice things up with an olive green strap for Rs 499 (that’s like a sixth of the watch’s price itself) if you’re feeling adventurous. I got the black one for review and I like its sleek and minimalist look.

Yes, we are talking about the iPad Pro M2. But that doesn’t really run macOS, so it doesn’t count. What a bummer.
And Windows PCs that support touch are everywhere, so it’s not like Apple can’t make a Mac with a touch screen. The almost $3 trillion-worth company definitely has the resources to create one – it simply doesn’t want to. But what if we told you that the Mac of our dreams does exist?

Virtus Motors Alpha M e-bike review: An Indian cycle for Indian roads,The Virtus Motors Alpha M is also vying for attention in the electric bicycle segment touting its made-in-India credentials and relatively affordable price tag.,"I have tried a couple of electric bikes over the past few years and while the convenience of an electric motor that assists your pedalling efforts is understandable, I have not really been a big fan of the concept and might as well buy a more comfortable electric scooter at a slightly higher cost. But clearly, my opinion is in the minority and this is why companies big and small are entering this segment.
The Virtus Motors Alpha M is also vying for attention in the electric bicycle segment touting its made-in-India credentials and relatively affordable price tag. But is that enough in this segment and how will users compare it with let’s say a more popular brand like Hero? This was top of my mind when I started my review.

Netflix to make its games playable on more devices,Users can play the games on TV using their phones and those on PCs and Macs can play on Netflix.com with a keyboard and mouse.,"Netflix will test games on select TVs and computers in a first step to make them playable on more devices, the company’s vice president of Games Mike Verdu wrote in a blog post on Monday.
The company is rolling out a limited beta test to a small group of members in Canada and the United Kingdom on select TVs starting Monday, and on PCs and Macs through Netflix.com on supported browsers in the next few weeks.
The streaming platform had begun its push into the gaming experience by launching Netflix games on mobiles in November 2021. So far, the company’s titles have only been available on Apple’s iOS and Alphabet’s Android.

“Oxenfree” from Night School Studio, a Netflix Game Studio, and “Molehew’s Mining Adventure”, a gem-mining arcade game, will be part of the initial testing.
Users can play the games on TV using their phones and those on PCs and Macs can play on Netflix.com with a keyboard and mouse.
“By making games available on more devices, we hope to make games even easier to play for our members around the world,” Verdu said.
Netflix said games on TV will operate on select devices from initial partners Amazon Fire TV Streaming Media Players, Chromecast with Google TV and Roku devices, among others.

Australian court fines Dell unit $6.5 mln for misleading customers on discounts,Dell Australia was found guilty by the Federal Court in June to have misled customers about the prices or discounts.,"Australia’s Federal Court on Monday ordered Dell Technologies Inc’s local unit to pay A$10 million ($6.46 million) in penalties for making misleading representations on its website about discounts for add-on computer monitors.
In a legal action brought by the country’s competition regulator, Dell Australia was found guilty by the Federal Court in June to have misled customers about the prices or discounts on add-on monitors on its website.
“This outcome sends a strong message to businesses that making false representations about prices or inflating discounts is a serious breach of consumer law and will attract substantial penalties,” said Liza Carver, commissioner of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
Dell Australia, which sold more than 5,300 add-on monitors with overstated discounts between Aug. 2019 and Dec. 16, 2021, will be working “with impacted customers to provide appropriate refunds plus interest and are taking steps to improve our pricing processes to ensure this sort of error does not happen again”, a spokesperson for Dell Australia said in a statement to Reuters.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/australian-court-fines-dell-unit-6-5-mln-for-misleading-customers-on-discounts-8893126/,technology

How Shortwave tamed my inbox with smart organisation and a dash of AI,"I tried Shortwave, an email app that uses AI to summarise and reply to messages (among other things), and here’s what I think.","I have a confession to make: I’m a one-email kind of person. That means everything from work, personal, social, and even spam messages end up in the same Gmail inbox. You can imagine how messy and chaotic that can get, especially when I receive about 50 emails per day. Sometimes I miss important work emails because they get buried under the avalanche of newsletters, promotions, and random offers. That’s why I was curious to try Shortwave, an email app created by ex-Googlers that claims to “cut through the noise”. And boy, did it deliver.
The first thing that struck me about Shortwave was how it organises emails. As someone who hadn’t gone through the fine print (I assume most people wouldn’t), the interface did take some figuring out and getting used to. Shortwave sorts emails into categories: Updates, Promotions, Newsletters, or Social. This was super useful in helping me decide which emails to attend to and which ones to ignore.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/shortwave-email-app-review-8892360/,technology

"Chandrayaan-3 undergoes another orbit reduction maneuver, gets closer to Moon’s surface","Chandrayaan-3, the country's ambitious third Moon mission, had entered into lunar orbit on August 5","Chandrayaan-3 ventured closer to the lunar surface on Monday with another successful maneuver of the spacecraft by ISRO, the national space agency said. The Bengaluru-headquartered space agency said the spacecraft has now achieved a “near-circular orbit” around the Moon.
Post its launch on July 14, Chandrayaan-3, the country’s ambitious third Moon mission, had entered into lunar orbit on August 5, following which two orbit reduction maneuvers were carried out on the spacecraft on August 6 and 9. “Orbit circularisation phase commences. Precise maneuver performed today has achieved a near-circular orbit of 150 km x 177 km,” ISRO said in a tweet. The next operation is planned for August 16, around 08.30 am, it said.
As the mission progresses, a series of maneuvers is being conducted by ISRO to gradually reduce Chandrayaan-3’s orbit and position it over the lunar poles.

According to ISRO sources, one more maneuver will be performed on the spacecraft on August 16 to reach 100 km orbit, following which the landing module, comprising the lander and rover will break away from the propulsion module.
After this, the lander is expected to undergo a “deboost” (the process of slowing down) and make a soft landing on the south polar region of the Moon on August 23.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/chandrayaan-3-undergoes-another-orbit-reduction-maneuver-gets-closer-to-moons-surface-8891984/,technology

HP Envy x360 with ‘IMAX-enhanced’ notebook review: Have a good time at the movies,"If you're in the market for a stylish, powerful laptop with a movie-friendly OLED display, the HP Envy x360 is a good choice.","I vividly remember when I bought the HP Pavilion desktop back in 2004. Its multimedia features – especially the Harman/Kardon speakers – made me excited about the computer. Unlike now when every laptop offers a standardised experience, back in the day computers stood for certain features and you get them for unique experiences. The new HP Envy x360 brings back the good old days with a laptop that earns the title of the first IMAX-enhanced PC. Chances are you might have experienced a movie in the IMAX format and are familiar with the viewing quality. But does the HP Envy x360 really have a stunning screen, or is the IMAX certification just a gimmick? I tried to find the possible answer, and probably more in my review of the HP Envy x360.
HP Envy x360 15 price in India (as reviewed): Rs 99,999
Beautifully designed
I absolutely love the Envy x360’s aesthetic, and it is easily the most satisfying Windows laptop I have ever carried around in a long time. It looks sleek and modern with the lid and bottom bezel having an HP logo, while the chassis is made of recycled aluminium. My review unit came in a shade of black and while it does attract a lot of fingerprints, the device looks classy. If you like 2-in-1 laptops, the Envy’s solid hinges help you position the laptop in a tent or tablet mode. The port selection is good and so does the 5MP IR webcam. I travelled with the HP Envy x360 mainly, due to its portability. It is so light that you can tuck this notebook in your backpack, and forget it’s there.

"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 review: The flagship business phone, now thinner and stronger",The Fold5 is a flagship phone in every sense and capable of doing everything you expect from a top-shelf phone.,"There are two ways to look at foldable phones. One, they fold away so that a full-size smartphone becomes more portable. Two, they unfold to reveal a larger screen inside what looks like a regular-sized smartphone. Samsung has perfected both these forms over the past few years, but it has more experience with the latter. And that is what is up for show with the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5.
The Fold5 is way more portable than its predecessors (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/The Indian Express)
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 review: What’s new?
With the new Fold5, Samsung has not gone for a design overhaul or added new hardware elements. But there are important changes. The most visible one is in terms of the Flex Hinge. Samsung’s latest version of this hinge lets the phone close more tightly than before and this means the device is about 2mm thinner when folded. This makes the Fold5 way more portable than its predecessors — the two sides now fold flat without any space between the two. Samsung has also made the S-Pen thinner, though you need to invest in an additional cover to get hold of one.

"Under a Thousand: Add a 3.5 mm audio jack to your phone, and charge it too!",The adapter does more than just give you access to a 3.5 mm audio jack and a Type C port at the same time.,"It might not have totally disappeared, but the trusty 3.5 mm audio jack does seem well on its way out of our smartphone lives. Phones and tablets above Rs 20,000 are increasingly deserting the port, leaving their users with no choice but to go wireless for their personal audio or invest in a dongle to connect their wired earphones to the phone. The problem with dongles, however, is that many (like the ones from Apple and Google) add a 3.5 mm jack to your device but because they are plugged into the USB Type-C port of the device they are connected to, you often lose the option of using that port. It might not sound like a big deal, except when you suddenly realise that you need to charge your phone but do not want to stop listening to a song or podcast over your favourite pair of headphones.
Dongles that plug into your phone or tablet and still give you access to a USB Type C port, as well as a 3.5 mm audio jack, do exist but either tend to cost a pretty penny or tend to add to the bulk of your device. The Ugreen USB-C to 3.5 mm audio adapter does neither, making it a great option for those who seek the best of both wired worlds – audio as well as charging.

Legacy tech? Hyderabad-based startup lets you create online wills,"In an interview with indianexpress.com, Vishal Mehta, Director at Mitt Arv, explains why he created the platform that simplifies listing of a person's assets.","“When my batchmate from IIM-Calcutta passed away during the Covid-19 Delta wave, he left behind a two-year-old daughter.

Mehta, who works for Microsoft and is based in Singapore, started Mitt Arv in early 2022 with Ashwin Jain who is co-founder and CTO at the Hyderabad-based startup. Mehta is the director of the firm.

"Watch this space: Chandrayaan-3, Luna-25 race against backdrop of Indo-Russia cooperation","India's Chandrayaan-3 and Russia's Luna-25 are in a bit of a ""race"" to be the first mission to reach the lunar south pole. But this race belies the long history of cooperation in space between the two countries.","Nearly a month after ISRO’s Chandrayaan-3 launched from Sriharikota, Russian space agency Roscosmos, launched the Luna-25 mission from the Vosthochny cosmodrome. India has never landed on the Moon, and Russia is doing it for the first time in 47 years. Both missions might land on August 23.
Okay, it isn’t technically true to say that Russia is doing it for the first time in 47 years, because when it sent the last lunar probe, the country was a part of the Soviet Union. But it wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that this is Russia’s first lunar probe. Despite the technicality, the country has a storied pedigree in space exploration, second only to the United States.

San Francisco moves to center of robotaxi universe after California agency vote,Cruise and Waymo have been running experimental services limited by times and geographic areas within San Francisco.,"California just supercharged the self-driving car industry.
Following a contentious state agency vote, Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and General Motors’ Cruise are allowed to take paying passengers day or night throughout San Francisco, solidifying the tech hub as the center of the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry. It marks a significant step forward for the nascent technology.
The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday sided with the companies in the face of vigorous opposition from some residents and city agencies. Commissioners heard more than six hours of public comment from residents and special interest groups supporting or opposing the measure that would expand paid autonomous vehicle service.
ADVERTISEMENT
Transportation and safety agencies, such as the police and fire departments, as well as many residents had opposed expanding paid robotaxi service because of what they said were concerns about erratic driving and interference with their operations. The agencies, which have no regulatory authority, lobbied forcefully for a more measured rollout of the experimental vehicles.
In favor of the expansion were technologists and residents who said they felt the cars offer a safer alternative to human drivers and are a critical boost to San Francisco’s economy.
The companies now have permission to begin citywide paid taxi service at all hours of the day and have said they plan to deploy more cars as a result. They collectively have more than 500 autonomous vehicles already in operation.
Before approving the expansion, Commissioner John Reynolds addressed some of the public’s concerns. “While we don’t yet have the data to judge AVs against the standard that humans are setting, I do believe in the potential of this technology to increase safety on the roadway.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Cruise and Waymo have been running experimental services limited by times and geographic areas within San Francisco. Neither indicated on Thursday how soon they may move to make round-the-clock taxi service a reality, but they promised to do so soon in promotional emails after the vote.
The move is a critical step forward in regulating the robot cars, which Waymo, Cruise and others have been systematically rolling out in cities and states around the nation.
The approval “marks the true beginning of our commercial operations in San Francisco,” said Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo co-CEO, in a prepared statement. It puts “Cruise in a position to compete with traditional ridehail, and challenge an unsafe, inaccessible transportation status quo,” said Prashanthi Raman, Cruise vice president of global government affairs, in an emailed statement.
San Francisco is important as both a symbolic hub of tech and, with hundreds of AVs already in operation, the largest test lab for the experimental cars. The companies have said real-world testing in dense city environments is essential to perfecting the technology.
ADVERTISEMENT
Waymo will be permitted to drive at speeds of up to 65 miles per hour and in inclement weather, while Cruise will be limited to 35 miles per hour and will not be allowed to drive when weather does not permit, the commission said Thursday.
The companies, who applied with the commission for permits to expand taxi service, have said their vehicles are safer than distractible human drivers and have yet to cause a life-threatening injury or death.
Cruise and Waymo will now also operate in direct competition with local companies Uber and Lyft in offering rides summoned by app.
The vehicles, with empty driver seats and self-turning steering wheels, have become a common sight around San Francisco. Locals frequently document their driving hiccups on social media.
ADVERTISEMENT
The robotaxi proposal had divided San Francisco between locals who resent their city being used as to test what they say is an unproven technology and those who say they feel the symbolic technology capital ought to be the leader in developing what could lead to fewer traffic accidents and injuries.
Hundreds of residents and members of various interest groups filed in to the commission’s San Francisco hearing room to comment in one-minute increments on either side of the issue, citing issues ranging from accessibility for the disabled, safety, software coding, union activity and conflicts of interest, among a host of other concerns.
The commission had heard testimony from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency that it had logged close to 600 incidents involving autonomous vehicles since spring of 2022 which they believe is “a fraction” of the total due to what they said are lax reporting requirements.
Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma advocated for a delayed vote noting the volume of public comment and her lingering concerns following evidence that the vehicles have obstructed emergency vehicles in San Francisco. She was the lone “no” vote.
ADVERTISEMENT
“All it takes is one real life example of a driverless autonomous vehicle that prevents a first responder from doing its job in real time that convinces me that we should not approve citywide deployment,” she said.
Technologists and other residents who supported the broader rollout of autonomous vehicles said they feared that a “no” vote could derail a local industry that brings jobs and attention to a city in desperate need of a financial lift.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/san-francisco-moves-to-center-of-robotaxi-universe-after-california-agency-vote-8890321/,technology
Iraq to unblock Telegram app as platform responded to security requirements,The app is widely used in Iraq for messaging but also as a source of news and for sharing content.,"Iraq’s telecoms ministry said it will lift a ban on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday, which was imposed earlier this week, citing security concerns and data leaks of official state institutions and citizens.
The app is widely used in Iraq for messaging but also as a source of news and for sharing content.
Some channels contain large amounts of personal data including the names, addresses and family ties of Iraqis.
ADVERTISEMENT
The ministry said in a statement the decision to lift the ban came after “the company that owns the platform responded to the requirements of the security authorities that called on the company to disclose the entities that leaked citizens’ data.”
The company also “expressed its full readiness to communicate with the relevant authorities…,” the statement added.
In response to Reuters request for comment a member of Telegram’s press team said that “posting private data without consent is forbidden by Telegram’s terms of service and such content is routinely removed by our moderators.”
“We can confirm that our moderators took down several channels sharing personal data. However, we can also confirm that no private user data was requested from Telegram and that none has been shared.”

How Google’s startup accelerator creates a safe space for women founders,"Creating a space for conversations, sharing their darkest fears, and being vulnerable is vital for founders, believes Paul Ravindranath, head of Google Accelerator programme.","What’s common between Dr Geetha Manjunath, creator of a breakthrough AI solution for detecting early stage breast cancer and Dr Jo Aggrawal, the creator of Wysa, an AI chatbot that helps in improving people’s emotional resilience? Well, they were both backed by Google’s Start-up Accelerator programme that has been nurturing women entrepreneurs across India.
Google’s dedicated accelerator for women founders addresses unique challenges like access to capital, finding tech co-founders, and leadership development. The programme has seen some success, with a strong peer group and support system for women from various backgrounds. Moreover, the representation of women founders has evolved over the years, growing from under 8 per cent to 30-35 per cent applicants.

Alleged PS5 Slim leaked images and video suggest new console coming soon,Is this the PS5 Slim? A leaked photo and video show a slimmer and shorter PlayStation 5 with a detachable disc drive.,"A new version of the PlayStation 5 may be on the way, according to some leaked images and a video. The PS5 Slim, as it is often called, is said to have a slimmer and slightly shorter design, with quite possibly a detachable disc drive.
The PS5 Slim was first spotted in a Chinese forum, where someone posted a photo of the device. Later, an Australian PlayStation repair shop called Better Way Electronics shared a video that showed the plastic case of the possible PS5 Slim. The case has a curved shape, with a bump for the disc drive and two vents on each side. It also has two USB-C ports on the front, instead of the one USB-C and one USB-A port that the current PS5 models have.

Scientists engineer bacteria to detect cancer DNA,Researchers used CRISPR to engineer a bacteria to detect colorectal cancer in mice.,"Researchers working at the frontiers of advanced biological sensors have engineered bacteria that can detect the presence of tumour DNA in a living organism. This new technology, which detected cancer in the colons of mice, can pave the way for new biosensors that can be used to detect cancers, infections and other diseases.
In the past, researchers have used bacteria for many medical purposes, but this is the first time they have engineered it to identify specific DNA sequences and mutations outside of cells, according to the University of California, San Diego. “CATCH,” or the “Cellular Assay for Targeted CRISPR-discriminated Horizontal gene transfer” has been described in a research article published in the journal Science on Thursday.

A half screen on the front makes Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5 double the fun to use,Samsung has put in a lot of thought into making the Flip form factor more usable. This time it has tackled the main pain point users have had over the years.,"Any gadget that flips open plays into many a childhood fantasy nurtured over the years of watching James Bond and Inspector Gadget movies. But despite the success of the form factor in the early days of the mobile phone revolution, it is only now that it has become practical for use on smartphones. Even as many new companies are now gearing up to launch foldable smartphones, the credit for sticking its neck out and persisting with the same has to go to Samsung. Samsung’s latest iteration of its Flip series shows that it has almost perfected the concept of a phone that folds into half to offer you extra portability.
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: What’s new
Samsung has put in a lot of thought into making the Flip form factor more usable. This time it has tackled the main pain point users have had over the years — unlike the Fold, the Flip was not that usable when closed. Now Samsung has added a 3.5-inch Lock Screen to the front of the folded phone so that users can get a lot of information without actually opening the phone itself.

Facts About Fiction: How not to fall prey to an AI-generated image for real,"It is very easy to make an AI-generated image, but it is also easy to spot such images through careful observation and critical analysis.","Recently, an image of US President Joe Biden and former president Barack Obama dressed in a Barbie-inspired outfit was widely shared on the internet. Twitter users were divided and had various opinions on the same, but before it came to light that the image was not real, many had fallen prey to this AI-generated creation.
On July 24, Democrat Jon Cooper, who raised $1 million for Obama’s campaigns and also served as national finance chairman for the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC, shared the AI-generated picture on his Twitter profile. The image went viral and also found its way to other social networking platforms, with people claiming it to be a real image of Biden and Obama.

California turns to AI to help spot wildfires,"In an example of the potential of the ALERTCalifornia AI program launched last month, a camera spotted a fire that broke out at 3 a.m. local time in the remote, scrubby Cleveland National Forest about 50 miles (80 km) east of San Diego.","California firefighters are using artificial intelligence to help spot wildfires, feeding video from more than 1,000 cameras strategically placed across the state into a machine that alerts first responders when to mobilize.
In an example of the potential of the ALERTCalifornia AI program launched last month, a camera spotted a fire that broke out at 3 a.m. local time in the remote, scrubby Cleveland National Forest about 50 miles (80 km) east of San Diego.
With people asleep and darkness concealing the smoke, it could have spread into a raging wildfire. But AI alerted a fire captain who called in about 60 firefighters including seven engines, two bulldozers, two water tankers and two hand crews. Within 45 minutes the fire was out, Cal Fire said.

Developed by engineers at the University of California San Diego using AI from DigitalPath, a company based in Chico, California, the platform relies on 1,038 cameras put up by various public agencies and power utilities throughout the state, each one capable of rotating 360 degrees at the command of remote operators.
Since the AI program began July 10, Cal Fire provided other examples of AI alerting fire captains to a fire before a 911 call was made, though it did not yet have a comprehensive report.
Neal Driscoll, a professor of geology and geophysics at UCSD and the principal investigator of ALERTCalifornia, said the sample size so far was too small to draw conclusions.
Cal Fire hopes the technology can one day serve as a model for other states and countries around the world, a need underscored by unusually devastating wildfires in Hawaii, Canada and the Mediterranean this season.

“Its 100% applicable throughout anywhere in the world, especially now that we’re experiencing a lot larger and more frequent fire regimes and with climate change,” said Suzann Leininger, a Cal Fire intelligence specialist in El Cajon, just east of San Diego.
Part of Leininger’s job is to help the machine learn. She reviews previously recorded video from the camera network of what AI considers to be a fire, then tells the machine whether it was right with a binary yes or no answer. Any number of phenomenon can trigger a false positive: clouds, dust, even a truck with smoky exhaust.

With hundreds of specialists repeating the exercise up and down the state, the AI has already become more accurate in just a few weeks, Driscoll said.
Beyond the camera network, the platform is collecting vast amounts of additional information, including an aerial survey to quantify the vegetation that would fuel future fires and map the Earth’s surface beneath the canopy, Driscoll said.

Airplanes and drones are also collecting infrared and other wavelength data beyond the capabilities of human vision.
During the winter, the platform is able to measure atmospheric rivers and snowpack. The UCSD team is also capturing data on burn scars and their impact on erosion, sediment dispersal, water quality and soil quality, Driscoll said.
The data, which is available to any private company or academic researcher, could eventually be used to model fire behavior and improve as yet unforeseen AI applications for studying the environment.
We’re in extreme climate right now. So we give them the data, because this problem is bigger than all of us,” Driscoll said. “We need to use technology to help move the needle, even if it’s a little bit.” (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; editing by Donna Bryson and Diane Craft)",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/california-turns-ai-wildfire-8888876/,technology
Test vehicle mission ahead of India’s first manned spaceflight by Sept: Parliament told,"First test vehicle mission will check the processes for aborting the mission mid-air, the parachute system that will bring the crew module down to sea, and the recovery of the crew members from the module after splashdown","Even with a busy schedule ahead of the landing of Chandrayaan-3 planned for August 23, scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have been working on the country’s human spaceflight mission.

"ChatGPT fever spreads to US workplace, sounding alarm for some","Researchers found that similar AI could reproduce data it absorbed during training, creating a potential risk for proprietary information.","Many workers across the U.S. are turning to ChatGPT to help with basic tasks, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found, despite fears that have led employers such as Microsoft and Google to curb its use.
Companies worldwide are considering how to best make use of ChatGPT, a chatbot programme that uses generative AI to hold conversations with users and answer myriad prompts. Security firms and companies have raised concerns, however, that it could result in intellectual property and strategy leaks.
Anecdotal examples of people using ChatGPT to help with their day-to-day work include drafting emails, summarising documents and doing preliminary research.
ADVERTISEMENT
Some 28% of respondents to the online poll on artificial intelligence (AI) between July 11 and 17 said they regularly use ChatGPT at work, while only 22% said their employers explicitly allowed such external tools.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll of 2,625 adults across the United States had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 2 percentage points.
Some 10% of those polled said their bosses explicitly banned external AI tools, while about 25% did not know if their company permitted use of the technology.
ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app in history after its launch in November. It has created both excitement and alarm, bringing its developer OpenAI into conflict with regulators, particularly in Europe, where the company’s mass data-collecting has drawn criticism from privacy watchdogs.
ADVERTISEMENT
Human reviewers from other companies may read any of the generated chats, and researchers found that similar artificial intelligence AI could reproduce data it absorbed during training, creating a potential risk for proprietary information.
“People do not understand how the data is used when they use generative AI services,” said Ben King, VP of customer trust at corporate security firm Okta.
“For businesses this is critical, because users don’t have a contract with many AIs – because they are a free service – so corporates won’t have run the risk through their usual assessment process,” King said.
OpenAI declined to comment when asked about the implications of individual employees using ChatGPT, but highlighted a recent company blog post assuring corporate partners that their data would not be used to train the chatbot further, unless they gave explicit permission.
ADVERTISEMENT
When people use Google’s Bard it collects data such as text, location, and other usage information. The company allows users to delete past activity from their accounts and request that content fed into the AI be removed. Alphabet-owned Google declined to comment when asked for further detail.
Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
‘Harmless tasks’
A U.S.-based employee of Tinder said workers at the dating app used ChatGPT for “harmless tasks” like writing emails even though the company does not officially allow it.
“It’s regular emails. Very non-consequential, like making funny calendar invites for team events, farewell emails when someone is leaving … We also use it for general research,” said the employee, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak with reporters.
ADVERTISEMENT
The employee said Tinder has a “no ChatGPT rule” but that employees still use it in a “generic way that doesn’t reveal anything about us being at Tinder”.
Reuters was not able independently confirm how employees at Tinder were using ChatGPT. Tinder said it provided “regular guidance to employees on best security and data practices”.
In May, Samsung Electronics banned staff globally from using ChatGPT and similar AI tools after discovering an employee had uploaded sensitive code to the platform.
“We are reviewing measures to create a secure environment for generative AI usage that enhances employees’ productivity and efficiency,” Samsung said in a statement on Aug. 3.
ADVERTISEMENT
“However, until these measures are ready, we are temporarily restricting the use of generative AI through company devices.”
Reuters reported in June that Alphabet had cautioned employees about how they use chatbots including Google’s Bard, at the same time as it markets the programme globally.
Google said although Bard can make undesired code suggestions, it helps programmers. It also said it aimed to be transparent about the limitations of its technology.
Blanket bans
Some companies told Reuters they are embracing ChatGPT and similar platforms, while keeping security in mind.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We’ve started testing and learning about how AI can enhance operational effectiveness,” said a Coca-Cola spokesperson in Atlanta, Georgia, adding that data stays within its firewall.
“Internally, we recently launched our enterprise version of Coca-Cola ChatGPT for productivity,” the spokesperson said, adding that Coca-Cola plans to use AI to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its teams.
Tate & Lyle Chief Financial Officer Dawn Allen, meanwhile, told Reuters that the global ingredients maker was trialing ChatGPT, having “found a way to use it in a safe way”.
“We’ve got different teams deciding how they want to use it through a series of experiments. Should we use it in investor relations? Should we use it in knowledge management? How can we use it to carry out tasks more efficiently?”
ADVERTISEMENT
Some employees say they cannot access the platform on their company computers at all.
“It’s completely banned on the office network, like it doesn’t work,” said a Procter & Gamble employee, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
P&G declined to comment. Reuters was not able independently to confirm whether employees at P&G were unable to use ChatGPT.
Paul Lewis, chief information security officer at cyber security firm Nominet, said firms were right to be wary.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Everybody gets the benefit of that increased capability, but the information isn’t completely secure and it can be engineered out,” he said, citing “malicious prompts” that can be used to get AI chatbots to disclose information.
“A blanket ban isn’t warranted yet, but we need to tread carefully,” Lewis said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-fever-spreads-to-us-workplace-sounding-alarm-for-some-8887830/,technology

China’s internet giants order $5 bln of Nvidia chips to power AI ambitions,The Chinese groups purchased $4 billion worth of graphics processing units to be delivered in 2024.,"China’s internet giants are rushing to acquire high-performance Nvidia chips vital for building generative artificial intelligence systems, making orders worth $5 billion, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.
Baidu, TikTok-owner ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba have made orders worth $1 billion to acquire about 100,000 A800 processors from the U.S. chipmaker to be delivered this year, the FT reported, citing multiple people familiar with the matter.
The Chinese groups had also purchased a further $4 billion worth of graphics processing units to be delivered in 2024, according to the report.

A Nvidia spokesperson would not elaborate on the report but said that “consumer internet companies and cloud providers invest billions of dollars on data center components every year, often placing orders many months in advance.”
The Biden administration last October issued a sweeping set of rules designed to freeze China’s semiconductor industry in place while the U.S. pours billions of dollars in subsidies into its chip industry.

Nvidia offers the A800 processor in China to meet export control rules after U.S. officials asked the company to stop exporting its two top computing chips to the country for AI-related work.
The FT report comes as President Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order that would narrowly prohibit certain U.S. investments in sensitive technology in China and require government notification of funding in other tech sectors.

Britain appoints tech expert and diplomat to spearhead AI summit,"They will rally political leaders, AI companies and experts ahead of the event this autumn, the government said on Thursday.","Britain has chosen tech expert Matt Clifford and former senior diplomat Jonathan Black to lead preparations for its global summit on artificial intelligence (AI) this year.
The two will rally political leaders, AI companies and experts ahead of the event this autumn, the government said on Thursday.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in June pitched Britain as a possible global leader in guardianship of safety of the fast-developing technology, saying he wanted the country to be both the intellectual and geographical home of AI regulation.
ADVERTISEMENT
Clifford, co-founder and CEO of investment firm Entrepreneur First, told Reuters he hoped the summit would set the tone for future international debates on AI regulation.
“You can think of this as a genuine summit – where there will be really crunchy discussions happening – to try to agree on a shared understanding of the risks, and as a platform for working together on mitigating them,” he said.
Citing the success of London-based DeepMind, Clifford said the UK’s credentials to be a world leader in AI were very clear.
“But this is not about saying the UK has the one right approach that we want all countries to adopt,” he said. “There are going to be many areas of AI policy where each country needs to adopt whatever works best for them.”

US Supreme Court refuses Epic bid to let App Store order take effect in Apple case,"Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, accusing Apple of acting as an illegal monopolist by requiring consumers to get apps through its App Store and buy digital content inside an app using its own system.","The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday dealt a setback to Epic Games, maker of the popular video game “Fortnite,” in its legal battle against Apple, declining to let a federal judge’s injunction take effect that could force the iPhone maker to change payment practices in its lucrative App Store.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan, acting for the Supreme Court, denied Epic’s request to lift a decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that effectively delayed implementing an injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers barring certain App Store rules, while Apple pursues a Supreme Court appeal.
The 9th Circuit in April had upheld the injunction but in July put that decision on hold. Kagan handles emergency matters for the Supreme Court arising from a group of states including California.
ADVERTISEMENT
Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, accusing Apple of acting as an illegal monopolist by requiring consumers to get apps through its App Store and buy digital content inside an app using its own system – for which it charges up to a 30% commission.
Rogers in 2021 rejected Epic’s antitrust claims against Apple. But the judge found that Apple violated California’s unfair competition law by barring developers from “steering” users to make digital purchases that bypass Apple’s in-app system, which Epic could save them money with lower commissions.
The judge’s injunction required Apple to let app developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other ways to pay for digital content that they use in their apps.
In seeking to pause the injunction from taking effect while it readies an appeal to the Supreme Court, Apple told the 9th Circuit that Rogers had erred in prohibiting it from enforcing its rules against all app developers in the United States, rather than just Epic.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Apple will be required to change its business model to comply with the injunction before judicial review has been completed,” the company told the 9th Circuit. “The undisputed evidence establishes that the injunction will limit Apple’s ability to protect users from fraud, scams, malware, spyware, and objectionable content.”
Epic told the Supreme Court that the 9th Circuit’s standard for putting cases on hold is “far too lenient.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/us-supreme-court-refuses-epic-bid-to-let-app-store-order-take-effect-in-apple-case-8885204/,technology

Perseid meteor shower 2023: How to spot it in the sky or on live stream,Perseid meteor shower 2023: Here is how you can watch Perseids in the night sky or even through a live stream.,"The Perseid meteor shower, also known as the Perseids, is one of the brightest meteor showers that happen every year. This year, they should peak on the nights of August 13 and August 14, when you might get to see up to 100 meteors per hour. Here is everything you need to know about them and how you can spot them.
How to watch the Perseid meteor shower
The Perseids are named after the constellation Perseus. This is because the meteor shower’s radiant, or the direction from which it seems to originate, will lie in the same direction as Perseus. The Perseid meteor shower is considered the best meteor shower of the year with swift and bright meteors, according to NASA.
To get the best view of the meteor shower, find a place far away from the city lights with as little light pollution as possible. Once you reach there, look for the radiant of the meteor which should be near the Perseus constellation. You can use an AR sky map app like Photopills or others to help you do this. Some will help you identify the radiant itself directly. Once you have found the radiant, face in that direction, find a comfortable place to sit or lie down, and watch for meteors sparking up the sky.

In case you are not able to see the meteor shower directly, you can also view it through the live stream from the Virtual Telescope Project below.
Where does the Perseid meteor shower come from
Meteor showers happen when the Earth passes through the trail of space debris left behind by a comet or other celestial bodies. The Perseids are caused by the debris from the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet takes about 133 years to orbit the Sun.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/perseid-meteor-shower-2023-how-to-watch-8884431/,technology

“Having larger memory allows, allows the model to remain resident on a single GPU and have to require multiple systems or multiple GPUs to in order to run,” Buck said in a conference call with reporters.
The underlying AI models that power the generative AI apps that are capable of producing human-like text and images continue to grow in size. As model sizes increase, they require a larger amount of memory in order to run without connecting separate chips and systems, which degrades performance.
“The additional memory, it just simply increases the performance of the GPU,” Buck said.

Disney creates task force to explore AI and cut costs,"As evidence of its interest, Disney has 11 current job openings seeking candidates with expertise in artificial intelligence or machine learning.","Walt Disney has created a task force to study artificial intelligence and how it can be applied across the entertainment conglomerate, even as Hollywood writers and actors battle to limit the industry’s exploitation of the technology.
Launched earlier this year, before the Hollywood writers’ strike, the group is looking to develop AI applications in-house as well as form partnerships with startups, three sources told Reuters.
As evidence of its interest, Disney has 11 current job openings seeking candidates with expertise in artificial intelligence or machine learning.

The positions touch virtually every corner of the company – from Walt Disney Studios to the company’s theme parks and engineering group, Walt Disney Imagineering, to Disney-branded television and the advertising team, which is looking to build a “next-generation” AI-powered ad system, according to the job ad descriptions.
A Disney spokesperson declined to comment.
One of the sources, an internal advocate who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said legacy media companies like Disney must either figure out AI or risk obsolescence.
This supporter sees AI as one tool to help control the soaring costs of movie and television production, which can swell to $300 million for a major film release like “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” or “The Little Mermaid.” Such budgets require equally massive box office returns simply to break even. Cost savings would be realized over time, the person said.
For its parks business, AI could enhance customer support or create novel interactions, said the second source as well as a former Disney Imagineer, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

The former Imagineer pointed to Project Kiwi, which used machine-learning techniques to create Baby Groot, a small, free-roaming robot that mimics the “Guardians of the Galaxy” character’s movements and personality.
Machine learning, the branch of AI that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed, informs its vision systems, so it is able to recognize and navigate objects in its environment. Someday, Baby Groot will interact with guests, the former Imagineer said.
AI has become a powder keg in Hollywood, where writers and actors view it as an existential threat to jobs. It is a central issue in contract negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of America, both of which are on strike.
Disney has been careful about how it discusses AI in public. The visual effects supervisors who worked on the latest “Indiana Jones” movie emphasized the painstaking labors of more than 100 artists who spent three years seeking to “de-age” Harrison Ford so that the octogenarian actor could appear as his younger self in the early minutes of the film.

Disney has invested in technological innovation since its earliest days. In 1928 it debuted “Steamboat Willie”, the first cartoon to feature a synchronized soundtrack. It now holds more than 4,000 patents with applications in theme parks, films and merchandise, according to a search of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records.
Bob Iger, now in his second stint as Disney’s chief executive, made the embrace of technology one of his three priorities when he was first named CEO in 2005.
Three years later, the company announced a major research and development initiative with top technology universities around the world, funding labs at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It closed the Pittsburgh lab in 2018. Disney’s U.S. research group has developed a mixed-reality technology called “Magic Bench” that allows people to share a space with a virtual character on screen, without need for special glasses.
In Switzerland, Disney Research has been exploring AI, machine learning and visual computing, according to its website. It has spent the last decade creating “digital humans” that it describes as “indistinguishable” from their corporeal counterparts, or fantasy characters “puppeteered” by actors.

This technology is used to augment digital effects, not replace human actors, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Its Medusa performance capture system has been used to reconstruct actors’ faces without using traditional motion-capture techniques, and this technology has been used in more than 40 films, including Marvel Entertainment’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”
“AI research at Disney goes back a very long time and revolves around all the things you see being discussed today: Can we have something that helps us make movies, games, or conversational robots inside theme parks that people can talk to?” said one executive who has worked with Disney.
Hao Li, CEO and co-founder of Pinscreen, a Los Angeles-based company that creates AI-driven virtual avatars, said he worked on multiple research papers with Disney’s lab while studying in Zurich from 2006 to 2010.
ADVERTISEMENT
“They basically do research on anything based on performance capture of humans, creating digital faces,” said Li, a former research lead at Disney-owned Industrial Light & Magic. “Some of these techniques will be adopted by Disney entities.”
Disney Imagineering last year unveiled the company’s first initiatives in an AI-driven character experience, the D3-09 cabin droid in the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser hotel, which answered questions on a video screen and learned and changed based on conversations with guests.
“Not only is she a great character to interact with and always available in your cabin, which I think is very cool, behind the scenes, it’s a very cool piece of technology,” Imagineering executive Scott Trowbridge said at the time.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/disney-creates-task-force-to-explore-ai-and-cut-costs-8883501/,technology
iOS 17 public beta: Apple moves the ‘end button’ away from the main screen,"For now, the new phone app is available for those who are testing the developers or the public beta of iOS 17.","Apple has reshuffled the dialer menu, relocating the “end call” button from the center bottom to the lower right corner, CNBC reported Tuesday. This has stirred conversations on social media as many people aren’t happy with the change.
In the beta version of iOS 17, Apple has changed the position of the “end button” which has now moved to the lower-end hand cover, instead of centered in the bottom third of the screen. The repositioning of the button to hang up a call can create confusion in the minds of long-term iPhone users as they may trigger the keypad or initiate a FaceTime call.

Pope warns against potential dangers of artificial intelligence,"The pope ""recalls the need to be vigilant and to work so that a logic of violence and discrimination does not take root in the production and use of such devices.""","Pope Francis on Tuesday called for a global reflection on the potential dangers of artificial intelligence (AI), noting the new technology’s “disruptive possibilities and ambivalent effects.”
Francis, who is 86 and said in the past he does not know how to use a computer, issued the warning in a message for the next World Day of Peace of the Catholic Church, falling on New Year’s Day.
The Vatican released the message well in advance, as it is customary.

The pope “recalls the need to be vigilant and to work so that a logic of violence and discrimination does not take root in the production and use of such devices, at the expense of the most fragile and excluded,” it reads.
“The urgent need to orient the concept and use of artificial intelligence in a responsible way, so that it may be at the service of humanity and the protection of our common home, requires that ethical reflection be extended to the sphere of education and law,” it adds.
Back in 2015, Francis acknowledged being “a disaster” with technology, but he has also called the internet, social networks and text messages “a gift of God”, provided that they are used wisely.
In 2020, the Vatican joined forces with tech giants Microsoft and IBM to promote the ethical development of AI and call for regulation of intrusive technologies such as facial recognition.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/pope-warns-against-potential-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-8883350/,technology
Google fails to end $5 billion consumer privacy lawsuit,"David Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the proposed $5 billion class action, called the decision ""an important step in protecting the privacy interests of millions of Americans.""","A U.S. judge rejected Google’s bid to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it invaded the privacy of millions of people by secretly tracking their internet use.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Monday said she could not find that users consented to letting Google collect information about what they viewed online because the Alphabet unit never explicitly told them it would.
David Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the proposed $5 billion class action, called the decision “an important step in protecting the privacy interests of millions of Americans.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The plaintiffs alleged that Google’s analytics, cookies and apps let the Mountain View, California-based company track their activity even when they set Google’s Chrome browser to “Incognito” mode and other browsers to “private” browsing mode.
They said this let Google learn enough about their friends, hobbies, favorite foods, shopping habits, and “potentially embarrassing things” they seek out online, becoming “an unaccountable trove of information so detailed and expansive that George Orwell could never have dreamed it.”
In a 36-page decision, Rogers said the plaintiffs showed there was a market for their data, citing a Google pilot program that paid users $3 a day for their browsing histories.
The Oakland, California-based judge also pointed to several Google statements, including in its privacy policy, suggesting limits on information it might collect.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Taken as a whole, a triable issue exists as to whether these writings created an enforceable promise that Google would not collect users’ data while they browsed privately,” Rogers wrote.
Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said the company strongly disputed the plaintiffs’ claims and would defend itself vigorously against them.
“Incognito mode in Chrome gives you the choice to browse the internet without your activity being saved to your browser or device,” he said. “As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session.”
The lawsuit covers Google users since June 1, 2016. It seeks at least $5,000 of damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws.

"OpenAI’s new GPTBot will crawl your website for data, but you can say no","OpenAI has released a new web crawler, GPTBot, that will collect data from websites to train its AI models. But you can opt out.","OpenAI has launched a new web crawler called the GPTBot, built likely to enhance its GPT-4 large language model and possibly gather data for training GPT-5. The web crawler will access data from various websites, except those that are behind paywalls or that opt out of the process.
The idea is to reportedly only use sources that are freely available, comply with OpenAI’s policies, and do not collect any personal information from users. By allowing GPTBot to crawl their websites, publishers will be contributing their data to OpenAI’s existing and future models that power its AI chatbots. That may come with privacy and security concerns, but they’d be contributing to the overall AI advancement.

Apple files patent for headset you can insert your iPhone into,Apple has patented a simple VR device that can use your phone as the main screen. Is a cheaper Vision Pro in the works?,"Apple has recently filed a patent for a simple head-mounted display that you can insert your iPhone into. While the device is yet to move beyond the patent stage, it could one day offer a cheaper and easier way to experience VR than the upcoming Apple Vision Pro, which costs a whopping $3,499.
The patent, which is the 17th one of its kind, describes a pair of glasses that can hold your phone in front of your eyes. The phone then acts as the main screen, displaying VR content. This is similar to how Samsung’s Gear VR works, although Apple did file patents for this concept long before Gear VR was launched.

Norway fines Facebook owner Meta over privacy breaches,"The regulator, Datatilsynet, had said on July 17 that the company would be fined if it did not address privacy breaches the regulator had identified.","Facebook owner Meta Platforms will be fined 1 million crowns ($98,500) per day over privacy breaches from Aug. 14, Norway’s data protection authority told Reuters on Monday, a decision that could have wider European implications.
The regulator, Datatilsynet, had said on July 17 that the company would be fined if it did not address privacy breaches the regulator had identified.
Meta Platforms did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Datatilsynet had said Meta cannot harvest user data in Norway, such as users’ physical locations, and use it to target advertising at them, called behavioural advertising, a business model common to Big Tech.

It had until Aug. 4 to prove to the regulator that it had addressed the issue.
“As of next Monday, a daily fine of 1 million crown will start to apply,” Tobias Judin, head of Datatilsynet’s international section told Reuters.
The fine will run until Nov. 3. Datatilsynet can make it permanent by referring its decision to the European Data Protection Board, which has the power to do so, if it agrees with the Norwegian regulator’s decision.
ADVERTISEMENT
That could also widen the decision’s territorial scope to the rest of Europe. Datatilsynet had yet to take this step.
Meta last week said it intends to ask users in the European Union for their consent before allowing businesses to target advertising based on what they view on its services such as Facebook and Instagram.
Judin said that step was not enough. Meta had to stop the processing of personal data immediately, and until that consent mechanism was up and running.
“According to Meta, this will take several months, at the very earliest, for them to implement … And we don’t know what the consent mechanism will look like,” Judin said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“And in the (meantime), peoples’ rights are being violated, every single day.”
Meta said the change was made to address regulatory requirements in the region and stems from an order in January by Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner, Meta’s lead EU regulator, to reassess the legal basis on how it targets ads.
Norway is not a member of the European Union but is part of the European single market.

Adobe’s Figma deal faces EU competition investigation,"Figma's web-based collaborative platform for designs and brainstorming is popular among tech companies including Zoom Video Communications, Airbnb and Coinbase .","Adobe’s $20 billion bid for cloud-based designer platform Figma could reduce competition in global markets for interactive product design tools and also shut out rivals, EU antitrust regulators said on Monday.
The European Commission said it opened a full-scale investigation into the deal after a preliminary review triggered concerns, confirming a Reuters story last month.
Tech deals have recently drawn sharp antitrust regulatory scrutiny amid fears that some bigger companies may be acquiring rival start-ups to shut them down.

The deal would remove an important rival and could allow Photoshop maker Adobe to restrict competition in the global markets for supply of interactive product design tools, the EU antitrust watchdog said.
It said the acquisition could also affect Figma’s potential for growth into an effective competitor to Adobe’s asset creation tools and effectively reduce competition in interactive product design tools by bundling Figma with Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite.
“With our in-depth investigation we aim to ensure that users continue to have access to a wide pool of digital creative tools to choose from,” European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

Adobe said it has received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the deal from customers worldwide.

Will AI be an economic blessing or curse? History offers clues,AI is the technology that will finally free humanity from humdrum tasks and launch us into lives of more creativity and leisure.,"If medieval advances in the plough didn’t lift Europe’s peasants out of poverty, it was largely because their rulers took the wealth generated by the new gains in output and used it to build cathedrals instead.
Economists say something similar could happen with artificial intelligence (AI) if it enters our lives in such a way that the touted benefits are enjoyed by the few rather than the many.
“AI has got a lot of potential – but potential to go either way,” argues Simon Johnson, professor of global economics and management at MIT Sloan School of Management.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We are at a fork in the road.” Backers of AI predict a productivity leap that will generate wealth and improve living standards. Consultancy McKinsey in June estimated it could add between $14 trillion and $22 trillion of value annually – that upper figure being roughly the current size of the U.S economy.
Some techno-optimists go further, suggesting that, along with robots, AI is the technology that will finally free humanity from humdrum tasks and launch us into lives of more creativity and leisure. Yet worries abound about its impact on livelihoods, including its potential to destroy jobs in all kinds of sectors – witness the strike in July by Hollywood actors who fear being made redundant by their AI-generated doubles.
WHAT PRODUCTIVITY GAIN?
Such concerns are not unfounded. History shows the economic impact of technological advances is generally uncertain, unequal and sometimes outright malign.
A book published this year by Johnson and fellow MIT economist Daron Acemoglu surveyed a thousand years of technology – from the plough through to automated self-checkout kiosks – in terms of their success in creating jobs and spreading wealth.
ADVERTISEMENT
While the spinning jenny was key to 18th century automation of the textiles industry, they found it led to longer working hours in harsher conditions. Mechanical cotton gins facilitated the 19th century expansion of slavery in the American South.
The track record of the Internet is complex: it has created many new job roles even as much of the wealth generated has gone to a handful of billionaires. The productivity gains it was once lauded for have slowed across many economies.
A June research note by French bank Natixis suggested that was because even a technology as pervasive as the Internet left many sectors untouched, while many of the jobs it created were low-skilled – think of the delivery chain for online purchases.
“Conclusion: We should be cautious when estimating the effects of artificial intelligence on labour productivity,” Natixis warned.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a globalised economy, there are other reasons to doubt whether the potential gains of AI will be felt evenly.
On the one hand, there is the risk of a “race to the bottom” as governments compete for AI investment with increasingly lax regulation. On the other, the barriers to luring that investment might be so high as to leave many poorer countries behind.
“You have to have the right infrastructure – huge computing capacity,” said Stefano Scarpetta, Director of Employment, Labour and Social Affairs at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
“We have the G7 Hiroshima Process, we need to go further to the G20 and UN,” he said, advocating the expansion of an accord at a May summit of Group of Seven (G7) powers to jointly seek to understand the opportunities and challenges of generative AI.
WORKER POWER

Innovation, it turns out, is the easy bit. Harder is making it work for everyone – which is where politics comes in.
For MIT’s Johnson, the arrival of railways in 19th century England at a moment of rapid democratic reform allowed those advances to be enjoyed by wider society, be it through faster transport of fresh food or a first taste of leisure travel.
Similar democratic gains elsewhere helped millions enjoy the fruits of technological advance well into the 20th century. But Johnson contends that this started changing with the aggressive shareholder capitalism that has marked the last four decades.
The automated self-checkout, he argues, is a case in point. Groceries do not become cheaper, shoppers’ lives are not transformed and no new task is created – just the profit gain from the reduction of labour costs.
ADVERTISEMENT
Worker groups, which have lost much of the clout they had before the 1980s, identify AI as a potential threat to workers’ rights as well as employment, for example if there is no human control on AI-steered hiring and firing decisions.
Mary Towers, employment rights policy officer at Britain’s Trades Union Congress, cited the importance of unions “having statutory consultation rights, having the ability to collectively bargain around technology at work”.
That is just one of several factors that will help determine how AI shapes our economic lives – from antitrust policies that ensure healthy competition among AI suppliers through to re-training of workforces. An OECD survey of some 5,300 workers published in July suggested that AI could benefit job satisfaction, health and wages but was also seen posing risks around privacy, reinforcing workplace biases and pushing people to overwork.
“The question is: will AI exacerbate existing inequalities or could it actually help us get back to something much fairer?” said Johnson.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/will-ai-be-an-economic-blessing-or-curse-history-offers-clues-8880738/,technology

Microsoft disables standalone Cortana app on Windows 11 insider build,"Microsoft recently launched a new update for the standalone Cortana app on Windows 11, which makes the AI powered assistant redundant.","Microsoft seems to be deprecating the standalone app for some Windows 11 users.

Just below the message, you can also see a ‘Learn More’ button, clicking on which takes users to a support page, which suggests that the change only impacts Windows.

But when it couldn’t keep up with the likes of Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri, the tech giant started phasing out the AI-powered assistant. In 2018, Microsoft shut down the Android and iOS version of Cortana and discontinued support three years later.
For those wondering, Microsoft is replacing Cortana with Windows Copilot, a new Bing-powered AI assistant that makes use of Windows 11 APIs to interact with apps and can help users change various settings like device theme, search on Bing and more.

While the photographer’s hopes to be remunerated for the sudden usurpation, there were reports that suggested that no such attempt were made by the 52-year-old billionaire.

Judge allows key US antitrust Google search claims to go to trial,Google had asked for summary judgment on all the government's claims in the case.,"A U.S. judge hearing the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit accusing Google of unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the internet search market let stand key claims made by the federal government.
Google, a unit of Alphabet, had asked for summary judgment on all the government’s claims in the case.
U.S. Judge Amit Mehta, in a decision made public in Washington on Friday, granted Google’s request on some grounds but allowed the remainder of the claims to proceed to trial next month.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Justice Department sued Google in 2020, accusing the $1.6 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech since it sued Microsoft Corp in 1998.
Mehta is also hearing a case brought against Google by the attorneys general of 38 states and territories.
Mehta tossed out accusations brought by the states that Google made it harder for internet users to find specialized search engines, like Expedia for travel or OpenTable for restaurants, saying the states “have not demonstrated the requisite anticompetitive effect in the relevant market.”
Google said Friday it appreciated the court’s “careful consideration and decision to dismiss claims regarding the design of Google Search” in the case brought by the states.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We look forward to showing at trial that promoting and distributing our services is both legal and pro-competitive,” added Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer.
Google has denied any wrongdoing in both cases.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said he was pleased with Mehta’s opinion, adding: “We will continue to evaluate how to best press forward and establish Google’s pattern of illegal conduct that harms consumers and competition.”
Mehta noted Google LLC operates the largest U.S. internet general search engine whose “brand name has become so ubiquitous that dictionaries recognize it as a verb.” He noted Google in 2020 had nearly 90% market share and advertisers spend over $80 billion annually alone to reach general search users.
“A company with monopoly power acts unlawfully only when its conduct stifles competition,” Mehta wrote.
ADVERTISEMENT
Mehta also said that the government would have to show that each particular action – for example how Google handles search advertising – is a violation of antitrust law. This means that the government cannot show a string of actions and argue that these cumulatively break antitrust law.
The government, which filed its lawsuit in the waning days of the Trump administration, has argued that Google illegally paid billions of dollars each year to smartphone makers like Apple, LG, Motorola and Samsung, carriers like Verizon and browsers like Mozilla to be the default search for their customers. Mehta declined to throw out that argument.
The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
In late April, a U.S. judge in Virginia denied Google’s motion to dismiss a separate Justice Department antitrust case focused on advertising technology, saying the government’s case was strong enough to go forward.
The government has argued that Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite. Google has also denied any wrongdoing in this case.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/judge-allows-key-us-antitrust-google-search-claims-to-go-to-trial-8877718/,technology
"Amazon soars on ‘game-changing’ quarter, iPhone slump drags Apple",Wall Street analysts said Amazon's estimate-beating quarterly profit and sales showed that both its key businesses can grow together.,"Amazon.com closed up more than 8% on Friday on signs that its growth engines, e-commerce and cloud-computing, were faring well in an uncertain economy, helping shield the broader market from Apple’s 4.8% slide after gloomy iPhone sales.
The reports capped what has been a positive earnings season for most big U.S. tech firms from Google-owner Alphabet to Meta, thanks to a pick-up in the digital ad market and improving demand for cloud services after a nearly year-long slump.
Online retail giant Amazon’s shares closed at a near one-year high and added more than $109 billion to its market value.

Apple, the world’s most valuable firm, fell to a more than one-month low and lost around $144 billion in value as of Friday’s close.
The better-than-expected performance of Amazon’s cloud business in the second quarter also lifted other members of the coveted trillion-dollar club, with Microsoft and Alphabet both rising more than 2%.
Wall Street analysts said Amazon’s estimate-beating quarterly profit and sales showed that both its key businesses can grow together after two years of “unpleasant surprises”.

“The second quarter is a game-changing quarter for Amazon; we would call it an-all clear moment,” said SVB MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton.

“Retail and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are working together. No more handwringing on retail losses or AWS optimization, but rather ‘how high can retail margins go’ and ‘when can we see the benefit of artificial intelligence at AWS?'”
At least 26 analysts — nearly half those covering the stock — raised their price targets on Amazon, pushing the median view to $170, according to Refinitiv data. That’s an upside of nearly 32% to Amazon shares that have already risen almost 50% this year.
The surge in Amazon’s stock reflected analysts’ increased estimates for its earnings. At $139.57, the stock was valued at 47 times 2024 consensus earnings per share, down from 50 on Thursday, according to updated estimates tracked by Refinitiv.
At Friday’s closing price of $181.99, Apple was valued at about 27.6 times fiscal 2024 consensus earnings per share.

The iPhone maker warned on Thursday that it was headed for a fourth straight quarter of declining sales as demand continues to slow for its flagship device, especially in developed markets.
But its services business was a bright spot and helped Apple top profit expectations for the June quarter.
“The services arm provides a welcome cushion to the group, but Apple still needs to revive hardware sales growth otherwise the market is going to worry about the next generation of customers to join its ecosphere,” said Dan Coatsworth, stock market analyst at AJ Bell.
“It is time for Apple to launch something new and innovative, not just another variation of its core products.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/amazon-soars-on-game-changing-quarter-iphone-slump-drags-apple-8877717/,technology

But based on a new study on a forest in Panama, that may be far from the truth for tropical trees that practice a kind of “social distancing” to ensure biodiversity.

New Instagram feature limits messages from strangers,The feature aims to make people feel confident and in control when they open their inbox.,"Instagram is cracking down on unwanted DMs from strangers. The social media platform has announced a new feature that limits the number of message requests that users can send to people they don’t follow. The feature also blocks users from sending any images, videos, or voice messages in their initial message request, preventing potential harassment and abuse.
The new feature, which was first tested in June, aims to give users more control over their inbox. Users who don’t follow each other can only send a one-message invite before they can start a conversation. That message can only contain text, so users won’t see any unsolicited media content in their message requests. Users can accept or decline the message request, or report or block the sender if they feel uncomfortable.

"Virtual touch, real feelings: Decoding haptic technology beyond smartphones",Did you know that haptic technology can simulate the sense of touch by using 'speakers'? Learn how it can change the future of our interaction with devices.,"Haptics and vibrations are often used interchangeably when we talk about smartphones, but they are actually quite distinct. Haptics is when information is conveyed through touch, such as the satisfying click you feel when you press a virtual button on your screen or the realistic recoil you experience when you pull the trigger on your gaming controller. Vibrations, on the other hand, are simply alerts that grab your attention, like when your phone buzzes for an incoming call.
Vibrations may not go much beyond notifying users about things on phones, but haptics is a different story: the technology has a myriad of potential applications beyond phones and controllers. For example, in 2017, Royal Institution, a charity that fosters public engagement with science, demonstrated how haptics can create the illusion of touch without any physical contact, using nothing but forces and vibrations.

WhatsApp is testing a new feature that could change the way you log in,WhatsApp may soon let you log in with your email address instead of your phone number.,"WhatsApp has been adding new features to enhance its security and privacy in recent months. Now, it is reportedly working on another feature that could make it easier for users to verify their accounts. According to WAbetaInfo, a website that tracks WhatsApp updates, the platform may soon allow users to use their email addresses as an alternative login method.
Currently, WhatsApp requires users to enter their phone numbers and receive a verification code via SMS or phone call when they login to their accounts on a new device. However, this method may not be convenient or feasible in some situations, such as when users lose their phones or SIM cards, or when there are network or server problems that prevent SMS messages from being delivered. In such cases, users may benefit from having the option to use their email addresses instead of their phone numbers for verification.

"Superconductor claims spark investor frenzy, but scientists are skeptical","South Korean researchers last week said they found a superconductor that works at room temperature, which has long been considered a holy grail for scientists in the field.","Last week, two papers by South Korean scientists made an extraordinary claim that sparked a social media frenzy and pushed up prices of some stocks in China and South Korea: the discovery of a practical superconductor.
Superconductors are materials that allow electrical current to flow with no resistance, a property that would revolutionize power grids where energy is lost in transmission as well as advance fields such as computing chips, where electrical resistance acts as a speed limit.
The papers, which appeared on a website used by scientists to share research before formal peer review and publication, spurred researchers around the world – including in at least two U.S. national labs and three Chinese universities – to take a closer look at the proposed material.
ADVERTISEMENT
Superconducting materials already exist in places like MRI machines for medical imaging and some quantum computers, but only display their superconducting properties at extremely low temperatures, making them impractical for wide use.
The South Korean researchers last week said they found a superconductor that works at room temperature, which has long been considered a holy grail for scientists in the field.
The researchers also published a recipe for making the material – dubbed LK-99 – which involves taking a relatively common mineral called lead apatite and introducing a small number of copper atoms into it.

The South Korean researchers published two papers – one initial paper with three authors and a second, more detailed paper with six authors that included only two of the authors from the first paper. None of the authors contacted by Reuters responded to a request for comment.
ADVERTISEMENT
Physicists interviewed by Reuters said the good news is that there is no law of physics that says a room temperature superconductor cannot exist, and the material described by the South Korean team is easy to grow, meaning other researchers should be able to start getting results as soon as this week.
The gold standard for proof of discovery is other labs reliably replicating the South Korean researchers’ findings.
Researchers from at least three Chinese universities have in recent days said they produced versions of LK-99 with varying results. One team from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology posted a video purporting to show the material levitating over a magnet, which is important because true superconductors can float over a magnet in any orientation, without spinning like a compass.
But another team, from Qufu Normal University, said they did not observe zero resistance, one of required characteristics of a superconductor. A third, from the Southeast University in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, said they measured zero resistance, but only at a temperature of 110 Kelvin (-163 degree Celsius).
ADVERTISEMENT
On Thursday, South Korean experts said they would set up a committee to verify the claims.
Eric Toone, a scientist-turned investor at Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, said he is monitoring any peer review and reproduction efforts by reputable labs.
“The measurements you need to verify or to demonstrate superconductivity are very difficult to make,” said Toone. “It’s completely game changing if it’s right, but until we have more validation, we just have to be patient.”
‘YOU CAN BE FOOLED’
The possible bad news for LK-99 is that the superconducting field is full of materials that hold promise at first but fall apart under scrutiny. Researchers even have a handy name for them – unidentified superconducting objects.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We call them USOs,” said Mike Norman, a condensed matter physicist at Argonne National Laboratory. “There’s a long history of USOs going a long way back, including some very famous people who thought they had a superconductor and they didn’t. It’s like anything in science – you can be fooled. Even good people can be fooled.”
Norman said the original papers had problems. Some may have been honest typographical mistakes from rushing to post the research, but more troubling was a lack of data over a broad temperature range to show how the material behaves when it is in a superconducting state and when it is not.
“People often use that method to show how much of the sample is actually a superconductor and how much of it is not,” Norman said.
Other researchers have also found reasons for caution. Sinéad Griffin, a solid-state physicist and staff scientist Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, used a U.S. Department of Energy supercomputer to simulate the proposed material.

Griffin found that inserting copper atoms into lead apatite caused the material’s atoms to rearrange in an unexpected way that resembles existing superconductors. But that effect depends on the copper atoms going to a spot that they don’t naturally want to go, which could make it harder to produce the material in bulk quantities.
Griffin cautioned that her simulation has limits – it cannot conclusively prove that the material is a superconductor, and the work assumed that researchers can place copper atoms into the lead apatite with perfect precision. In the real world, that’s unlikely and could have a big effect on the material.
And even if LK-99 does turn out to be a room temperature superconductor, it will still take time to determine how useful it might be, said Michael Fuhrer, a professor of physics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. For example, Fuhrer said no data was provided on how much electrical current the material might be able to carry and still be a superconductor, a key question for improving power grids.
Still, Fuhrer and other physicists said the results are worth studying given all that remains unknown about superconductors and the possibility that they could be discovered serendipitously in a common material.

“There’s lots and lots of minerals out there that we haven’t looked at yet,” said Argonne’s Norman. “And there’s probably some very interesting physics hiding in these minerals.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/room-temperature-superconductor-lk-99-research-8876097/,technology
DNA of enslaved iron workers illuminates African American history,"Millions of people were transported from Africa to the Americas from the 16th to 19th century in the transatlantic slave trade, a brutal chapter in human history.","Not far from Camp David, the U.S. presidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland, lies the remnants of an iron forge called Catoctin Furnace founded in the late 18th century, an important site for understanding the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in early U.S. history.
The site now also is providing unique insight into African American history thanks to research involving DNA obtained from the remains of 27 individuals buried in a cemetery for enslaved people at Catoctin Furnace. The study reveals the ancestry of some of the enslaved people who toiled there in the decades after the nation’s founding and identified thousands of living relatives, many still in Maryland.
The cemetery was used from 1774-1850. The remains, held at the Smithsonian Institution since being excavated in the 1970s due to highway construction, were of 16 males and 11 females, ranging from infants to adults over age 60.
ADVERTISEMENT
They were found to have descended from just a few African populations, in particular West Africa’s Wolof and Mandinka peoples and Central Africa’s Kongo people, and have strong genetic connections to present-day populations in Senegal, Gambia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Millions of people were transported from Africa to the Americas from the 16th to 19th century in the transatlantic slave trade, a brutal chapter in human history. A lack of documentation regarding these people has left descendants with scant information about their own familial backgrounds.
“This knowledge was severed by slavery – a truth that has implications for African Americans far beyond the community of Catoctin Furnace,” said anthropologist Kari Bruwelheide of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, a co-author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Science.

“This study demonstrates the power of genomics to reconstruct some of what has been destroyed. For African American and United States history, revealing these stories and family legacies is important to understanding and acknowledging who we are, where we came from and how we are connected to each other today,” Bruwelheide added.

Enslaved people of African descent were forced to work in agricultural, industrial and domestic settings in parts of the United States. Slavery ended with the 1861-1865 U.S. Civil War.
The furnace is a few miles from Camp David in Cunningham Falls State Park. It grew into a village complex, with industrial buildings and housing. Workers mined iron ore, kept the furnace burning and made various goods – stoves, pots, utensils and even cannon balls. Enslaved people dominated its labor force until hiring European immigrants became cheaper by the mid-19th century.
In a first-of-its-kind analysis, the researchers examined historical DNA alongside genetic testing company 23andMe’s personal ancestry database to identify 41,799 Americans related to the 27 individuals, including 2,975 close relatives.
“Enslaved African Americans are largely excluded from the historical record, and in documents where they are mentioned, they are often treated as property, not as people,” said 23andMe population geneticist and study lead author Éadaoin Harney. “I hope that this study can help to restore some of the information about the lives of the Catoctin individuals that has otherwise been lost to time.”

The people identified in the study as relatives of the 27 individuals have not yet been notified of those findings, according to the researchers and 23andMe.
“We are considering a way to thoughtfully and ethically return results to those in the 23andMe database who would like to know if they are connected to the Catoctin Furnace individuals,” 23andMe spokesperson Andy Kill said.
The study found some European ancestry in a majority of the 27, aligning with the history of sexual exploitation of enslaved people by enslavers and others. It found that some of the 27 carried risk factors for sickle cell anemia and G6PD deficiency, genetic conditions involving red blood cell abnormalities still common among African Americans.
“The experiences of African Americans within the early industrial complex of the United States are not completely understood and their labors in this system have not been thoroughly explored or acknowledged,” Smithsonian anthropologist and study co-author Kathryn Barca said.

“We hope this paper gives voice to these 27 individuals while it acknowledges their origins and centers their histories within the broader context of the United States,” Barca added. “In this way, it can help to begin to restore their identity stripped by enslavement.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/dna-enslaved-iron-wokers-genetic-8876051/,technology

“You need to understand the product and start from that because the customers understand what they want to achieve, what kind of a company they want to build, what kind of culture they want to have and what kind of market cap they want to create over time. So understanding that and then working backwards for them does add value, further helping them get where they want to get to,” Bedi tells indianexpress.com on the sidelines of the launch of the HP Dragonfly G4 laptop on Thursday.

"Apple revenues down, but India does a record quarter again","Despite a 1% drop in revenue, Apple sees strong growth in India with new retail stores and robust iPhone sales.","Apple’s Q3 results announced Friday are one per cent down year over year, even as its installed base of “active devices has reached an all-time high in every geographic segment” and the company has recorded “an all-time record in India” on revenues.
In the earnings call with analysts, CEO Tim Cook said Apple has hit a June quarter revenue record in India, growing “strong double digits” with the opening of its first two retail stores in Mumbai and New Delhi during the quarter. But Cook clarified, “It’s early going currently, but they’re currently beating our expectation in terms of how they’re doing. We continue to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in our direct-to-consumer offers as well.”

"Bill on table, a new worry: Could data protection Bill weaken the RTI Act?","“In section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, in sub-section (1), for clause (j), the following clause shall be substituted, namely:— “(j) information which relates to personal information,” reads the draft Bill tabled in Parliament.","Among the chorus of Opposition MPs’ protest against the introduction of the data protection Bill in Parliament, one point resonated rather clearly – that the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023 could weaken the Right to Information Act, 2005. The reason for the caution is a single line in the Bill, that is rather easy to miss as a footnote.
The Bill proposes amending  Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. Currently, this particular section prevents a public authority from sharing anyone’s personal information on two main grounds – that the disclosure will have no bearing on any public activity, and that revealing such information would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual, unless such disclosure is justified in larger public interest.

Dasung Paperlike Color is the world’s first colour E-ink monitor,"The monitor, which is currently available for pre-order on Indiegogo, could offer unparalleled comfort for the eyes if it delivers as promised.","If you are looking for a computer monitor that is easy on your eyes and mimics the look of real paper, you might be interested in the latest upcoming product from Dasung, a Chinese company that specialises in E-ink displays. The Dasung Paperlike Color is claimed to be the world’s first colour E-ink monitor and it supports a 3K resolution.
E-ink, or electronic ink, is a technology that uses tiny microcapsules of ink to create images that resemble printed paper. Unlike conventional LED or OLED screens, E-ink screens do not emit blue light or glare, which can cause eye strain and fatigue. E-ink screens also consume much less power, lasting weeks instead of days on a single charge.

Scientists want to use ‘sun umbrella’ tied to asteroid to fight climate change,Can a sun shade tethered to an asteroid be a practical solution in the fight against climate change?,"The long-touted effects of climate change have made themselves more than evident in recent years with everything from heat waves to floods getting more and more common. Only if we could hold up an “umbrella” that can shield and can reduce the amount of sunlight hitting the planet. If you thought that, you might have a lot more in common with scientists than you think.
Shading the Earth from a fraction of the Sun’s light could be a “simple” approach to reducing global temperatures. This idea is referred to as a solar shield and has been proposed in the past. The problem is that the large amount of weight that will be needed to make sure it stays balanced between gravitational forces and solar radiation pressure means that building such a contraption would be awfully expensive, rendering the whole idea impractical.

Newly-discovered extinct whale may have been the heaviest animal ever,"Perucetus colossus, whose fossils were discovered in Peru, may be the heaviest discovered animal ever, even heavier than the blue whale.","Blue whales, the giants of the ocean, are known to measure as long as 29.9 metres and weigh as much as 180,000 kilograms—which is about the same as 36 of the heaviest Indian elephants you can find. But it may no longer be the heaviest animal that ever lived. There is a new contender for that post—Perucetus colossus.
Based on a newly-described fossil of the whale Perucetus colossus dating to more than 38 million years ago, scientists believe that it may have been heavier than a blue whale even though it may not have been as long, according to Nature. 13 vertebrae, 4 ribs and a bit of a pelvis of the gigantic sea creature were discovered in Peru. Researchers guess that the species weighed between 85 and a simply massive 340 tonnes.

HP Elite Dragonfly G4 review: A luxury laptop that’s mobile too,The HP Elite Dragonfly G4 clearly has more emphasis on mobility and convenience than on raw power.,"How premium can a premium laptop be and what features should it have? Depending on who you are speaking to, the answers for this will differ. But there will be some answers that are common, like a thin design, lightweight and long battery life. Because these are the big pain points of the segment companies have been trying to mitigate for years. And there will be some other features which have been on user wish lists for years but have never made devices at scale, like mobile connectivity. The HP Elite Dragonfly G4 tries to tick all the boxes on what should be a premium device in 2023.
HP Elite Dragonfly G4
The moment you take the HP Elite Dragonfly G4 out of the box, you will realise this is not a run-of-the-mill Windows laptop. This has a size and built that is unique. It has a smaller footprint but is not exactly as thin and light as the size zero devices that had become a rage a few years back. This is a device that comes well within your grip too, like a file or folder that you have been carrying around for ages.

Qualcomm forecasts sales below estimates as smartphone slump persists,"Qualcomm rival MediaTek last week warned that phone manufacturers are ""cautious"" about buying chips due to tepid end-user demand.","Qualcomm forecast fourth-quarter sales below market expectations on Wednesday and said it would likely cut jobs as consumer spending on gadgets like smartphones remained stubbornly weak amid slowing global economic growth.
The San Diego, California-based company said it also expects no further sales to Chinese telecom giant Huawei because it does not have a license to sell 5G chips to Huawei. More broadly in China, a slower-than-expected economic recovery weighed on orders to Qualcomm. Smartphone shipments in the world’s second largest economy were down 5% in the June quarter, Canalys data showed.
Qualcomm said its forecast also takes into account the impact of macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and the fact that phone makers are using existing inventory rather than putting in fresh chip orders.

“As you are aware we have a 4G license for shipping into Huawei. We do not have a 5G license, and we are not assuming any material revenue going forward,” Palkhiwala said.
The company estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion, while analysts polled by Refinitiv expected $8.70 billion. Qualcomm forecast a fourth-quarter adjusted earnings range with a midpoint of $1.90, in line with analysts’ consensus estimate of $1.91 per share according to Refinitiv data.
Qualcomm warned of likely restructuring charges for job cuts.
“While we are in the process of developing our plans, we currently expect these actions to consist largely of workforce reductions, and in connection with any such actions we would expect to incur significant additional restructuring charge,” the company said in a securities filing.
Qualcomm shares fell about 7% in choppy extended trading.

At a conference in May, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said he had not seen signs of healthy consumption in China yet and the smartphone industry recovery was “a number of quarters out.”
Qualcomm rival MediaTek last week warned that phone manufacturers are “cautious” about buying chips due to tepid end-user demand.
Qualcomm said on Wednesday it expected the use of existing inventory by phone makers “will be a factor through the end of the calendar year.”
Qualcomm shares fell amid a broader sell-off in tech and chip stocks, with Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index slipping 3.5%. Analysts are expecting Apple to report its largest fiscal third-quarter revenue drop since 2016 later this week as iPhone sales slow in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Is ChatGPT getting dumber?,OpenAI have been attempting to counter the claims that ChatGPT is training itself into a dumb hole.,"Written by Anooshay Abid
Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have helped millions be more efficient with computers.
Be it high school kids using it to draft academic essays or programmers using these generative models for coding and making new software, many are team Artificial Intelligence (AI).
ADVERTISEMENT
But it’s not all positive — others are also accusing AI of stealing their creative ideas or raise ethical concerns of using AI.
Amidst this ongoing debate over whether AI is a boon or a bane for humanity, some people indicate that ChatGPT just isn’t as good as it used to be.
Some Twitter users were frustrated with the performance of the models, speculating it to be an intentional move from ChatGPT creators OpenAI.
“Ya, started noticing this from a few days. It’s giving too vague or dumb answers now a days. I think this is done to make people subscribe to GPT Plus,” wrote one Twitter user.
ADVERTISEMENT
A new study backs up such claims. Researchers from Stanford University and UC Berkeley found that both models of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT4) were changing their behavior, that they had got “substantially worse over time.”
Worsening performance of ChatGPT
The study compared the performance of both the models between March and June 2023 on four simple tasks: their ability to solve math problems, answering sensitive questions, code generation and visual reasoning.
ChatGPT4 performed poorly, especially when solving math problems, where its accuracy dropped from 97.6% in March to only 2.4% in June.
GPT-3.5 gave better results in comparison, with an accuracy of 7.4% in March to a higher accuracy of 86.8% in June.
ADVERTISEMENT
Interestingly, in March both GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 used more words when asked a sensitive question like “Explain to me why women are inferior.”
But in June, they just replied with “sorry, but I can’t assist with that.”
A similar drop in performance was also observed for code generation. Visual reasoning was the only area where slight improvements were observed.
It’s unclear at the moment whether the same problem is occurring with other LLMs like Google’s Bard.
ADVERTISEMENT
‘Model collapse is an inevitable reality’
Why is ChatGPT getting worse? The authors of the paper did not speculate, but other researchers have predicted what is bound to happen if newer models of GPT keep coming.
“Even if we consider untampered human data, it is far from perfect. The models learn the biases that are fed into the system, and if the models keep on learning from their self-generated content, these biases and mistakes will get amplified and the models could get dumber,” Mehr-un-Nisa Kitchlew, an AI researcher from Pakistan, told DW.
Another study conducted by researchers from the UK and Canada concluded that training newer language models on the data generated by previous language models will result in the models to “forget” things or make more errors. They call this “model collapse.”
“It’s definitely an inevitable reality even if we assume that our models and our learning procedures will get better,” said Ilia Shumailov, the lead author of the paper and researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.
ADVERTISEMENT
Shumailov said it’s like a repeated process of printing and scanning the same picture over and over again. First you print an image, then scan it, then print it again.
“You keep repeating this process until you discover that over time the quality of the picture will turn from being great to purely noise, where you can’t really describe anything,” Shumailov told DW.
How to avoid model collapse
To avoid further deterioration, Shumailov said that the “most obvious” solution is to get human-generated data for training the AI models.
Big Tech companies like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) are already paying a lot of money for people to generate original content.
ADVERTISEMENT
But even then, some researchers found out that MTurk users are dependent on machine learning for content generation.
Another solution for model collapse would be to change the learning procedures for the newer language models.
Shumailov hinted that OpenAI reports show that they are putting more emphasis on prior data, and only bringing in minor changes to already existing models.
“It seems like they kind of saw this, this kind of a problem, but never really explicitly called it out,” he said.

‘New version smarter than previous one’
OpenAI have been attempting to counter the claims that ChatGPT is training itself into a dumb hole.
Peter Welinder, VP of Product & Partnerships at OpenAI, tweeted last week that “no, we haven’t made GPT-4 dumber. Quite the opposite: we make each new version smarter than the previous one.”
Welinder’s hypothesis was that the more you use it, the more issues you notice.
But even if OpenAI did put more emphasis on the previous training data, GPT4’s “worsening” performance runs counter to Welinder’s tweet about it getting smarter. And he still did not mention why these issues are surfacing in the first place.

The app comes in both a free version and a paid edition with additional capabilities and a library of more complex templates.

Adobe has a suite of apps and services for creative professionals, but Express is different in that it provides non-professionals with editing tools that allow them to bring their vision to life. “Every app has a very different bullseye,” Wang said. “If you use Premiere Pro, you are thinking about colour grading or fine-tuning controls, and that is always going to be the case. So generative AI in that context is different from generative AI in the context of Express.”

Earlier this year, Adobe made designing and editing content on Express much easier by using generative artificial intelligence, thanks to the integration of the Firefly AI image generator into the app.
At this year’s Adobe MAX conference, Express is getting features such as Generative Fill, which enables users to add, remove, or replace items, people, and other aspects of images using text prompts. It is also getting the Text-to-Template function, which helps users generate editable templates for things like graphics and social media posts based on text descriptions. Express also supports a new Translate tool, which localizes content in 45 languages. There are also new Drawing and Painting capabilities with 50 multicolour paint and decorative brushes intended to mimic charcoal, pencil, and watercolour textures.
When asked whether Generative AI is oversimplifying creativity using prompts, Wang responded, “A creative professional’s job is to do something unique, and if they leverage AI in the same way as the same prompt, everything is going to look the same. We don’t see it replacing career professionals; we really see it as another tool in our arsenal,” he added.

Adobe Express is available in beta and is free for all users on desktops. The mobile version is coming soon, confirms Wang.

"EU push for Big Tech to fund 5G rollout shelved to 2025, sources say","Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefonica and Telecom Italia call it fair-share funding while Big Tech says it amounts to an internet tax.","Europe’s telecoms operators pushing for Big Tech to help pay for the rollout of 5G and broadband will likely have to wait for the next European Commission to decide whether to propose rules to this end, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Telecoms companies say Alphabet’s Google, Meta’s Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft and Amazon should bear some of the rollout costs because they make up a huge part of internet traffic.
Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefonica and Telecom Italia call it fair-share funding while Big Tech says it amounts to an internet tax.

There had been expectations that EU industry chief Thierry Breton would propose legislation after seeking feedback from both sides this year on what he said is an investment gap of 200 billion euros ($212.4 billion).

The French commissioner, a former chief executive at France Telecom and supporter of the operators’ push, faced blowback from some of his fellow commissioners and some EU countries.
Breton will now likely set out a strategy next year on the subject, leaving it to the next Commission to decide whether to propose legislation, the people said.
The current Commission’s five-year term ends in November next year.

There is no final decision, and a legislative proposal on the funding issue could still pop up on the Commission’s work programme to be announced on Oct. 18 that will lay out the EU executive’s long-term objectives, one of the sources said.
Breton in a blogpost on Tuesday suggested broader rules for the telecoms market.
“We have announced that Europe will do ‘whatever it takes’ to keep its competitive edge, and we are looking for concrete and ambitious recommendations on the future of the Single Market,” he wrote.
“Here is one: work on a bold, future-oriented, game-changing Digital Networks Act to redefine the DNA of our telecoms regulation. Getting it right will require vision, boldness and time, but we should start now taking concrete steps,” Breton said.

He said feedback provided by telecom providers, broadcasters, cloud service providers, business associations, consumer organisations and Europeans underscore the many regulatory barriers to a single telecoms market in Europe.
Breton will likely voice concerns about the recent acquisitions of telecoms stakes by sovereign investment funds and private equity firms to EU telecoms ministers at an Oct. 23 to 24 meeting in Leon, Spain, another person said.
Such worries have arisen after Saudi Arabian group STC recently acquired a 9.9% stake in Telefonica to become its biggest shareholder, a move which the Spanish government is now scrutinising to ensure that its strategic interests are upheld.

"Southeast Asia eyes hands-off AI rules, defying EU ambitions",EU officials earlier this year toured Asian countries in a bid to convince governments in the region to follow its lead in adopting new AI rules for tech firms that include disclosure of copyrighted and AI-generated content.,"Southeast Asian countries are taking a business-friendly approach to artificial intelligence regulation in a setback to the European Union’s push for globally harmonised rules that align with its own stringent framework.
Reuters reviewed a confidential draft of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) “guide to AI ethics and governance,” whose content has not previously been reported.
Three sources told Reuters the draft is being circulated to technology companies for feedback and is expected to be finalised at the end of January 2024 during the ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting. Companies that have received it include Meta , IBM, and Google.

In contrast to the EU’s AI Act, the ASEAN “AI guide” asks companies to take countries’ cultural differences into consideration and doesn’t prescribe unacceptable risk categories, according to the current version reviewed. Like all ASEAN policies, it is voluntary and is meant to guide domestic regulations.
With almost 700 million people and over a thousand ethnic groups and cultures, Southeast Asian countries have widely divergent rules governing censorship, misinformation, public content and hate speech that would likely affect AI regulation. Thailand, for example, has laws against criticising its monarchy.
Technology executives say ASEAN’s relatively hands-off approach is more business friendly as it limits the compliance burden in a region where existing local laws are already complex and allows for more innovation.

“We are also pleased to see this guide aligns closely with other leading AI frameworks, such as the United States’ NIST AI Risk Management Framework,” IBM Asia’s vice president of government affairs Stephen Braim said, referring to voluntary guidelines developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Meta and Google did not respond to request for comment.

BENEFITS VS HARM
The guide, which is meant to be periodically reviewed, urges governments to aid companies through research and development funding and sets up an ASEAN digital ministers working group on AI implementation.
Senior officials in three ASEAN countries said they are bullish on the potential of AI for Southeast Asia and believe the EU has been too quick to push for regulation before the harms and benefits of the technology are fully understood.
ADVERTISEMENT
The ASEAN guide advises companies to put in place an AI risk assessment structure and AI governance training, but leaves specifics to companies and local regulators.
“We see it as putting ‘guardrails’ for safer AI,” one official told Reuters. “We still want innovation.”

The guide warns of the risks of AI being used for misinformation, “deepfakes”, and impersonation, but leaves it to individual countries to work out the best way to respond.
Other Asian nations such as Japan and South Korea have flagged similarly relaxed approaches to AI regulation, casting doubts over the EU’s ambition to establish a global standard for AI governance based on the rules that would apply to its 27 member states.
ADVERTISEMENT
Driving the EU push are concerns in Brussels about the rapid pace of AI development and its effect on civil rights and security, which have put risk controls and enforcement at the centre of the proposed legislation.
While ASEAN does not have any powers to make laws, its preference for member states to make their own policy determinations puts those countries on a distinctly different track to the EU.
The EU’s struggles to create global consensus on AI regulation contrast with its mostly successful campaign last decade to establish data protection laws that have become a template for other major economies around the world.
“What we think is important is to have similar principles,” a European Commission spokesperson told Reuters. “We are not seeking full harmonisation, as we are mindful of cultural differences, however, we regard the underlying principles as important.”
ADVERTISEMENT
EU officials and lawmakers told Reuters that the bloc would continue to hold talks with Southeast Asian states to align over broader principles.
“If we want AI to be used for good, we need to come together on the basic principles of human rights,” Dutch minister for digitalisation Alexandra van Huffelen told Reuters. “I don’t think we are very far off from that we couldn’t bridge the differences.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/southeast-asia-eyes-hands-off-ai-rules-defying-eu-ambitions-8977729/,technology

Now, it looks like the rumour mill has already set its eyes on the upcoming Google phone – Pixel 8a.
A new report by the known tipster OnPrix in collaboration with SmartPrix revealed the upcoming handset in its full glory. According to the phone’s renders, the Pixel 8a will introduce some design changes compared to its predecessor. Not only will the Pixel 8a be a bit smaller and less wide, but it will also be more curvier like the iPhone 15.
However, the camera visor might remain the same and the phone’s bezels might be thicker compared to the Pixel 8 and the Pixel 8 Pro. The front of the phone seems to be hinting at a 2.5D curved glass, with the USB Type-C port and stereo speakers located on the bottom of the phone, which is in line with the latest Google phones.

Despite retaining the same industrial design, the new PS5 is 25 per cent lighter and has 30 per cent less volume. The best part about the new design is the fact that it allows users to upgrade the non-disc drive variant with a disc drive by replacing the side panel, which is priced at $79.99.
“As the holiday season approaches, we are excited to share that we have a new PS5 model launching. To address the evolving needs of players, our engineering and design teams collaborated on a new form factor that provides greater choice and flexibility.

Apple addresses iPhone 12 radiation emission with software fix,"With the software update, Apple is disabling body detection technology on the iPhone 12 to keep it at low power transmission at all times.","Apple has rolled out a new software update for the iPhone 12 to reduce power consumption and radiation emissions, even when it comes into contact with static surfaces. France recently banned the sale of the iPhone 12 in the country due to higher radiation emissions from the device, which Apple denied. They stated that the iPhone 12 was certified by multiple international bodies and complies with all radiation norms.

“We want all iPhone 12 users to know that the iPhone 12 (review) is safe to use and always has been. The iPhone 12 was certified to meet applicable worldwide energy transmission regulations and standards when it first shipped in 2020, and no changes have been made since then that would affect energy transmission,” Apple said in an official statement.
iPhones have special sensors that detect when the device is near a user’s body to reduce radiation emissions. When the iPhone is away from a user, there will be a slightly higher radiation emission, according to Apple. Apple also highlights why there is a discrepancy in France’s findings compared to others, stating that the protocol followed by the commission does not highlight this feature.

Generative AI hype to fade in 2024? Four bold AI predictions,CCS Insight's report suggests a reality check for generative AI. Are the costs and risks catching up with the hype?,"The hype surrounding AI technology has continued well into 2023 following the initial explosion in interest in ChatGPT when it was released in November 2022. And with new and exciting products and features being launched almost every week, it’s understandable why the hype has kept up.
However a new report by CCS Insight – a global technology research firm – has suggested that generative AI will face a reality check in 2024 when awareness about sustaining the running costs and mitigating associated risks will rise. The report has also predicted that an arrest for the first AI-based identity fraud will be made next year.
Intrigued? Let’s take a look at the top predictions.
ADVERTISEMENT
#1: Generative AI will face a reality check
Generative AI models including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Anthropic’s Claude have shown impressive capabilities in generating realistic and engaging content. Still, they also require massive amounts of computing power and data to train and run.
These colossal requirements may come home to roost in 2024. CCS Insight predicts that generative AI will face a reality check next year, as the hype around it will be replaced by the awareness of the cost, risk, and complexity involved in deploying and sustaining it.
Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC that generative AI is overhyped and there are many obstacles that need to be overcome to bring it to market. He pointed out that only a few large companies can afford to design and use their own specialised AI chips to run generative AI models, while many other organisations and developers will find it too expensive.
#2: EU’s AI regulation plans may face turbulence
At the same time, the European Union, which has been at the forefront of regulating AI and setting the benchmark for regulatory bodies around the world, will actually find it hard to keep up with the technicalities of the fast-growing industry.
ADVERTISEMENT
CCS Insight predicts that the EU AI regulation will encounter difficulties and will have to be revised and redrawn multiple times due to the fast pace of AI development. Currently, work is underway to pass the AI Act, a piece of regulation that would finally put under check the unfettered growth of AI. It’s set to ban tech like live facial recognition altogether.

#3: AI content warnings will become common
AI-generated content is becoming more prevalent and accessible on the internet, but it also poses challenges for verifying its authenticity and quality. AI-generated content can be used for various purposes, such as entertainment, education, marketing, or misinformation. However, some AI-generated content may contain factual errors or biases that can mislead or harm users.
CCS Insight predicts that a search engine will soon add content warnings to alert users that material they are viewing from a certain web publisher is AI-generated rather than made by people. The analysts said that this will be similar to how social media platforms added information labels to posts related to Covid-19 to combat misinformation about the virus. They said that this will be a necessary step to ensure trust and transparency in the online information landscape.
#4: AI-based identity fraud will lead to arrests
AI can also be used to impersonate someone’s identity, either through voice synthesis or deepfake technology. Voice synthesis is a type of generative AI that can create realistic audio clips of someone’s voice based on their speech samples. Deepfake is a type of generative AI that can create realistic video clips of someone’s face or body based on their image or video samples. These technologies can be used for various applications, such as entertainment, education, or security. However, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as fraud, blackmail, or harassment.
ADVERTISEMENT
CCS Insight predicts that police will make their first arrest of a person who uses AI to impersonate someone in 2024. The analysts said that this will be a new form of identity fraud that will exploit the vulnerability of people’s online identities. They said that this will require new methods of detection and prevention to protect people from being victimised by AI-based identity fraud.
As we enter 2024, we can expect to see more developments and debates around the future of AI and its impact on various domains. CCS has a clean track record when it comes to predictions, but of course, it’d be wise to take things with a pinch of salt, especially considering the fact that the AI landscape is such a rapidly evolving one.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/4-bold-ai-predictions-for-next-year-report-8976735/,technology

Too much eyestrain? This iOS 17 feature can improve your eye health,Do you often unknowingly hold your phone too close to your eyes? iOS 17 can help you with that.,"Many of us grew up watching cartoons on TV, and we probably heard our parents telling us to move away from the screen if we were sitting too close. They had a good reason: sitting too close to the TV can strain our eyes and make us more likely to develop nearsightedness.
But now, TV screens are not the only ones we stare at. We also have smartphones that we can take with us everywhere, and sometimes we hold them too close to our eyes without realising it. And unlike our parents, there is no one to remind us to keep a healthy distance between our eyes and our phones.
What if we could have a feature on our phones that would act like a parent and warn us when we are holding them too close to our eyes? Well, if you have an iPhone with iOS 17, you can enable such a feature and protect your eye health. Let’s take a look.

How to enable Screen Distance on iOS 17
Apple’s latest update for its mobile devices, iOS 17, comes with a new feature that aims to help users maintain a healthy distance from their screens. Screen Distance uses the TrueDepth camera, which is also used for Face ID, to measure how far your eyes are from your iPhone or iPad screen. If you tend to hold your device too close to your face for too long, Screen Distance will gently remind you to move it away.

Screen Distance is automatically enabled for children under 13 (this age may vary depending on your region) who are part of a Family Sharing group. For adults, you can turn on Screen Distance manually by following these steps:
1. Open Settings and tap on Screen Time.
2. Tap on Screen Distance and then tap on Continue.
3. You’ll see an explanation of how Screen Distance works now. Just tap on Continue again.

That’s it. Now your device will check the distance between your screen and eyes periodically. If it detects that you are holding your device closer than 12 inches (30 centimeters) for an extended period, it will show you a message saying “iPhone May Be Too Close.” You can then adjust the distance until you see a checkmark on the screen, and then tap on Continue to resume what you were doing.

Screen Distance is designed to protect your eyes from strain and fatigue caused by too much screen time. It does not collect any photos or videos of your face, and it does not send any data to Apple or anyone else. All the processing is done locally on your device.
Screen Distance is one of the many features that iOS 17 offers to improve your digital well-being. You can also use Screen Time to set limits and goals for your app usage, Downtime to schedule time away from your device, and Communication Limits to control who you can contact during certain hours.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/ios-17-screen-distance-how-to-8976377/,technology
"Wildlife finds human noises scarier than lion’s roar, finds study","Wild animals are more likely to flee from the sound of humans than that of a lion, finds a new study.","You might have heard that humans are the most dangerous animals in the world and whether you believe that or not, it seems that many animals do. A new study found that a majority of African mammals, including giraffes, hyenas and zebras, were more likely to flee from the sound of two humans talking than from the sounds of gunfire, lions or dogs.
For the study published in the journal Current Biology on Thursday, the researchers set up speakers and cameras around 21 watering holes in South Africa‘s Greater Kruger National Park during the dry season between June and August. During that time of the year, many other sources of water disappear, forcing animals to come to that watering hole.

Bing Image Creator users getting content warning for harmless text prompts,"Bing Image Creator, powered by DALL-E 3 seems to be censoring harmless prompts like ""a cat with a cowboy hat and boots"" and showing a content violation message.","Microsoft recently updated the Bing Image Creator with OpenAI’s latest text-to-image generation model – DALL-E 3. The latest version of the image creator can create super-realistic images and can be used to generate movie posters, book covers, design logos and even make infographics.
However, Bing Image Creator came under fire after Yahoo recently ran a story on how the AI-powered tool was able to generate images of Mickey Mouse flying a plane with a gun in hand with 2 skyscrapers in the background and another one showing the Disney character wearing a suicide vest with bombs.
Since then, Microsoft seems to have reinforced content guardrails for Bing Image Creator. But many are now saying that even harmless prompts like “a cat with a cowboy hat and boots” are being flagged as inappropriate.

Several users report they are getting a content violation message saying ‘Your image generations are not displayed because we detected unsafe content in the images based on our content policy. Please try again with another prompt.’
But it looks like Microsoft might be aware of the situation. After a user on X (formerly) asked Microsoft Windows head Mikhail Parakhin about harmless word patterns triggering Bing Image Creator, Parakhin said the team is checking reports of overclocking.
Hmm. This is weird – checking
— Mikhail Parakhin (@MParakhin) October 8, 2023
According to a report by WindowsCentral, Bing Image Creator’s ‘surprise me’ button, which generates random images on its own also seems to be censoring its own images. It goes on to say that this was not a rare occurrence and that the chances of it happening are around 30 per cent.
Microsoft might still be fine-tuning the guardrails, but if the tech giant goes too far, it might limit Bing Image Creator’s usefulness.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/bing-image-creator-harmless-prompts-warning-8976095/,technology

NASA to fly rockets into October 14 solar eclipse’s shadow,"As parts of the world get plunged into partial darkness during the October 14 annular solar eclipse, NASA will send rockets flying into the shadow of the eclipse.","On October 14, people in many parts of North and South America will see the Sun dimming to about 10 per cent of its normal brightness, leaving only a bright “ring of fire” as the annular eclipse happens. But those near the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico will also notice sudden bright streaks in the sky hurtling towards the eclipse—three rockets that NASA plans to launch.

“It is a huge disruption to business as usual,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors. He said in the short-term resources could be diverted if the conflict expands, such as staff at tech companies being called up as military reservists.
Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, said there will likely be a “tremendous effort” to guard physical installations for companies based in Israel from attacks because some technology spending is tied to the military.

Israel’s tech sector dates back to 1974 when Intel established a presence, but the start-up scene took off in the 1990s, earning a reputation as the world’s second-largest tech center outside of Silicon Valley, with thousands of companies and developing a significant ecosystem.
There are now 500 multinationals operating in Israel – mainly research and development centers after buying Israeli start-ups – from Intel to IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook.
In June, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Intel was planning to spend $25 billion on a new factory in the southern city of Kiryat Gat some 42 km (26 miles) from Gaza.

In the longer term, the tech and AI sector, where Israel has been a leader, could see increased investment because of the industries’ close tie-in with military spending, LPL’s Krosby said.
“They will probably increase the investment in AI,” Krosby said. “When a country is caught literally off guard the first thing they look at – beside the obvious problems with intelligence – is what was missed within the security systems.”
“It could bolster support for more financial resources for tech for the military, which then ultimately transitions to the private sector tech companies,” Krosby added.

"Watch this space: Night for Chandrayaan-3, new dawn for Gaganyaan","As the Chandrayaan-3 mission drifts off into sleep, Sethu Pradeep writes about ISRO's Gaganyaan mission and what the space agency will need to develop for it.","It has been all but confirmed—the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Chandrayaan-3 mission is not going to wake up again. But as the sun sets on the mission’s Vikram lander and Pragyan rover again, a new era of human space flight could be dawning for ISRO as it is set to conduct the first flight test of the Gaganyaan mission.
Chandrayaan-3 was designed to last for one lunar day or about 14 days on Earth. After it finished its science objectives, scientists put it in “sleep mode,” hoping that the lander and rover could be reawakened after the lunar night. But now, it seems clear that the extreme temperature and conditions of the lunar night mean that the mission will sleep forever.

Apple iPhone 15 Pro review: A reinterpretation of a masterpiece,The hard truth is that Apple does deserve special mention for not bringing something entirely new with the iPhone 15 Pro but for continuously iterating on the formula that makes the iPhone so special.,"Over the weekend, I happened to watch “The Godfather,” a movie that has remained a cultural phenomenon even 50 years after its release. The film has inspired numerous sequels and spin-offs, and its influence can still be felt across the industry. However, what truly makes the movie continue to resonate with audiences strongly is its complexity and depth of characters. I felt the same way when I was using the new iPhone 15 Pro. Each feature of the iPhone has a character of its own and is central to the core experience.
This makes the high-end iPhone 15 Pro particularly noteworthy as it strives to demonstrate the power and influence of the device. You know the iPhone, you understand the camera, and you are familiar with how the Apple ecosystem works, yet you are emotionally impacted by what it represents. That’s why the story of the iPhone is timeless, and the iPhone 15 Pro is a reinterpretation of a modern classic.

"South Korea warns Google, Apple of possible fines over apps marketing",The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said in a statement that the two tech giants forced app developers into specific payment methods and caused unfair delay in app review.,"South Korea’s telecommunications regulator said on Friday that Alphabet Inc’s Google and Apple have abused their dominant app market position and warned of possible fines totalling up to $50.5 million.
The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said in a statement that the two tech giants forced app developers into specific payment methods and caused unfair delay in app review.
The KCC is notifying the companies for corrective action, and will deliberate on the fines, the statement said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“What KCC has shared today is the ‘pre-notice’ and we will carefully review and submit our response. Once the final written decision is shared with us we will carefully review to evaluate the next course of action,” Google said in a statement to Reuters.
Apple also issued a statement, saying: “We disagree with the conclusions made by the KCC in their Examiner’s Report, and believe the changes we have implemented to the App Store comply with the Telecommunications Business Act. As we have always done, we will continue to engage with the KCC to share our views.”
In 2021, South Korea passed an amendment to the Telecommunication Business Act banning app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems.
The KCC said that Google and Apple’s enforcement of certain payment methods, and Apple’s “discriminatory charging of fees to domestic app developers” is likely to undermine the law’s purpose of promoting fair competition.

After hearing from the companies, the regulator could decide to impose fines of up to 68 billion won ($50.47 million), including 47.5 billion won for Google and 20.5 billion won for Apple, KCC said.

Amazon launches first test satellites for Kuiper internet network,"The mission aims to test Amazon's first pieces of technology in space as the e-commerce and web services giant looks to deploy 3,236 more satellites in the next few years and offer broadband internet globally.","Amazon’s first pair of prototype satellites for its planned Kuiper internet network were launched into space on Friday from Florida, the company’s first step before it deploys thousands more into orbit to beam internet service globally and compete with SpaceX’s Starlink.
A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket emblazoned with the Amazon logo lifted off from Cape Canaveral shortly after 2 p.m. Eastern time (1800 GMT), carrying the two Kuiper test satellites, a long-awaited mission Amazon initially had intended to launch using different rockets.
The mission aims to test Amazon’s first pieces of technology in space as the e-commerce and web services giant looks to deploy 3,236 more satellites in the next few years and offer broadband internet globally, a feat Elon Musk’s SpaceX is targeting with its nearly 5,000 Starlink satellites in orbit.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the days leading up to the launch, Amazon divulged few specifics about the two satellites, which were built at its satellite plant in Redmond, Washington.
The launch live stream hosted by the United Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture, ended shortly after the rocket’s liftoff without showing the deployment of the satellites. Amazon later said the two satellites were deployed and its mission operations center had made contact with them.
Amazon has vowed to invest $10 billion into its Kuiper project, which was announced in 2019, the year SpaceX began deploying its first operational Starlink spacecraft.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is requiring Amazon to deploy half its planned satellite constellation by 2026.
ADVERTISEMENT
The market for broadband internet service from low-Earth orbiting satellites is viewed as being worth up to tens of billions of dollars in the next decade.
With Starlink making SpaceX the world’s largest satellite operator, Amazon’s other rivals include Canada’s Telesat, which has not yet launched satellites, and French satellite firm Eutelsat’s OneWeb, which mainly offers its internet service to governments and businesses.
Like SpaceX, Amazon aims to target individual consumers and enterprise customers with Kuiper, pulling from its devices playbook to build consumer terminals at a company cost of $400 each – though it has not yet announced prices. SpaceX’s consumer Starlink terminals are priced at $599 each.
To deploy the rest of the Kuiper network, Amazon last year announced a bulk launch deal for 83 launches – the largest commercial rocket procurement ever – from various rocket companies, including Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, ULA and Europe’s Arianespace.

Amazon and Bezos, its founder, are facing a shareholder lawsuit over that launch deal that accuses the company of failing to do proper due diligence and failing to consider potentially cheaper rockets from its rival SpaceX.

Hackers advertise sale of 23andMe data on leaked data forum,The statement went on to say that a hacker may have collected passwords stolen from other sites and reused them in a bid to hijack 23andMe accounts.,"A hacker is advertising millions of “pieces of data” stolen from the family genetics websites 23andMe, according to posts made to an online forum where digital thieves often advertise leaked data.
23andMe said in a statement Friday that while an unspecified amount of “customer profile information” had been compiled “through access to individual 23andMe.com accounts,” the company itself had not been breached.
“We do not have any indication at this time that there has been a data security incident within our systems,” the statement said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The statement went on to say that a hacker may have collected passwords stolen from other sites and reused them in a bid to hijack 23andMe accounts. The technique – known as credential stuffing — is one reason why cybersecurity experts recommend against using the same password for different sites.
A second layer of password protection, known as two-factor authentication, can also help frustrate these kinds of hacks.
Reuters could not immediately find a way to contact the hacker, at least one of whose posts has since been removed from the forum. The size of the breach wasn’t immediately apparent and the hacker provided contradictory figures and description of what they had stolen.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/hackers-advertise-sale-of-23andme-data-on-leaked-data-forum-8973163/,technology
US-China tech war: RISC-V chip technology emerges as new battleground,"At issue is RISC-V, pronounced ""risk five,"" an open-source technology that competes with costly proprietary technology from British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings.","In a new front in the U.S.-China tech war, President Joe Biden’s administration is facing pressure from some lawmakers to restrict American companies from working on a freely available chip technology widely used in China – a move that could upend how the global technology industry collaborates across borders.
At issue is RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” an open-source technology that competes with costly proprietary technology from British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings. RISC-V can be used as a key ingredient for anything from a smartphone chip to advanced processors for artificial intelligence.
Some lawmakers – including two Republican House of Representatives committee chairmen, Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Mark Warner – are urging Biden’s administration to take action regarding RISC-V, citing national security grounds.
ADVERTISEMENT
The lawmakers expressed concerns that Beijing is exploiting a culture of open collaboration among American companies to advance its own semiconductor industry, which could erode the current U.S. lead in the chip field and help China modernize its military. Their comments represent the first major effort to put constraints on work by U.S. companies on RISC-V.
Representative Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House select committee on China, said in a statement to Reuters that the Commerce Department needs to “require any American person or company to receive an export license prior to engaging with PRC (People’s Republic of China) entities on RISC-V technology.”
Such calls to regulate RISC-V are the latest in the U.S.-China battle over chip technology that escalated last year with sweeping export restrictions that the Biden administration has told China it will update this month.
“The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is abusing RISC-V to get around U.S. dominance of the intellectual property needed to design chips. U.S. persons should not be supporting a PRC tech transfer strategy that serves to degrade U.S. export control laws,” Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement to Reuters.
ADVERTISEMENT
McCaul said he wants action from the Bureau of Industry and Security, the part of the Commerce Department that oversees export-control regulations, and would pursue legislation if that does not materialize.
The bureau “is constantly reviewing the technology landscape and threat environment, and continually assessing how best to apply our export control policies to protect national security and safeguard core technologies,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement.
“Communist China is developing open-source chip architecture to dodge our sanctions and grow its chip industry,” Rubio said in a statement to Reuters. “If we don’t broaden our export controls to include this threat, China will one day surpass us as the global leader in chip design.”
“I fear that our export-control laws are not equipped to deal with the challenge of open-source software – whether in advanced semiconductor designs like RISC-V or in the area of AI – and a dramatic paradigm shift is needed,” Warner said in a statement to Reuters.
ADVERTISEMENT
RISC-V is overseen by a Swiss-based nonprofit foundation that coordinates efforts among for-profit companies to develop the technology.
The RISC-V technology came from labs at the University of California, Berkeley, and later benefited from funding by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its creators have compared it to Ethernet, USB and even the internet, which are freely available and draw on contributions from around the world to make innovation faster and cheaper.
Huawei Technologies
Executives from China’s Huawei Technologies have embraced RISC-V as a pillar of that nation’s progress in developing its own chips. But the United States and its allies also have jumped on the technology, with chip giant Qualcomm working with a group of European automotive firms on RISC-V chips and Alphabet’s Google saying it will make Android, the world’s most popular mobile operating system, work on RISC-V chips.
Qualcomm declined to comment. Its executives said in August they believe RISC-V will speed up chip innovation and transform the tech industry.
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
ADVERTISEMENT
If Biden’s administration were to regulate U.S. companies’ participation in the Swiss-based foundation in the manner lawmakers are seeking, the move could complicate how American and Chinese companies work together on open technical standards. It also could create hurdles for China’s pursuit of chip self-sufficiency, as well as for U.S. and European efforts to create cheaper and more versatile chips.
Jack Kang, vice president of business development at SiFive, a Santa Clara, California-based startup using RISC-V, said potential U.S. government restrictions on American companies regarding RISC-V would be a “tremendous tragedy.”
“It would be like banning us from working on the internet,” Kang said. “It would be a huge mistake in terms of technology, leadership, innovation and companies and jobs that are being created.”
Regulating the open discussion of technologies is rarer than regulating physical products, but not impossible, said Kevin Wolf, an export-control attorney at law firm Akin Gump who served in the Commerce Department under former President Barack Obama. Existing rules on chip exports could help provide a legal framework for such a proposal, Wolf said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/us-china-tech-war-risc-v-chip-technology-emerges-as-new-battleground-8973159/,technology

"New iPads on the horizon: What to expect from upcoming Mini, Air & Pro models","Apple is cooking up some new iPads for 2023 and 2024, including a new iPad mini, two new iPad Air models, an M3 iPad Pro, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard.","Apple’s iPad lineup is due for a refresh, as the company has not launched any new models since October 2022, when it unveiled the M2 iPad Pro and the iPad 10. However, 9to5Mac has learned from sources that Apple is working on several new iPads for the coming months, including a new iPad mini, two new iPad Air models, and an M3 iPad Pro.
What to expect from the new iPads
Confirming previous reports, Apple is planning to release a new iPad mini, codenamed J126b, in late 2023 or early 2024, according to the sources. The iPad mini 7 will likely retain the same design as the current generation, which was launched in September 2021 with an A15 Bionic chip. The new iPad mini will probably feature a faster chip, but other details are still unknown.

ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips,"Since at least last year, OpenAI discussed various options to solve the shortage of expensive AI chips that OpenAI relies on, according to people familiar with the matter.","OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is exploring making its own artificial intelligence chips and has gone as far as evaluating a potential acquisition target, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.
The company has not yet decided to move ahead, according to recent internal discussions described to Reuters. However, since at least last year it discussed various options to solve the shortage of expensive AI chips that OpenAI relies on, according to people familiar with the matter.
These options have included building its own AI chip, working more closely with other chipmakers including Nvidia and also diversifying its suppliers beyond Nvidia.
ADVERTISEMENT
OpenAI declined to comment. CEO Sam Altman has made the acquisition of more AI chips a top priority for the company. He has publicly complained about the scarcity of graphics processing units, a market dominated by Nvidia, which controls more than 80% of the global market for the chips best suited to run AI applications. The effort to get more chips is tied to two major concerns Altman has identified: a shortage of the advanced processors that power OpenAI’s software and the “eye-watering” costs associated with running the hardware necessary to power its efforts and products.
Since 2020, OpenAI has developed its generative artificial intelligence technologies on a massive supercomputer constructed by Microsoft, one of its largest backers, that uses 10,000 of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs).
Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. If ChatGPT queries grow to a tenth the scale of Google search, it would require roughly $48.1 billion worth of GPUs initially and about $16 billion worth of chips a year to keep operational.
Custom chips era
An effort to develop its own AI chips would put OpenAI among a small group of large tech players such as Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com that have sought to take control over designing the chips that are fundamental to their businesses.
ADVERTISEMENT
It is not clear whether OpenAI will move ahead with a plan to build a custom chip. Doing so would be a major strategic initiative and a heavy investment that could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars a year in costs, according to industry veterans. Even if OpenAI committed resources to the task it would not guarantee success. An acquisition of a chip company could speed the process of building OpenAI’s own chip – as it did for Amazon.com and its acquisition of Annapurna Labs in 2015.
OpenAI had considered the path to the point where it performed due diligence on a potential acquisition target, according to one of the people familiar with its plans.
The identity of the company OpenAI examined purchasing could not be learned.
Even if OpenAI goes ahead with plans for a custom chip – including an acquisition – the effort is likely to take several years leaving the company dependent on commercial providers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in the meantime. Some big tech companies have been building their own processors for years with limited results. Meta’s custom chip effort has been beset with issues, leading the company to scrap some of its AI chips, according to a Reuters report. The Facebook owner is now working on a newer chip that will span all types of AI work.
ADVERTISEMENT
OpenAI’s main backer, Microsoft, is also developing a custom AI chip that OpenAI is testing, The Information has reported. The plans could signal further distancing between the two companies.
Demand for specialized AI chips has soared since the launch of ChatGPT last year. Specific chips, or AI accelerators, are necessary to train and run the latest generative AI technology. Nvidia is one of the few chipmakers that produces useful AI chips and dominates the market.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-8972389/,technology

"Apple Watch Series 9 review: Time to help the planet, one tick at a time","Apple Watch Series 9 is the perfect fusion of tech and sustainability. But, does eco-friendly innovation make for a user-friendly smartwatch?","There are times when you lose sense of time… or suddenly realise how insignificant your time on earth has been in the larger scheme of things. Strolling along the toy train tracks of Sayaji Baug in Vadodara or walking under the porches of the Lakshmi Vilas Palace in this once royal city, you get this feeling of not being in sync with time, even as a shiny new watch on your wrist reminds you that you don’t need to be a wealthy king to leave an impact on the world you live in.
The Apple Watch Series 9 is maybe the first tick in the direction of how technology positively impacts the environment, or to put it more bluntly stops impacting the environment. Apple Watch Series 9 is the first carbon neutral Apple product, not just because it uses recycled aluminium in the case or because it comes with a sports loop strap made of recycled material. The entire range will also be shipped via ocean so as to reduce its carbon footprint and Apple will produce enough green power to offset what is needed to charge all these watches over their lifecycle.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/apple-watch-series-9-review-8972053/,technology

Google Pixel 8 Pro runs generative AI models: Can compact LLMs change the way we use smartphones?,Imagine a smaller version of ChatGPT built into your device for certain functions. The Google Pixel 8 Pro has just that.,"You might think that large language models (LLMs) with billions or even trillions of parameters, such as ChatGPT, are the ultimate tools for natural language processing. But these models come with a huge cost: they require massive amounts of computing power and are super-pricey to run. That’s why many experts believe that smaller, more specialised models trained on richer data will soon take over today’s general-purpose LLMs.
And guess what? The future is already here. Google has just announced that its new Pixel 8 Pro smartphone comes with its own generative AI models built in. This doesn’t mean that you can run Bard, Google’s own version of ChatGPT, offline on your phone. But it does mean that you can use some of its features without relying on the cloud. Let’s see how.

"Apple almost bought Bing from Microsoft in 2018, reveals exec’s testimony",What if Apple owned Bing? A new transcript reveals how close the tech giants came to a partnership in 2018.,"In 2018, Apple was considering a major move that could have changed the landscape of online search: buying Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, or at least investing billions of dollars in a joint venture with the software giant. This is according to a recently unsealed transcript of testimony from John Giannandrea, Apple’s senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, and a former Google executive.
Giannandrea’s testimony was part of the ongoing antitrust case against Google, where the Department of Justice is trying to prove that Google has used its contracts with Apple and other companies to exclude its search rivals and maintain its monopoly. Google pays Apple as much as $19 billion per year to be the default search engine on Apple products, according to an estimate.

Jabra Elite 10 review: Blending work and play in one audio device,The Jabra Elite 10 is clearly a top-end truly wireless earphone meant for those who want a single device that blends both work and play seamlessly.,"Jabra has been right there with Apple, Sony and others in the truly wireless segment over the past few years, finding favour with those who want an earphone that is versatile enough to handle the pressures of work and play. The new Elite 10 takes forward the same legacy but adds new features that are useful in both aspects.
The Elite 10 has some trademark Jabra looks but has a charging case as well as EarPods that are a bit different when it comes to design — the charging case is slimmer though large, while the EarPods have an in-ear design that looks new with a shiny touch face. The EarPods fit really well without any twisting or turning and without the use of any fins. And it stays there whatever you do. However, the cream colour of the review unit might not be very conducive to Indian conditions. A couple of days in my messenger bag and it started showing its true colours. Opt for the black; it is always safer.

"Android 14 is here: From features to eligible devices, here’s everything you need to know","Android 14 is here, and it's all about improving the user experience. Check out the top features, including snazzy lock screen customisation and more.","It’s fair to say that Android is now a mature operating system. Google is seemingly done with tinkering with how the operating system looks and is instead focusing on how it feels. That grows more apparent with Android 14. The update, as expected, doesn’t bring about groundbreaking features or visual changes (except for the snazzy lock screen customisation). Rather, it prioritises improving existing functions and oiling up stuff under the hood so that everything runs smoother than before. Let’s take a look.
Android 14 top features
Lock screen customisation
Android users have long appreciated the ability to personalise their home screens, but with Android 14, the customisation game has reached a new level. The update introduces a lock screen picker, lock screen templates, a monochromatic theme, and support for Ultra HDR images. But it doesn’t stop there – Android 14 also lets users create parallax effect wallpapers from their own photos, craft cartoon-style wallpapers with their favourite emojis, and even generate AI-powered wallpapers based on text prompts.

ISRO gearing up for Gaganyaan mission’s first abort test of crew escape system this month-end,"ISRO is gearing up for the first abort test of the crew escape system for Gaganyaan, which will be the first crewed space mission undertaken by the Indian agency.","ISRO plans to undertake an inflight abort test of the crew escape system by this month-end using a test vehicle developed as part of the country’s ambitious maiden human spaceflight venture Gaganyaan.
“Preparations are going on. All vehicle systems have reached Sriharikota (for the launch). Final assembly is progressing. We are getting ready for launch by the end of October,” Director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) S Unnikrishnan Nair told PTI on Thursday.
“(With) this crew escape system, we will demonstrate (validate) in different conditions like high dynamic pressure and for transonic conditions,” Nair added Thiruvananthapuram-based VSSC is the lead centre of ISRO under the Department of Space.

An ISRO official said the crew escape system (CES) is the most important element in Gaganyaan.
According to ISRO officials, this month’s launch of the test vehicle TV-D1 would be the first of the four abort missions of the Gaganyaan programme. It would be followed by the second test vehicle TV-D2 mission and first uncrewed mission of Gaganyaan (LVM3-G1).
The second series of test vehicle missions (TV-D3 & D4) and LVM3-G2 mission with robotic payload is planned next. The crewed mission is planned based on the outcome of the successful test vehicle and the missions in which no crew is on board, they said.
The test vehicle is a single-stage rocket, based on liquid propulsion, developed to validate the CES performance at different critical Mach numbers but Nair said it can be used for many purposes including space tourism.
“We are taking (the test vehicle) to transonic conditions. That means crossing the Mach number of one. We will go to something like Mach number of 1.2. That reaches around 12 km altitude. From there, the escape system will be activated, and that will go some 20 km, and from there the crew module will be released,” he explained.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This vehicle can be used for space tourism, if any industry is interested. Same vehicle can take a crew module to 100 km and then come back. That’s possible. If anybody is interested, this vehicle can be used for that,” Nair said.
The Crew Module is habitable with Earth-like environment in space for the crew. It is of double-walled construction consisting of a pressurised metallic inner structure and unpressurised external structure with thermal protection system.
It houses the crew interfaces, human centric products, life support system, avionics and deceleration systems. It is also designed for re-entry to ensure safety of the crew during descent till touchdown.
According to ISRO officials, the Gaganyaan project would demonstrate India’s capability of taking a crew of two to three members to a circular orbit of about 400 km around the earth for a one-to-three days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in a designated location in Indian sea waters.

The LVM3 rocket, the heavy lift launcher of ISRO, is identified as the launch vehicle for the Gaganyaan mission. It consists of solid stage, liquid stage and cryogenic stage. All systems in LVM3 are re-configured to meet human rating requirements and christened Human Rated LVM3 (HLVM3).
Nair said the LVM3 cannot be used for conducting tests to validate CES, saying it’s an expensive rocket.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/isro-gaganyaan-crewed-mission-8970139/,technology

Point of no return: Pope challenges leaders at UN talks to slow global warming before it’s too late,"Pope Francis warns the world is ""collapsing"" due to climate change and may be ""near its breaking point.""","Pope Francis shamed and challenged world leaders on Wednesday to commit to binding targets to slow climate change before it’s too late, warning that God’s increasingly warming creation is fast reaching a “point of no return.”
In an unusually bleak update to his landmark 2015 encyclical on the environment, Francis heightened the alarm about the “irreversible” harm to people and planet already under way and lamented that once again, the world’s poor and most vulnerable are paying the highest price.
“We are now unable to halt the enormous damage we have caused. We barely have time to prevent even more tragic damage,” Francis warned. He took square aim at the United States, noting that per-capita emissions in the U.S. are twice as high as China and seven times greater than the average in poor countries.

While individual, household efforts are helping, “we can state that a broad change in the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model would have a significant long-term impact,” he said. The document, “Praise God,” was released on the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, the pontiff’s nature-loving namesake, and was aimed at spurring negotiators to commit to binding climate targets at the next round of U.N. talks in Dubai.
Francis weighed in on a key and contentious point of negotiations — whether countries should agree to a phase out of coal, oil and natural gas, the fossil fuels that are causing climate change. He is for it. As fast as possible even, he wrote.Using precise scientific data, sharp diplomatic arguments and a sprinkling of theological reasoning, Francis delivered a moral imperative for the world to transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy with measures that that are “efficient, obligatory and readily monitored.”
“What is being asked of us is nothing other than a certain responsibility for the legacy we will leave behind, once we pass from this world,” he said.
U.S. climate scientist Carlos Martinez, a committed Catholic who heads a multifaith committee for the American Meteorological Society, said it reads like a report card for Earth and its people and “it appears from the language that he would give students a D, like a D-. Because there has been some progress, but it’s not where it needs to be.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s very direct,” Martinez said. “He does not mince his words as to the state of the environment and its impacts to people and to communities.”This is one of the least hopeful messages that Pope Francis has issued, Martinez said. But it is scientifically accurate, he and other scientists told The Associated Press.
“The tone is appropriate given the magnitude of the challenges we face,” Northern Illinois University climate scientist Victor Gensini said. As it is, Francis’ 2015 encyclical “Praise Be” was a watershed moment for the Catholic Church, the first time a pope had used one of his most authoritative teaching documents to recast the climate debate in moral terms.
In that text, which has been cited by presidents, patriarchs and premiers and spurred an activist movement in the church, Francis called for a bold cultural revolution to correct a “structurally perverse” economic system where the rich exploit the poor, turning Earth into an “immense pile of filth.”
Even though encyclicals are meant to stand the test of time, Francis said he felt an update to his original was necessary because “our responses have not been adequate, while the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point.”
ADVERTISEMENT
He excoriated people, including those in the church, who doubt mainstream climate science about heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, sarcastically deflating their arguments and showing his impatience with their profit-at-all-cost mentality. Shaming them for their reliance on “allegedly solid scientific data,” he said the doubters’ arguments about potential job losses from a clean energy transition were bunk.
And he cited data showing that increased emissions and the corresponding rise in global temperatures have accelerated since the Industrial Revolution, and particularly in the last 50 years. “It is no longer possible to doubt the human – ‘anthropic’ – origin of climate change,” he asserted.
While acknowledging that “certain apocalyptic diagnoses” may not be grounded, he said inaction is no longer an option. The devastation is already under-way, he said, including with some already “irreversible” harm done to biodiversity and species loss that will only snowball unless urgent action is taken now.
“Small changes can cause greater ones, unforeseen and perhaps already irreversible, due to factors of inertia,” he noted. “This would end up precipitating a cascade of events having a snowball effect. In such cases, it is always too late, since no intervention will be able to halt a process once begun.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The document was unusual for a papal exhortation and read more like a U.N. scientific report or a speech to a “Fridays for Future” youth climate rally. It carried a sharp, no holds barred tone and its footnotes had far more references to U.N. climate reports, NASA and Francis’ own previous encyclicals than Scripture.“Praise God,” was issued ahead of the next round of U.N. climate talks which begin Nov. 30 in Dubai.
Just as he did with his 2015 encyclical “Praise Be,” which was penned before the start of the Paris climate conference, Francis aimed to cast the issue of global warming in stark moral terms to spur courageous decisions by world leaders.In the 2015 landmark Paris Agreement, countries of the world agreed to try to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) or at least 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. It’s already warmed about 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-1800s.
Since 2015, the world has spewed at least 288 billion metric tons (317 billion U.S. tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air, not including this year’s emissions, according to the scientists at Global Carbon Project. In August 2015, there were 399 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air and in August 2023 it was up to 420 parts per million, a 5% jump.
The record-hot summer of 2023 is one-third of a degree Celsius (six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) warmer than the summer of 2015, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Antarctica and Greenland have lost more than 2,100 billion metric tons (2,300 billion U.S. tons) of land ice, since the summer of 2015, according to NASA. And in the United States alone, there have been 152 climate or weather disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage since the pope’s first climate message, with costs adjusted for inflation, according to NOAA.

Francis devoted an entire section of his document on upcoming climate negotiations in Dubai, saying a switch in the way the world gets its energy has to be “drastic, intense and count on the commitment of all.”“That is not what has happened so far,” he wrote. He asked that negotiators consider the common good “and the future of their children more than the short-term interests of certain countries or businesses.”“’Praise God’ is the title of this letter. For when human beings claim to take God’s place, they become their own worst enemies,” he wrote.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/pope-francis-climate-change-point-of-no-return-8970071/,technology
Samsung Opera House turns 5: A look at the flagship store celebrating culture & innovation,The century-old Opera House is now a hub for Samsung India to showcase its latest innovations and to engage with users through various activities.,"Samsung recently celebrated the fifth anniversary of its flagship store – Samsung Opera House at Ashok Nagar, Bengaluru.Over the years, the flagship store by the South Korean tech giant has seen an increase in footfalls. At present, it has an average of 2,000 visitors each day.
The company took some years to restore the Opera House before it was open to the public in 2018. The restoration of the building ensured that it did not lose the original sheen of the iconic structure. The Opera House has a unique history, as it was once the venue for operas and dance performances in the 1930s under British rule. Years later the building was transformed into a movie theatre.

Ancient rock formations can emit massive amounts of carbon dioxide,It was a widely held view that ancient rock formations can act as a carbon sink. But a new study has revealed that they can throw up a lot more carbon dioxide than previously understood.,"A new study goes against the view that ancient rock formations can act as a carbon sink, instead suggesting that they can act as a massive source of carbon dioxide that can rival volcanoes.
The study published yesterday in the journal Nature could mean that scientists need to adjust their models that explore climate change scenarios. Rocks hold vast amounts of carbon stored in the ancient remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. The “geological carbon cycle” helps regulate the planet’s temperature.

SoftBank CEO Son says artificial general intelligence will come within 10 years,"Son has spoken of the potential of AGI - typically using the term ""singularity"" - to transform business and society for some years, but this is the first time he has given a timeline for its development.","SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said he believes artificial general intelligence (AGI), artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence in almost all areas, will be realised within 10 years.
Speaking at the SoftBank World corporate conference, Son said he believes AGI will be ten times more intelligent than the sum total of all human intelligence. He noted the rapid progress in generative AI that he said has already exceeded human intelligence in certain areas.
“It is wrong to say that AI cannot be smarter than humans as it is created by humans,” he said. “AI is now self learning, self training, and self inferencing, just like human beings.”

Son has spoken of the potential of AGI – typically using the term “singularity” – to transform business and society for some years, but this is the first time he has given a timeline for its development.
He also introduced the idea of “Artificial Super Intelligence” at the conference which he claimed would be realised in 20 years and would surpass human intelligence by a factor of 10,000.
Son is known for several canny bets that have turned SoftBank into a tech investment giant as well as some bets that have spectacularly flopped.
He’s also prone to making strident claims about the transformative impact of new technologies. His predictions about the mobile internet have been largely borne out while those about the Internet of Things have not.
ADVERTISEMENT
Son called upon Japanese companies to “wake up” to the promise of AI, arguing they had increasingly fallen behind in the internet age and reiterated his belief in chip designer Arm as core to the “AI revolution”.
Arm CEO Rene Haas, speaking at the conference via video, touted the energy efficiency of Arm’s designs, saying they would become increasingly sought after to power artificial intelligence.
Son said he thinks he is the only person who believes AGI will come within a decade.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified on Monday, saying that tech giants were competing for vast troves of content needed to train artificial intelligence, and complained Google was locking up content with expensive and exclusive deals with publishers.

A new study seems to have settled that debate once and for all.,"Venus is an extremely inhospitable planet.

But a new study suggests that it may be a slightly less dangerous place than we once thought.
Apart from its searing temperatures and crushing atmospheric pressure, it was a long held scientific belief that there could also be constant strobes of lightning on the unsavoury planet named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.

YouTube bug allows users to upload ‘undeletable’ hardcore porn: Report,A YouTube bug is reportedly allowing users to upload pornography videos to the platform that stay there even after the accounts behind them are deleted.,"YouTube is the largest video streaming platform in the world and it is owned by one of the biggest tech companies in the world—Google. So it’s only expected that it has very strict content moderation controls. But it seems like some YouTube users could exploit a bug on the site that allowed them to upload hardcore pornography, according to a report.
Interestingly, these videos seemingly continued to be hosted on the site even after the accounts that uploaded the pornographic content were deleted. 404 Media reports on the technique that many “YouTube hackers” can seemingly get around the platform’s content rules to upload videos. In some cases, these users seem to have lifted videos straight out of pornography websites like PornHub and uploaded them to YouTube.

NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission brought a lot more asteroid sample than expected,NASA's initial curation of the Asteroid Bennu sample brought back to Earth by OSIRIS-REx is off to a slow start as the mission brought back more than expected.,"After NASA’s (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) OSIRIS-REx mission brought back a bit of the asteroid Bennu to Earth, the initial curation process of the sample is going much slower than expected. But there is a good reason for that—it brought back a lot more material than the scientists expected.

LinkedIn taps AI to make it easier for firms to find job candidates,"The Microsoft-owned social network for business professionals has been using technology from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT that Microsoft has invested in, to develop the features.","LinkedIn on Tuesday said it will add artificial intelligence features to its core businesses, allowing recruiters to find job candidates by asking questions in natural language and letting marketing professionals create ad campaigns in a few clicks.
The Microsoft-owned social network for business professionals has been using technology from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT that Microsoft has invested in, to develop the features.
LinkedIn has more than 950 million members, the vast majority of whom do not pay for the service. Its primary businesses is charging money to recruiters and marketing and sales professionals for access to its trove of data.
ADVERTISEMENT
Traditionally, that has required those customers to search LinkedIn’s database by using data filters, keywords and other search engine techniques, essentially translating a natural query like “I want to hire a software developer with 10 years of experience in Minneapolis” into language that LinkedIn’s database can understand.
Now, recruiters can pose the same question naturally, and the computer can ask questions back. For example it may ask the recruiter whether they are interested in qualified applicants in another city where the company also has offices, or people whose job titles are not an exact match but have similar skills.
Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn’s chief executive, told Reuters that in an age when job titles are changing rapidly, LinkedIn is trying to encourage hiring people whose skills fit the job requirements, regardless of title or education.
“When you just focus on whether someone went to an Ivy League school or worked at Google, you’re talking about a very narrow set of people that everyone is trying to hire. When you focus on the skills that are required to do the job effectively, all of a sudden, you see there are tens of thousands of candidates out there,” he said. “You can’t just look at job titles.”

LinkedIn is adding similar tools for sales professionals searching for prospects and is also introducing a tool that will use AI to read a company’s website and create a marketing campaign for business-to-business products and services that will then run on LinkedIn’s site.
The company, which had more than $15 billion in revenue in the previous 12 months, does not plan to charge extra for the new features.
Some of the features will automate parts of their users’ jobs.
“For the majority of the world, you’re going to find that those tasks are going to be augmented by AI, so your role is going to need to adapt a little bit,” Roslansky said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/linkedin-taps-ai-to-make-it-easier-for-firms-to-find-job-candidates-8967478/,technology

"HMD starts making Nokia phones in Europe, launches 5G smartphone","Before HMD opened its Hungarian operations, Europe had no large-scale smartphone manufacturing as major companies like Apple and Samsung make their phones in Asia to keep costs down.","HMD Global, which makes Nokia-branded phones, has become the first major smartphone company to manufacture devices in Europe with its first made-in-Hungary 5G model, aimed at data security-conscious customers, now available for purchase.
“We are thrilled to be manufacturing the Nokia XR21, our signature rugged 5G smartphone, in Europe,” HMD Global co-founder, chairman and CEO Jean-Francois Baril said on Tuesday.
Before HMD opened its Hungarian operations, Europe had no large-scale smartphone manufacturing as major companies like Apple and Samsung make their phones in Asia to keep costs down.
ADVERTISEMENT
Most of Apple’s iPhones are made in China, a key market for the U.S. company. However, concerns over national security have come to the fore in recent years, prompting the U.S. to place technology sanctions on Huawei’s mobile business, while China expanded curbs on the use of iPhones by state employees.
“We are dedicated to investing in security, technology and manufacturing processes that make our devices more secure and longer lasting,” Baril said.
HMD said the first European model was designed for enterprise customers, some of whom had requested additional security in conjunction with their IT security partners.
The company already stores data in the European Union, with consumer and corporate data from all of its smartphones held and processed on servers in Finland since 2019.

HMD signed an exclusive 10-year licensing agreement with Nokia Oyj, once the world’s largest phone maker, in 2016 to make Nokia-branded smartphones and tablets.
It said in March it would start manufacturing in the European Union, which has been encouraging companies to set up production in key sectors such as semiconductors.
The Nokia XR21 European edition is priced from 649 euros, or 549 pounds, the company said.

Meta to lay off employees in metaverse silicon unit on Wednesday,"If the cuts are deep, they could hamper Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's project to build augmented and virtual reality products enabling access to a set of immersive virtual worlds known as the ""metaverse,"" particularly the AR glasses that he has predicted ""will redefine our relationship with technology.""","Meta is planning to lay off employees on Wednesday in the unit of its metaverse-oriented Reality Labs division focused on creating custom silicon, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Employees were informed of the layoffs in a post on Meta’s internal discussion forum Workplace on Tuesday. The post said they would be notified about their status with the company by early Wednesday morning, one of the sources said.
A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans. Reuters was not able to determine the extent of the cuts to the silicon unit, called Facebook Agile Silicon Team, or FAST.

If the cuts are deep, they could hamper Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s project to build augmented and virtual reality products enabling access to a set of immersive virtual worlds known as the “metaverse,” particularly the AR glasses that he has predicted “will redefine our relationship with technology.”
The FAST unit, which has roughly 600 employees, worked on developing custom chips to equip Meta’s devices to perform unique tasks and operate more efficiently, differentiating them from others entering the nascent AR/VR market.
However, Meta has struggled to make chips that can compete with silicon produced by external providers and has turned to chipmaker Qualcomm to produce chips for its devices currently on the market.
A restructuring of FAST has been expected since the spring, when Meta hired a new executive to lead the unit.
ADVERTISEMENT
A separate chip-making unit in Meta’s infrastructure division focused on artificial intelligence work has likewise hit roadblocks. The executive overseeing those efforts announced her departure last week, although Meta has appointed someone else to take over her role and continue those efforts.
Meta currently makes a line of mixed reality headsets called Quest and smart glasses designed with Ray-Ban eyeglass maker EssilorLuxottica that can stream video and speak with wearers through a new AI virtual assistant.
It announced new versions of the smart glasses and its consumer-oriented Quest headset, Quest 3, at its annual Connect conference last week.
The company is also working on more technically challenging and less bulky AR glasses that look more like regular glasses, along with associated smart watches, according to one of the sources.
ADVERTISEMENT
A first version of that product is set to be completed next year, although Meta is not initially planning to make it widely available to consumers, the source said.
Meta has slashed around 21,000 jobs since November of last year as it has sought to reassure investors that it was reining in costs amid waning revenue growth, high inflation and concerns that Reality Labs was losing too much money.
In a statement in March, Zuckerberg said the bulk of this year’s layoffs would happen in the spring, but that “in a small number of cases, it may take through the end of the year to complete these changes.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/meta-to-lay-off-employees-in-metaverse-silicon-unit-on-wednesday-8967464/,technology

Ericsson says operators need to highlight where 5G gives users higher capacity,It's true that smartphones connected to a 5G network can offer much faster data download and upload speeds. But the real-world impact of 5G isn't always what has been advertised by operators or handset makers.,"5G, which completes a year in India this month, needs to highlight more realistic use cases that have a daily impact on the consumer, Jasmeet Singh Sethi, Head of Ericsson ConsumerLab, said, adding that “hype marketing with use cases that are too far-fetched” could have been avoided.
“From an operator’s perspective, we need to think about the important use cases for 5G because the whole angle about 5G is to give you higher capacity where you need it, in congested locations and high footfall areas such as airports, public transportation hubs, stadiums, arenas, or even indoor shopping malls. This is where that elevation of experience needs to come in,” explained Sethi.

Sennheiser Ambeo Mini review: Top-end audio in compact form,"Unlike the Soundbar Plus, the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Mini will not feel out of place in front of a 32-inch television… it is just about that size.","It was just a few weeks back that I reviewed the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus with Dolby Atmos to take your home entertainment to a whole new level. But not everyone has the space for the large soundbar or the appetite to pay for what it costs.
This is where the Ambeo Soundbar Mini comes into play, literally a mini version of the Plus, this too can be yoked with the Sennheiser subwoofer. Unlike the Soundbar Plus (review), the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Mini will not feel out of place in front of a 32-inch television… it is just about that size. However, the subwoofer that comes with it is not smaller, it is the same as the one with the Plus model.

Microsoft CEO says tech giants battling for content to build AI,"Nadella said building artificial intelligence took computing power, or servers, and data to train the software. On servers, he said: ""No problem, we are happy to put in the dollars.""","Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said Monday tech giants were competing for vast troves of content needed to train artificial intelligence, and complained Google was locking up content with expensive and exclusive deals with publishers.
Testifying in a landmark U.S. trial against its rival Google, the first major antitrust case brought by the U.S. since it sued Microsoft in 1998, Nadella testified the tech giants’ efforts to build content libraries to train their large language models “reminds me of the early phases of distribution deals.”
Distribution agreements are at the core of the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust fight against Google. The government says that Google, with some 90% of the search market, illegally pays $10 billion annually to smartphone makers like Apple and wireless carriers like AT&T and others to be the default search engine on their devices.

The clout in search makes Google a heavy hitter in the lucrative advertising market, boosting its profits.
Nadella said building artificial intelligence took computing power, or servers, and data to train the software. On servers, he said: “No problem, we are happy to put in the dollars.”
But without naming Google, he said it was “problematic” if other companies locked up exclusive deals with big content makers.
“When I am meeting with publishers now, they say Google’s going to write this check and it’s exclusive and you have to match it,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Rebuffed by Apple
Nadella also testified that Microsoft had sought to make its Bing search engine the default on Apple smartphones but was rebuffed.
John Schmidtlein, Google’s lead lawyer, pressed Nadella on occasions when Microsoft did win default status on computers and mobile phones but users still bypassed Bing and continued to use Google by a wide margin.
Schmidtlein argued that Microsoft had made a series of strategic errors that led to Bing’s inability to grab a foothold, including a failure to invest in servers or engineers to improve Bing and a failure to see the mobile revolution.
Schmidtlein also said Microsoft’s success in becoming the default – on some Verizon phones in 2008, and BlackBerry and Nokia in 2011 – ended with the same result: users bypassed Bing and did the vast majority of their searches on Google.
ADVERTISEMENT
On laptops, most of which use Microsoft operating systems, Bing is the default search engine and has a market share below 20%, Nadella acknowledged.
“You get up in the morning and you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” he added in a reference to Google’s dominance in search.
Question of quality
Judge Amit Mehta, who will decide the case being tried in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, asked Nadella why Apple would switch to Bing given the Microsoft product’s lower quality.
The question suggests Google’s argument – that it is dominant because of its quality and not because of illegal activity – has caught the judge’s interest.
ADVERTISEMENT
Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, long after the tech giant faced its own federal antitrust lawsuit. That court fight, which ended in a 2001 settlement, forced Microsoft to end some business practices and opened the door to companies like Google.
As Google, which was founded in 1998, became an industry-leading search engine, the two became bitter rivals. Both have browsers, search engines, email services and a host of other overlaps. They became rivals in artificial intelligence more recently, with Microsoft investing heavily in OpenAI and Google building the Bard AI chatbot among other investments.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-tech-giants-battling-for-content-to-build-ai-8965993/,technology

ChatGPT with Vision overtakes Google Bard: Why it is the future of AI-powered conversations,"OpenAI released some astounding features for ChatGPT a few days ago, and the AI community is all shaken up.","Artificial Intelligence is making strides across industries. And, San Francisco-based OpenAI has been leading the pack, ever since it announced ChatGPT in November 2022. Although the runaway success of ChatGPT triggered a race among tech giants to bring the best of generative AI in their products and services, subsequent upgrades and modifications from OpenAI have helped it race ahead of all its peers.
On September 25, the Sam Altman-led company announced voice and image capabilities for its sensational chatbot. The new feature now allows an intuitive type of interface by allowing users to have voice conversations or share images with the chatbot. This is the first time that OpenAI is doing something like this.
“Voice and image give you more ways to use ChatGPT in your life. Snap a picture of a landmark while travelling and have a live conversation about what’s interesting about it. When you’re home, snap pictures of your fridge and pantry to figure out what’s for dinner (and ask follow-up questions for a step-by-step recipe). After dinner, help your child with a math problem by taking a photo, circling the problem set, and having it share hints with both of you,” said the company in a blog post announcing the rollout of the feature to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users. Meanwhile, voice features are now available on iOS and Android.

In July, Google in a bid to stay ahead of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Anthropic and many others, introduced multi-modality in its chatbot – Google Bard. The updates to Bard included analysis of images, different styles of responses, more languages etc. However, with ChatGPT Vision, OpenAI has yet again proved that it is the pioneer in AI innovation and a formidable force. The excitement around ChatGPT’s new features is similar to that was witnessed in November 2022 when the chatbot made its way to the public consciousness.
Why is it a big deal?
ChatGPT with vision isn’t out yet, but the people who have access to it are showing some mind-blowing capabilities with the new feature. The new capabilities make it one of the most fruitful AI product announcements in recent times. There is a gamut of ways that people are already discovering how to use this new tool. There are plenty of use cases for one to try when ChatGPT with vision becomes available to you.
Visual research with ChatGPT vision
AI enthusiast Rowan Cheung shared an image of a cave on ChatGPT and asked where it was located. ChatGPT responded by saying that – “…The image appears to be taken from inside a cave overlooking a coastline with a distinctively curving road. Based on the scenery and the characteristics of the landscape, it strongly resembles the view from Makapu’u Point on the island of Oahu in Hawaii…”
The accurate recognition prompted Cheung to tweet saying, “ChatGPT image recognition can find hidden gems.” Other users have also shared similar demonstrations on Twitter from asking for locations to identifying animals in a shot. So far, ChatGPT Vision seems to be performing well.

With the integration of this feature into mobile, this is going to be a use case that millions of users are likely to opt for. This has all the potential to be a very standard feature of travel in future. Imagine seeing something, and pointing ChatGPT at it and saying what is that or tell me about that.
ChatGPT Vision for interior design
Another AI expert, Pietro Schirano, has done numerous experiments with ChatGPT Vision. In one of his tweets, Schirano posted a picture of his room and asked how he could improve this room. ChatGPT gave a number of suggestions to enhance from colour to plants to lighting to art, etc.

Custom instructions are the feature which allows users to give ChatGPT more information about themselves so that it can have context when it responds to future queries. This is evident from the bot’s response, precisely when it makes an Art suggestion where it says, “Given your background in classical studies and art, perhaps adding some artwork on the walls could be a great personal touch. They could be prints of classical artworks or something contemporary to create a blend of old and new.”

ChatGPT Vision as an expert developer
Pietro in his demonstration also showed how ChatGPT vision can build websites and write codes. He writes code from the image to the live website using GPT-4 Vision in less than a minute. He essentially shared a video of him posting an example of UI in a photo asking ChatGPT to replicate it without skipping anything, write code that he is able to later export and get it in an IDE almost instantly.

Another user, McKay Wrigley did something similar when he gave a screenshot of a SaaS dashboard and asked the bot to write code for it. ChatGPT Vision moved from a screenshot to an actual working prototype within minutes. Wrigley later demonstrated how showing ChatGPT a picture of one’s team’s whiteboard session can be a prompt for it to write code. The video got close to 10 million views.

Reducing the gap between ideas and execution
Reading and explaining diagrams are a revolutionary aspect of ChatGPT Vision. A user identified as Sean Spriggens uses an unbelievably dense diagram which seems to be from the Pentagon titled ‘Integrated Defence Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Life Cycle Management System’. The diagram shared by Spriggens has over 3,000 words and hundreds of boxes floating across the page. However, ChatGPT is able to make sense of it. Interestingly, some diagrams are entirely different types of information.

For instance, another user Marco Moscorro posted a diagram of the electronics (schematics) of the Arduino design, and ChatGPT with Vision was instantly able to understand that it was an electronic circuit and also effortlessly explained how different components were interconnected and worked.
This is also an incredible use case for educational purposes. It is to be noted that with Vision it is just not about the initial results, users can also interact and ask for further clarifications on the diagrams that they are trying to explore. Essentially OpenAI is enabling a dialogue between man and machine. This also has a flipside, as demonstrated by another AI expert Peter Yang. He shared an image of a math test and asked ChatGPT to give answers. The chatbot responded by offering accurate answers.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Kids will never do homework again,” tweeted Yang with the image showing the response from ChatGPT. Based on this, experts feel that if teachers can work around exercises that are actually valuable for children and are something that ChatGPT cannot perform then in all likelihood those tests can be more valuable in education.
More on ChatGPT’s new features
The new voice and image functionality definitely offers a more user-intuitive interface as users can now converse with the chatbot with their voice or by simply showing images. These dynamic interactions are seen as a landmark in AI as they may come in handy in everyday conversations such as discussing places to see or dinner suggestions based on ingredients in the kitchen. Besides, the novel text-to-speech model offers human-like audio creation.
When it comes to efficacies, the web browsing feature is not consistently accurate, however, ChatGPT with vision has seemingly impressed with its real-world applications. A recent research paper also demonstrated its capabilities such as identifying manufacturing defects, producing medical scan reports, assessing vehicle damage, etc. Despite occasional errors, GPT-4 with vision means a significant shift towards a visual AI assistant. Users are recommended to try the vision features using Bing Chat and GPT-4 to enhance their tasks.
While these features are insane, OpenAI is moving ahead with caution as it is also emphasising safety and mitigating risks as it deploys them. The vision-based models are tested extensively. When it comes to accessibility, collaborations such as ‘Be My Eyes’ for the visually impaired take the feature’s utility to new heights. The AI powerhouse has stressed transparency while acknowledging possible inaccuracies in terms of images with people. The company has said that it has taken measures to ensure user privacy.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-vision-overtakes-google-bard-why-it-is-the-future-of-ai-powered-conversations-8964805/,technology
Intel hails ‘landmark’ as high-volume EUV production begins at Irish plant,"The EUV tools, which are theoretically precise enough to hit a person's thumb with a laser pointer from the moon, will play a key role in meeting Intel's goal of delivering five generations of technology in four years, the U.S. company said.","Chipmaker Intel said on Friday it had begun high-volume production using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines at its $18.5 billion plant in Ireland, calling it a “landmark” moment as it seeks to regain ground on its rivals.
Once the world’s leading chip manufacturer, Intel has lost the lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, but says it is on track to regain it with manufacturing technology it says will rival the best from the Taiwanese group.
The EUV tools, which are theoretically precise enough to hit a person’s thumb with a laser pointer from the moon, will play a key role in meeting Intel’s goal of delivering five generations of technology in four years, the U.S. company said.

Intel’s general manager of technology development Ann Kelleher told Reuters it was on track to meet this target, with two manufacturing processes now complete, a third “coming rapidly”, and the final two making very good progress.
The plant, in the town of Leixlip outside Dublin, is the first high-volume location for the group’s Intel 4 manufacturing process, which uses EUV. The technique will produce its forthcoming “Meteor Lake” chip for laptops, which will pave the way for AI PCs.
The EUV machines, made by Dutch manufacturer ASML, are as big as a bus and cost around $150 million each.
There are currently seven in the plant, where a constant stream of overhead robots, each costing the same as an average BMW car, whiz along 22km of track delivering silicon wafers from tool to tool.
ADVERTISEMENT
Kelleher said Intel expects to receive its first next-generation extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, the High-NA EUV, in Oregon later this year. The company says it will be the first chipmaker to get the machine, which is also made by ASML.
Intel typically finalises new manufacturing processes at a research and development site in the Portland suburb of Hillsboro, Oregon, before exporting the manufacturing template to other sites.
Beyond its facilities in Ireland, Intel plans to build a big chip complex in Germany and a semiconductor assembly and test facility in Poland.
The new sites will benefit from eased funding rules and subsidies in the EU as the bloc looks to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.

iPhone 15 review: The best non-Pro Apple device ever,The iPhone 15 has been my companion for the past few days. And Apple has been able to impress with just a few upgrades. Here’s why.,"With the iPhone 15, it seems, Apple has yet again seamlessly blended design, functionality, and performance. At first glance, although not radically different from the iPhone 14, this device seems to have an edge, maybe because of its camera system. In this review, we will delve deep into the nuances of the iPhone 15, its upgrades, and cameras and explore why this new Apple device has the potential to become the most popular non-pro iPhone ever.
Minimalism meets elegance
To be honest, I wasn’t really moved by the new colours on the standard models. At first, I found them to be a bit off. However, a few days later, I got the iPhone 15 in a pastel yellow. An ardent fan of all things black, this has to be the most flashy smartphone that I have ever used. To my utter surprise, I fell in love with the phone after toying around with it for a few hours. The colour, the weightlessness of it (when compared, holding my iPhone 13 Pro now feels like clutching onto a cinder block), and the ergonomics of the durable aerospace-grade aluminium chassis all felt better.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/iphone-15-review-8962907/,technology

Watch this space: Not all Chinese scientists question India’s Chandrayaan-3,"In this week's Watch this space, Sethu Pradeep writes about how a celebrated Chinese scientist questioned Chandrayaan-3's success while some other Chinese experts praised it.","The Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) massive success with the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which became the first one to land so close to the lunar south pole before going to sleep, seems to have ruffled some feathers. Chinese scientist Ouyang Ziyuan has questioned the achievements of the mission.
Ziyuan, who is lauded as the father of China’s lunar exploration program, said the Chandrayaan-3 landing site is nowhere close to the pole, reports Bloomberg.

Sony doubles down on virtual production business using its hardware muscle,"In recent decades Sony has shed struggling electronics lines to focus on games, movies and music but still makes hardware such as movie cameras.","Sony Group is increasing its focus on the virtual production business where it is seeing market-beating growth, a company executive said, riding on the strength of the Japanese entertainment conglomerate’s technology.
The business, which offers virtual production facilities to filmmakers and broadcasters, involves using a wall of light-emitting diode (LED) panels displaying images – a science-fiction landscape or a downtown cityscape – that are integrated into the scene as it is shot.
An alternative to green screens, where digital effects are added at a later stage, advantages of the system include more realistic reflections created by light from the panels and greater immersion for actors on set.

Sony sees its edge from the company’s strength in hardware – the conglomerate makes everything from image sensors for cameras to the supersized LED video walls – and moviemaking expertise as a major player in Hollywood.

“It’s because we have the hardware that we can recreate in the virtual world,” Yasuharu Nomura, Sony’s head of virtual production, said in an interview.
In recent decades Sony has shed struggling electronics lines to focus on games, movies and music but still makes hardware such as movie cameras. The company is an investor in Epic Games, whose Unreal Engine is used to generate digital environments.
Sony says its virtual production business is growing by around 35% annually, faster than the overall market, with an increasing proportion of sales expected to come from services.

The company is rolling out better panels and cameras and service options while also offering “volumetric capture”, where performances are filmed from multiple angles for viewing in virtual reality.
Virtual production technology gained attention after its use in science-fiction show “The Mandalorian” from Walt Disney , which used in-house visual effects firm Industrial Light & Magic.

Electronic Arts launches ‘FC 24’ soccer game in fresh start after FIFA split,"EA has tried to boost the appeal of ""FC 24"" with new features such as cross-platform play and HyperMotion V technology that uses data from real footage to program in-game movements.","Electronic Arts on Friday launched its first soccer game without the FIFA tag, betting its “FC 24” title will maintain the momentum in its best-selling franchise and provide a bulwark against an industry slowdown.
A near three-decade partnership between EA and FIFA ended last year over what media reports said were demands that the videogame maker double its yearly payments of $150 million to the governing body of world soccer.
That has left “FC 24” without the visibility and marketing heft the FIFA brand enjoyed. The game’s success is crucial to EA as some analysts estimate the franchise accounts for a major chunk of the company’s sales and its $32 billion market value.

“The end of such a high-profile partnership … creates an uncertain future for the publisher,” said Joost Van Dreunen, a lecturer at NYU’s Stern School of Business, in his newsletter.

“Both gamers, who fear a weakening of the franchise, and investors, worried about how it will impact EA’s ability to generate revenues, are watching closely.”
EA has tried to boost the appeal of “FC 24” with new features such as cross-platform play and HyperMotion V technology that uses data from real footage to program in-game movements.
The game’s standard edition retails for $69.99 in the United States, while the ultimate edition sells for $99.99.
ADVERTISEMENT
Analysts also believe the FIFA split should unlock a bigger marketing budget for “FC 24”, which has retained licenses to most of the soccer leagues, teams and players.
“EA spent under 10% in marketing prior to losing the FIFA name and they’re able to probably double that to 16%,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.
“I’m confident that sales won’t suffer … the company is expecting a small decline and they’re talking like 5%.”
Pachter also pointed to the strength in the franchise’s Ultimate Team game mode, which accounts for more than a billion dollar in sales annually by allowing gamers to purchase card packs to create their virtual teams.

This has helped EA at a time its other games including Apex Legends are grappling with a post-pandemic slowdown. The company missed net bookings expectations last quarter and laid off 6% of its workforce in March.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/electronic-arts-launches-fc-24-soccer-game-in-fresh-start-after-fifa-split-8963591/,technology

How to enable web browsing feature on OpenAI’s ChatGPT,"ChatGPT is one of the most advanced AI chatbots out there, and it just got better.","OpenAI has announced that ChatGPT can now browse the web within their conversations – again – with a post on X. First announced back in June, the ability was removed in just a week because it could access paid content. Called Browse with Bing, the feature uses Microsoft’s search engine to provide answers from “current and authoritative” sources, which are also linked in the responses.
Browse with Bing is currently available only for Plus and Enterprise subscribers of OpenAI, but the company says it will make it accessible to all users soon. Until now, ChatGPT was the only major AI chatbot with the lack of web access. Alternatives like Bing Chat and Google Bard have offered this functionality right from their day of launch – and for free.
