Jannik Sinner’s strong and improved baseline game helps him stun Novak Djokovic to reach Australian Open final,"Baseline strategy has been central to Jannik Sinner's game and he has been working on it with his new coaching team since the start of 2022 – led by Darren Cahill, Andre Agassi’s former coach.","In a resolute, nerveless, three-hour-long display of destructive shot making and tactical mastery, Jannik Sinner, the rising 22-year-old World No.4, defeated Novak Djokovic 6-1, 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-3 in the semifinals of the Australian Open on Friday, reaching his first Major final and becoming the first Italian man to reach the singles final in Melbourne.
Sinner outplayed and outmanoeuvred the undisputed king of Melbourne Park – and men’s tennis in general – and in doing so, not only strengthened his long-held credentials as a potential great in the making, but also achieved a feat that none of the Serb’s greatest rivals had been able to accomplish even at the peak of their careers.
Prior to Friday, 10-time champion Djokovic had never lost in the semifinal or final of the Australian Open. A perfect 20-0 record. He was 33 matches unbeaten in Melbourne, a streak that went back to 2018 – 2195 days, as the broadcasters were keen to point out every chance they got.

The Serb’s dominance of the Slams, and particularly Melbourne Park, was not simply down to extraordinary tennis repertoire, but instead part of a legacy built on a near-supernatural ability to expose best-of-five tennis for the collection of short sprints that it is, as opposed to the consistent long run marathon it has always been claimed to be.
Even when thoroughly outplayed, Djokovic has always possessed the athleticism and presence of mind to take matches deep, win the pressure points, keep himself competitive enough to give himself a chance to win the match in the finer margins.
So, Sinner’s statement-making victory was not completed during the first half of the match, when the solid Italian took advantage of a streaky-looking Djokovic to race into an early two-set lead. Instead, it was earned during the second half, when he prevented the 24-time Grand Slam champion, who raised his game to try to take the contest deep, from completing one of his signature comebacks.
Superior in all departments
Djokovic was unquestionably flat at the start of this match, and his second-half recovery was never too convincing either, similar to his level in his first five matches of the tournament. Out of 90 completed points in the first two sets, Djokovic made 29 unforced errors.
He would admit to this himself, cutting a disappointed figure in his post-match press conference. “I was, in a way, shocked with my level, in a bad way,” he said. “This is one of the worst Grand Slam matches I’ve ever played, at least that I remember… This tournament hasn’t been, as I said, up to my standard or criteria or the level that I would normally play or expect myself to play”
And Sinner was in diametrically opposite form.

Baseline strategy has formed a primary emphasis of the work he has been doing with his new coaching team – led by Darren Cahill, Andre Agassi’s former coach – since the start of 2022 and he nailed it in the biggest result of his career. The Italian’s lean, wiry frame and composed demeanour do not betray the full strength of the destructive power that comes off his racquet.
His pure ball striking ability would send Djokovic trailing to catch balls, and his aggression from start to finish allowed him to finish points before Djokovic could even get balls back into play to wear him down. Djokovic was out of sorts, but it was Sinner’s baseline prowess that had him totally out of his comfort zone, making him rush his shots and extracting errors.
Despite it not being the highlight of his game, Sinner served exceptionally – according to Opta, this is the first Grand Slam match of Djokovic’s 19-year-long career where he did not even have a single break point opportunity.

Sinner won 80 of the points when the rallies were four shots or less, as opposed to Djokovic’s 43. In the first two sets, that number is 32-16, showing just how well Sinner was serving and returning, and keeping points short to keep Djokovic out of his comfort zone.
Maintaining composure
Djokovic was subpar throughout the match, but recovered from the first two sets reasonably, he began to raise his level just enough to make sure he can take advantage if the player on the other side of the net buckled.
Lesser players would have tightened up one set away from the biggest result of their career, but Sinner’s concentration never wavered. Even as Djokovic improved, the Italian stayed true to his aggressive strategy, and served consistently well to get over the line in the pressure moments and take the third set into a tiebreaker, where Djokovic typically showed signs of life and recovered from match point down – with an expertly executed lob no less – to edge the tiebreaker. Another famous turnaround was lurking.

But Sinner never cowered, coming out in the fourth set just as he had done all match – bombing down serves, putting pressure on Djokovic through aggressive return strategy, and striking the ball as purely as he had done from the start.
It would be Djokovic who would blink. After saving two break points earlier in the set, his serve would be broken on a game in which he was 40-0 up. Anyone familiar with Djokovic’s history would be aware that the match is far from over, but Sinner served out the win with the freedom of a player that was not simply attempting to protect his lead, but outrightly going for the kill.
Ever since he was a teenager, hype has swirled around the lethal nature of his shotmaking and complete nature of his game. After growing into his body and peaking physically, Sinner’s tendency to collapse meant he needed to prove that he could hold his nerve against an all-time great opponent with the Grand Slam pressure on him. After picking up his third win in four matches against Djokovic, and reaching his first Major final, some of those doubts have surely been put to bed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/jannik-sinners-strong-and-improved-baseline-game-helps-him-stun-novak-djokovic-to-reach-australian-open-final-9129073/,sports
"Allan Border opens up about Parkinson’s disease: ‘I’m not scared, but I am worried about the slow decline process’","Former Australia captain says the disease has softened him a bit, which is embarrassing and good at the same time.","Legendary Australia cricketer Allan Border has opened up about his fight with Parkinson’s disease and revealed why he is scared about the “slow decline process.”
“My health is good apart from having Parkinson’s my general health is pretty good,” Border said on Fox Cricket’s at tea on day two of the day-night pink ball Test match played between Australia and West Indies.
“I still play golf. I still go for walks and can do all the things I normally do. I am not running any marathons anymore, but apart from that things are pretty good.”
Border, who was also the first player in history to score 11,000 Test runs, was diagnosed with the brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements in 2016.
“It is a neurological disorder where the brain stops developing a thing called dopamine, which affects muscles and your nervous system,” he explained.
Having made his national team debut in 1978, Border went on to play 156 Tests and 273 ODIs for Australia until 1994, scoring over 17,698 runs that consisted of 30 centuries. In first-class cricket, he’d score over 27,000 runs that included a staggering 70 centuries.
“I didn’t know much about Parkinson’s. The first thing that came to my mind at the time was Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic Cauldron, so I just thought, oh my god.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It was just a strange feeling and a strange trip home. My better half Jane was with me and we just thought, bloody hell what does this actually mean?”
Having skippered Australian men’s cricket team to their first world title in 1987, Border was also part of the 55 inaugural ICC Cricket Hall of Fame inductees in 2009 and is one of the two names after whom the India-Australia Test series is nomenclatured.
“I’m not so much scared, but I am worried yeah about that slow decline process,” Border said.
“I am worried about that and I have sort of taken the route that the less I know the better, where as Jane my wife has gone the other way and she knows everything.

“I do get lectured quite often about, you haven’t been for a walk for a couple of days or what are you doing drinking all those beers? And all the stuff I shouldn’t be doing.
“But I am being kept on the straight and narrow by Jane and a good medical team.”
During the chat Mark Howard also revealed the text he sent to Wasim Akram.
“It hasn’t changed me too much, I am getting a lot of good well wishes, which is embarrassing but good. I don’t know whether I have become softer in my approach to how I talk to people,” Border said.

“You sent a message to the group and to Wasim Akram telling him how much you loved him,” asked Howard.
“We were with him at the time and he was completely overwhelmed. That was a beautiful thing that AB sent through and it had a massive impact on him.”
Border laughed and spoke about the admiration, he have for Pakistan legend.
“I told him years ago that if there is reincarnation I want to come back as him. I would have been a very nasty left-arm fastbowler.” Border said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/allan-border-opens-up-about-parkinsons-disease-im-not-scared-but-i-am-worried-about-the-slow-decline-process-9128901/,sports

“He’s deservedly in the finals. He outplayed me completely,” Djokovic said after the match.
“Look, I was, in a way, shocked with my level — in a bad way. There was not much I was doing right in the first two sets.
“Yeah, I guess this is one of the worst Grand Slam matches I’ve ever played. At least that I remember.”
He hadn’t lost a match at Melbourne Park since 2018 and was on a 33-match winning streak at the season’s first major. Every previous time he’d won a quarterfinal in Australia, Djokovic had gone on to win the hardcourt title.
Sinner is in red-hot form – he has won 19 of his last 20 matches and clinched two ATP titles and the Davis Cup since October – and he had also defeated Djokovic twice in three meetings over 12 days at the back end of last year.

‘It looked like a dead lbw’: Ben Duckett on Shubman Gill surviving a close call,Duckett believes England are still in the game and they can take wickets in cluster to put India on the back foot.,"England opener Ben Duckett says Shubman Gill surviving a close call looked like a “dead lbw” and still believes that if they can take wickets in cluster to put India on the back foot.
“It feels like a tricky pitch to start on,” he told reporters.
“Shubman (Gill) there, we could have had him. It looked like a dead lbw (when he was struck on the pad by Tom Hartley) and somehow, it’s bouncing over the stumps. It’s one of those things.
“We’ll stick to our mantra and that’s taking wickets and looking to be positive. Hopefully, that will happen for us as well.”
India will resume from 119 for 1 on Day 2 and Yashasvi Jaiswal’s attacking gameplan has taken England by surprise but with pitch deteriorating quickly, England are still in the match.
“You have to pay credit to them… they played really well and were very attacking, which is positive,” he said.
“They don’t always go about it like that, so to go about it that way shows that they probably think that pitch is going to get quite a bit worse.

“That’s going to happen out here, and that’s something that we’ll have good belief in when we’re bowling,” Duckett said.
“We could easily take three or four (wickets) tomorrow morning for 10 runs.”
Despite getting bowled out on 246, the England opener feels they are in a strong position.
We are very happy being bowled out for what we got,” Duckett told BBC Sport.

“Hopefully we can take two or three wickets early [on day two] and put them under pressure.”
“We’re in a strong position, regardless of them only being one down,” he added.
Duckett lauded skipper Ben Stokes knock.
“He’s the best in the world in those situations,” said Duckett.
“The way he soaked up pressure early on, trusted his defence, then when we were eight or nine down he let loose like he does all the time. That could be a match-winning innings for us.”

England left-arm spinner Tom Hartley’s first delivery in Test cricket was hit for a six by Yashasvi Jaiswal, who is unbeaten on 76 from 70 balls.

"In crunch time, Kiran George produces an aggressive finish to beat China’s World No.19 Lu Guang Zu","As Kiran George had missed out on opportunities to go deeper into draws, his coaches at the Prakash Padukone academy in Bangalore had been drilling into him the importance of a strong, aggressive finish.","Since the start of 2023, Kiran George had played out 14 tight finishes of 21-19, 22-20 or 23-21 score lines on the world tour, and won only 8 of those. One of India’s finest bludgeons from the back court, would fall back frustratingly in the endgame as his impressive strokeplay was rendered a footnote in losses.
On Thursday, Kiran, the world No.36, literally went ballistic in finishing in the Round of 16 at Indonesia Masters, winning 21-11, 13-21, 21-18 against China’s World No.19 Lu Guang Zu.
As he had missed out on opportunities to go deeper into draws, his coaches at the Prakash Padukone academy in Bangalore – Vimal Kumar, Sagar Chopda and DK Sen, had been drilling into him the importance of a strong, aggressive finish.
Kiran’s father George Thomas, had heard it all too often, how his son wasn’t pushing the pedal when required. It was a hard watch because George, the 1991 Indian national champion, was known for his blistering pace and muscled aggression while killing off points. Kiran’s soft exits stung.
Kiran’s father George Thomas was the 1991 Indian national champion.
After Thursday’s win in three, his father couldn’t contain his pride and was relieved at how the lad had finally unleashed his full aggression to nick a tight decider his way.
The first two sets swung equally and one-sidedly in either player’s direction. But it was in the decider when Kiran was three points adrift at 8-11 that the 23-year-old came charging at Lu. The hand speed showed a visible uptick, and Kiran stalked him all the way to 18-18, not conceding more than a 1 point lead.
The last three points from 18-all were pristine aggression as first a growling net dribble, then a signature scythe shot from the back and finally a lightning reflex from midcourt, all played at breathless speed, gave the Indian World No.36 a swashbuckling win over No.19 Zu to make the quarterfinals of a Super 500.

“Kiran is far too cool on the court, don’t know if it’s a good thing or bad. I was the opposite, very aggressive. But he has far superior strokeplay,” explained George who won subjunior, and junior Nationals in doubles and the U21 and seniors singles crown, gaining domestic renown.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Yet too many times he was leading by a big margin and still lost in recent years. People would say he lacks aggression. Internationally each point counts for a lot at the end.”
Kiran had beaten Chinese Shi Yuqi and Weng Hong Yang, who caused headaches to most Indians, rather easily last June. But a deep run in a tournament was missing, as headlines proved elusive.
Kiran had beaten Chinese Shi Yuqi and Weng Hong Yang, who caused headaches to most Indians, rather easily last June. But a deep run in a tournament was missing, as headlines proved elusive.
At Istora in Jakarta by Thursday, Kiran had played 4 matches including qualifying rounds, in 72 hours. All of them, three-setters.
After blitzing to take the Round 2 opener against Lu to whom he’d lost 21-10, 22-20 last October, Kiran watched the Chinese regroup and retaliate. Lu has a strong power game, a decent defense, and got his straight hits going to pull Kiran into a decider. The Indian was defending well in the second, but not taking his chances falling back 3-11, and eventually submitting 13-21.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lu was hell bent in the decider on testing Kiran on the forehand far corner, pushing him back, because the Indian was proving too dangerous at the net. Lu underestimated just how good Kiran can be from the back court.
Not only does the Indian hit deep and hard from baseline, he has perhaps the best deception amongst Indians from the back. His long hits travel with a deep baritone. Both his slow drops and fast pushes fetch him points, even if he’s chased away from the net, where his tight dribbles aren’t bad at all.
Kiran’s repertoire of disguises and strokes from the back is classical, and the footwork moving front and back from corners to centre is so smooth and swift that he is never quite pinned to the baseline. The Chinese just couldn’t thwart Kiran merely by pinging him continually to that forehand back corner. The whip on the shuttle was audible and audacious.
Much to the chagrin of Lu, who tried to blast through, Kiran also unfurled some stinging winners struck when backtracking, showing spectacular balance on the move, as he anticipated and connected with the shuttle early. From 12-12, he was snapping at Lu’s heels, though the Chinese defense wasn’t wilting till 18-18.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lu had wins over Lee Zii Jia, Anthony Ginting and Jonatan Christie this month. But at this point, Kiran pushed the fourth gear, and didn’t take his foot off the pedal, slashing down three straight points, for a gutsy win on a day when Lakshya Sen and Priyanshu Rajawat faded off in straight sets.
At Istora in Jakarta by Thursday, Kiran had played 4 matches including qualifying rounds, in 72 hours. All of them, three-setters.
George Thomas who was on the Indian team with Padukone and admired how quietly focussed he would be, was glad Kiran had kept at it, against the big-hitting Chinese. “I’ve watched Prakash train many times, and observed how he was after wins and losses. He wouldn’t even talk around matches. Kiran is very meticulous and focussed, but he needs to keep at it till the end. The tournament is still to be won,” he said.
Pedigree & the punch
George began playing badminton on outdoor courts in Chengannur village in Alappuzha district of Kerala and was prodigiously talented. Winning straightaway at GV Raja Sports school with his strong speedy hitting, he had moved 100 km to capital Trivandrum, and continued to win, making the national camps at Patiala, where a Chinese coach honed his game ahead of the National title in 1991. His brother Suresh Thomas too played and coached at Regional Sports centre, where Kiran and his elder sibling learnt their early games.
George was known for his speed. Moving to Bangalore though, Kiran found coaching expertise and grew into a highly skilled stroke player with many variations. His drops and backcourt deception are highly evolved, but the smash kill can take two shots far too many to fetch up. It’s not a scary smash yet, strictly make-do, but Kiran has far too many variations to be tied down. “People say he doesn’t have aggression. And he’s not naturally built, the muscle strength is still not wholly developed. But his strokes are good and he’s very positive. He got a little desperate after losing Thomas Cup trials, but usually he rebounds fast after losses,” his father says.
ADVERTISEMENT
As a former player watching his son get all the technical and financial support, George says Kiran must take the next step. “He’s lucky he’s well supported. I tell him three things – stay focussed till the end, take care of your body and learn to peak for big matches. At this level, everyone has strength and fitness. But the best players know to peak in big moments.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/kiran-george-produces-aggressive-finish-to-beat-chinas-lu-guang-zu-9128103/,sports
"Sarfaraz and Musheer: Two brothers, 7,625km apart, one scored a century for India A, the other for India colts in U-19 World Cup","Father Naushad Khan gives credit to Mumbai’s khadoos cricket in both sons’ journeys, says Sarfaraz will get his India cap soon.","Naushad Khan was flooded with congratulatory messages and calls the moment he switched on his phone after landing in Mumbai. His elder son, Sarfaraz, playing for India A, had scored a first-class century against England Lions in Ahmedabad, while 7,625km away at Bloemfontein, his younger one Musheer had scored a match-winning ton in India’s 201-run win over Ireland in the U-19 World Cup.
“There are 800 unseen messages on my WhatsApp. All of them are about Sarfaraz and Musheer. I will go home and reply to each one of them,” Naushad tells The Indian Express from Mumbai.
On Wednesday, Naushad was in Hyderabad for BCCI’s annual function to collect the Madhav Rao Scindia award for the highest run-getter in Ranji Trophy. Sarfaraz was the tournament’s leading scorer with 982 runs. He has dominated India’s domestic circuit for the past three years but is still knocking on the doors of the Indian cricket team. Since 2020, he has scored more than 2,000 runs at an average of 82 but is yet to get an India call.
When asked what his son needs to do to get selected for India, Naushad smiles and says: “Just keep scoring runs.”
“I was not supposed to go for this award but since Sarfaraz had a match the next day, I had to. I am glad that I went to Hyderabad and the kind of compliments I have received about Sarfaraz has given me a confidence boost.
For his incredible century in the first-innings, Musheer Khan is adjudged the Player of the Match 👏👏#TeamIndia win by 201 runs 👌👌

“BCCI ne usey award diya aur mujhe yakeen hai BCCI usey Test cap bhi dega (BCCI has given him an award and I am sure they will give him a Test cap as well),” the proud father says.
Sarfaraz, who missed out on a century by four runs in the warm-up match against England Lions, and failed to convert his half-century in the first unofficial Test, hammered 161 off 160 balls, his first century for India A.
Musheer shows promise
In South Africa, the younger Khan, who has yet to deliver on the promise that he has shown in BCCI’s age-group competitions, scored his first century in U-19 cricket. Interestingly, Sarfaraz has a record of scoring seven fifty-plus total, the most in an U-19 World Cup, but never had a century.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the post-match presentation, Musheer said he and his brother have a “similar style of batting.” They both are busy and love to score big. Musheer struggled in the opening match against Bangladesh but showed composure in the second. He completed his half-century in 66 balls and then changed gears to score the next 50 in just 34 balls.
“I hurried a bit for runs in the last match, so I gave myself some time in this match. I got the result,” he says.
Musheer hit four sixes in his knock, all of them in the second half of his knock. His favourite was the one over mid-wicket against medium pacer Oliver Riley. The shot got him going.

“Musheer is an opener. He has got a very calm head on his shoulders. He has got the best of both games. He can change gears as per situation and conditions,” says Naushad.

“I spoke to him after the Bangladesh match. He was in good nick but was just not able to get a big one. Now the monkey is off the back. To be honest, with VVS Laxman and Hrishikesh Kanitkar around him, I don’t need to tell him anything. He is in safe hands.”
Mumbai’s khadoos cricket
The Mumbai school of batting preaches filling one’s boots when the opportunity presents itself, not throwing one’s wicket away once in. That’s what Sarfaraz in Ahmedabad and Musheer in Bloemfontein showed.
Naushad gives credit to Mumbai’s cricketing system and BCCI’s structure for the growth of both his sons.

“I have done my bit because they are my sons. But Mumbai cricket has played a bigger role in the development of their game. The khadoos cricketing culture of Mumbai has made them hungry for runs,” he says.

“In Mumbai, they are used to playing two-day and three-day games from a very young age and by the time they get to the NCA (National Cricket Academy), they are ready to play higher-level cricket. The BCCI’s structure is also so robust that if you work hard, you can dominate the tournaments consistently.
“There is a lot of cricket. They play U-14s, U-16s, U-19s, U-23s and then for the senior team. Not to forget all the different formats as well. A coach can work on the players but it is the structure that takes them to different levels,” explains Naushad.
Tour down memory lane
Naushad gets emotional while talking about his journey. Back in 2014, he had watched his eldest son Sarfaraz make his India U-19 debut with an eight-year-old Musheer on his lap. Almost a decade later, both his sons scored centuries on the same day but he couldn’t watch it. The India A match is not on television, while he was on a flight when Musheer reached the three-figure mark.
“I will watch their batting videos in the morning,” he laughs.

Over the years, Naushad has spent hours dishing out throw-downs, and has travelled across the country with his sons just to play matches. He couldn’t help himself turning nostalgic while talking about the journey.

“Maine pehle hi bol diya tha unko achha baap chahiye ya achha coach (I have asked both of them at a very early age whether they want a father or a good coach),” he reminisces.
“I am a very punctual guy. For me, time is money. I get up early in the morning, I sleep on time. I avoid going to family functions. I have followed this routine for years now and the only reason is that in the morning they (his sons) shouldn’t miss their practice,” he says.

"Australian Open: Jannik Sinner can match Novak Djokovic in his game, but can he emulate the Serb’s appetite for the big stage?","Italian has beaten World No.1 in two their last three meetings, but the legend is usually at his best late in a Grand Slam.","For Novak Djokovic, hunting a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title, the biggest threat in the main draw of the Australian Open may not have been a rematch of his epic five-set Wimbledon final defeat to 20-year-old Spanish phenomenon Carlos Alcaraz. The highly-anticipated potential semifinal between Djokovic, the greatest tennis player on the big stage, and Jannik Sinner, the 22-year-old World No. 4 from Italy on an unparalleled hot streak, is now a reality, as well as a small headache for the World No. 1.
Friday’s semifinal has the potential to be a seminal moment in Sinner’s career. Not only is he in red-hot form – he has won 18 of his last 19 matches and clinched two ATP titles and the Davis Cup since October – but he has also defeated Djokovic twice in three meetings over 12 days at the back end of last year.
Sinner beat Djokovic in a three-set epic in their group-stage match at the ATP season-ender, but Djokovic got his revenge in the final. When they met in the Davis Cup the week after, Sinner prevailed in extraordinary fashion, saving two match points and making Djokovic unusually buckle under pressure.
Djokovic’s tendency to raise his level in big moments, Sinner’s form, and the pair’s three recent meetings only heighten the anticipation, and give plenty away regarding where this match can be won and lost.

Backhand mismatch
For so long has Djokovic used his backhand to flatten out opponents and isolate their weaknesses that he has increasingly relied on it as a comfortable rally option, which is not the case when facing the heaviest backhand on the tour.
Rev-for-rev, Sinner’s backhand is not only more powerful than most on tour, but it is an extremely versatile option from the baseline. Among the many improvements that have come in his game after he started working with coach Darren Cahill – including an improved serve and better fitness – baseline strategy has been refined more than anything else. The Italian uses his pure shot-making to push opponents into awkward positions and open up the court to put the ball away. His backhand down the line is the most useful option for winners, but his backhand crosscourt is the most useful rally weapon.

Djokovic fell for this in the first of their three meetings in November, allowing Sinner to dictate with his backhand crosscourt, contending but eventually succumbing to the power Sinner’s pure ball striking tends to create. He solved this problem in their next match that he won in the same week, bringing his forehand into play as an attacking strategy, and staying aggressive, not passive, from the baseline.
This match may well be defined by how much Djokovic is able to keep Sinner preoccupied on his forehand side, and how often the Serb goes for the gutsier backhand down-the-line as opposed to bashing it out in long crosscourt rallies.

Many aspects of both their playing styles may make this match live up to the hype. Sinner is a pure ball striker, Djokovic can absorb pressure and turn defence into offence. Sinner has an improved serve, Djokovic is an elite returner. Sinner has superior athleticism and footspeed, Djokovic has greater variety.

Djokovic’s greatest strength is his appetite for the big stage. The Serb has been far from his best in Melbourne so far, so count on him to raise his level for a big match, and even when he is being outplayed, he will once again pull out all the stops to stay alive in a match and drag his opponent to pressure moments and wait for them to blink.
But during his burst of form in the past six months, Sinner has shown composure even under immense pressure. In five matches at the Australian Open so far, he has won 26 of the 28 break points he has faced. In the quarterfinal against Andrey Rublev, he won the second set tiebreaker despite trailing 2-5. Both his recent wins against Djokovic came after he was put under the pump – the first in a deciding set tiebreak, and the second after being double match point down. According to the ‘Under Pressure’ leaderboard, official stats collected by the ATP say Sinner is the second-best player under pressure behind Djokovic, thanks in most part to him having saved 70 percent of break points he has faced.

IND vs ENG: How India’s batsmen capitalised on England’s callow bowling group,"With just one seamer, a spin pair with an experience of one game, Jaiswal made merry of England’s inexperience.","At the end of Day One, of a series that promises plenty of thrills and twists, Yashasvi Jaiswal, with an unbeaten 76 off 70 deliveries, has opened up a glaring hole in England’s set-up that has the potential to bury them down. Their inexperience.
Two of their three spinners with a combined experience of just one Test before this are not showing sufficient signs of complimenting Jack Leach, whose control alone may not be enough for them to get the job done, particularly on a pitch that is on the slower side. How much their decision to go without a second seamer could cost them only time will tell, but India have, so far, made full use of it.
Having restricted England to 246 on what is probably the most batting friendly surface in recent times (barring the one in Ahmedabad against Australia, which played out a draw), India’s response seems to suggest they want to bat just once and big. With 119/1 on board, and still trailing by 127 runs, a big first innings lead, which England cannot swat away quickly, will be India’s primary target on Day 2. If not, there is enough time in the Test for scripting comebacks. While the pitch at Hyderabad was not as hostile as it was in Nagpur, Delhi or Indore last year, in the Australia series, it is expected to undergo wear and tear as the game progresses. Batting last in India, as you would know, comes with its own risk.
READ | India vs England 1st Test: How Bazball played out amidst the craft and cunning of India’s spin trio
Axar Patel, who grabbed two wickets, including a ripper to dismiss Jonny Bairstow, summed up the pitch and outlined India’s plans. “They made 246 and we know that the wicket was good. There is spin but the wicket is slow and we know that we did well to restrict them to 246,” he said. “We will look to bat long and then runs will be taken care of. I don’t think the pitch is having any excessive spin, it’s just normal spin. As I said the pitch is slow and we can adjust to it as the ball is getting slow after pitching. It is a bit challenging as well for the batters but if you bat well then you can make runs here. It is challenging for bowlers as well because the outfield is quick here and you can go for runs if you err in line and length even slightly,” he added.
Purpose and intent
India’s response has been commendable so far. In the 23 overs they batted, they were all purpose and showed the intent that was needed to make full use of the good work their bowlers put in. With Wood being the lone seamer – Ben Stokes won’t be bowling because he has just recovered from a leg injury – he had to be on the dot and there was no room for error. But a gifted length delivery first up allowed Jaiswal to start with a boundary before he welcomed Tom Hartley to Test cricket with a six wide of long-on.

Four balls later, he swept him over the ropes. On such pitches, spells with the new ball tend to make a difference, but Wood – taking the new ball for the first time since 2015 – continued to be wayward, sending an eight-ball over in his second that hardly troubled Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma. As Hartley conceded 13 more of his second over, Ben Stokes would ultimately turn to Leach to find some control as early as the fifth over.
It was a fascinating approach from India, who despite wanting to bat long and big, were in the mood to take on the attack. This wasn’t mindless slogging, but a calculative approach, where they targeted the inexperienced spinners, not letting them settle down on a line and length, using the feet when needed to put pressure. The only mistake that India made with the bat was when Rohi tried to dish out the same punishing treatment to Leach, but managed only to mistime it as far as Stokes at mid-on. It led to a few nervy moments with Shubman Gill surviving a close LBW call, as even Jaiswal took pedal off a bit to limit any further damage.

India vs England 1st Test: How Bazball played out amidst the craft and cunning of India’s spin trio,"England end Day One behind India, but only after producing an effective account of their bravado approach on a turning track.","More than the roar from the 24,000 odd spectators and the jubilant celebrations in the middle, it was the sigh of relief from the Indian players at the fall of every England batsman that defined Day 1 of the first Test. It was a day where England’s aggressive approach lived up to its hype until their charismatic captain Ben Stokes (70 off 88) fell as the last wicket.
A first innings total of 246 is definitely not the most damaging one—India have already sped to 119/1—that the Babzallers had inflicted on the opposition. However, on a turning track, in conditions where their approach was untested against three world-class spinners, it was as enterprising as it was anywhere else. This was not at all a bad beginning, though the challenge would be to prolong it a bit more.
This approach of England suited perfectly to the conditions that India threw up. They had more reasons to rely on it, as it gave them the best chance of putting as many runs on board before they were undone by India’s attack. Nothing illustrated it more than the dismissal of Jonny Bairstow. Having built a nice, steady partnership with Joe Root and despite living dangerously on a few occasions, the duo was beginning to concern India when Axar Patel delivered one with Bairstow’s name on it.
Bairstow did everything he had to the one that angled from Axar’s hands. A forward stride, bat placed before the pad, it was the classical stuff. But Axar – who had only picked three wickets in the four Tests against Australia – had found the right pace to bowl on this surface. It landed and spun viciously to hit the top of off. Maybe Bairstow’s forward stride could have been a bit longer. But against India’s spinners. who keep altering their length, moving front and back almost every alternate ball, looking to survive and score runs needs extraordinary application and a bit of luck.
When such deliveries were bound to come all day along, England were not going to just hang in and bat time. With their approach, it made for a contest, with blows being exchanged constantly. Given the inexperience of their spin attack, the only way England could put some sort of pressure on India was to put up a good total. Winning the toss and batting first, they went in pursuit of it. With the early morning moisture making it for a placid track, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett got the day going with a flurry of boundaries.
The right-left combination sets the tempo and with nothing alarming on the pitch, they freed their arms when they intended. India’s fielders hardly moved when the ball raced past them. Not once during the new-ball spell of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj did they swing across the line. With good bounce on offer, they played through the line. Even when Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin came on, they didn’t panic. A paddle sweep and a conventional sweep fetched two boundaries for Duckett off Jadeja.

Wrestling back control
From there on, Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar took over, keeping the Bazball in check, but giving due respect to it. Having bowled to Duckett without a fielder at cover during the 2016 series, that Ashwin started with one to the left-hander, with protection for a reverse-sweep and a paddle-sweep, showed the well-studied plans of India’s spinners. With a dark dry patch on either side, and the pitch getting baked under the bright sun, they found turn and bounce as Jadeja got rid of Ollie Pope with Rohit Sharma completing a low catch at slips. When Crawley was caught at mid-off off Ashwin, England had lost three wickets in 21 balls.

All eyes were now on how Root and Bairstow would respond. For a side that never seemed to take the pedal off the feet even when wickets fell in a heap previously, here they played the moment, but not once did they drift away from their approach. Be it playing shots or defending, they stuck to their plan, which has worked for them so far.

As Dinesh Karthik has told this daily, Bazball’s ethos is not just about aggressive approach, but to do everything you do with absolute conviction. Similar to how India’s spinners gave due respect, the experienced England reciprocated respect to Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar. Of course, they created opportunities to score boundaries, but at the same time they also defended them with confidence, in a bid to alter their plans. From there it became a battle of patience on either side of lunch before Axar found a way to beat Bairstow.
From there on, Stokes took it upon himself after Root fell a couple of overs later, top-edging a sweep off Jadeja to short fine-leg. He is their perennial man for crisis. He is the sort of player whose approach India have been wary of. Capable of riding the storm or counter-attacking his way out of trouble or shielding the tail and single-handedly playing a game-changing knock, Stokes can do it all with aplomb. When Ben Foakes departed with scoreboard reading 137/6 and a long tail to follow, another opposition in India was on the verge of falling way short of a total that could keep them in the game.

But Stokes would leave his stamp on the game. With Rehan Ahmed, debutant Tom Hartely and Mark Wood playing their part, Stokes would hang in. He would even let Ahmed and Hartley swing for the trees as he hung on waiting for the moment to unleash. Perhaps he was waiting for the challenge to get even harder. He then switch-hit Jadeja for his first boundary, off the 53rd ball he faced.

"India vs England: Why is it nearly impossible to score big runs against R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel on turning tracks",Former England left-arm spinner Monty Panesar explains to The Indian Express what makes the Indian spin trio more potent compared to bowling units of the visitors,"Monty Panesar’s wicket of Sachin Tendulkar in the 2012 series is probably a dream dismissal for any spinner. The ball pitched on the middle stump and turned sharply to hit the top of the off-stump, while the batter was trying to work the ball on the leg side. The ball after pitching fizzed through giving the batter no time to adjust. The speed gun read 95.4 KPH.
“I think when you are bowling quicker and bowling a good delivery the batter then neither commits forward or back which makes it difficult,” Panesar told The Indian Express. This is where the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been lethal in home conditions. Though there is help from the pitches the Indian trio has been quicker through the air not giving the batters enough time to adjust and then an error in judgment in either picking lines or lengths makes them near impossible to face.
“You can see that Jadeja always bowls quickly early in his spell to get into his spell and afterwards changes the pace,” said Panesar. In addition to bowling quicker through the air Indian spinners tend to be hitting the stumps consistently. “They are going to bowl wicket-to-wicket. I think 35-40 per cent of the deliveries will hit the wickets,” adds the 41-year-old.
Why can’t visiting spinners replicate what Indian spinners do?
Though there is a blueprint for spinners to bowl when in India, which is to bowl quicker through then reaping rewards has been few and far between. “When they are bowling quicker you lose shape (ability to bowl above the batter’s eye line and creating a doubt if he has to come forward or not) on the ball if you want to bowl quicker you still need to have shape on it.”
When bowling quickly spinners might also lose their accuracy resulting in bowling boundary bowls and not letting the pressure pile on Indian batters hence bowling slower balls is preferable for many spinners as it tends to give more control. “When you bowl a bit slower you can get good shape on the ball.” However, Panesar reckons the problem that it brings is that when the ball is slower, the batter has that extra time to adjust even if he misreads the delivery.
“Even if you beat them in the air because there is not much pace of the wicket on Indian pitches even if it spins one can adjust,” he says.

Rishabh Pant’s 91 in the first Test in Chennai 2021 though in a losing cause typified the approach the Indian batters tend to take against the visiting spinners. While there was rough outside the off-stump of the left-hander, every time Jack Leach tried to land the ball on the spot Pant would dance the track and hit him for a maximum not letting the spinner settle down. “Thought I was playing in the IPL!” Leach hilariously said at the time. “As a spinner, you have to expect that at times. But I’m never going to enjoy 8 overs for 80,” he added.
Panesar believes that the aggression shown by Indian batters tends to put a lot of pressure on spinners. “They don’t want the spinners to bowl with a good shape on it, good dip, good drop. That’s the danger ball for the Indian batters. So they will come after you so that you fire it in, just bowl into the pitch and don’t put that shape on it. And it is easier to pick the length and then they will milk you all day.”

Kevin Pietersen’s 186 in Mumbai is arguably one of the best counter-attacking innings a visiting batter has played on Indian soil. The batter made 338 runs at an average of 48.29 back then. While he was looking to take on the spinners, the inexperience of Ashwin and tired legs of Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha had no answer to the assault throughout the series.

Fast forward over a decade, there has been significant change. Joe Root is technically one of the sound batters against spin bowling.

However, post that the batter was not allowed to sweep at all. “The sweep shot is a lot easier when the spinner bowls it a bit slower.

Sathiyan focusing on mixed doubles with Manika Batra in Olympics lead-up as singles too tough,"However, training time with Manika limited as both have separate schedules and academies.","A WTT Star Contender held in India is where star paddler G Sathiyan would normally want to give his all and take advantage of home comforts to reach the tournament’s later rounds and improve his world ranking.
Since 2019, he’s been driven to maintain his place among the top 50 in the world, with entering the top 20 his ultimate target.
On Wednesday at the WTT Star Contender Goa at the Peddem Indoor Stadium in Mapusa though, there was a shock in store for him. He’s used to being in the main draw of singles events, but low ranking meant he had to go through qualifying after not getting a wildcard. He won his first round of qualifiers, but then suffered a shock 3-2 (7-11, 11-7, 6-11, 11-7, 8-11) loss to World No.194 Vincent Picard in a topsy-turvy match.
Normally, he would be distraught after such a loss, but Sathiyan just shook off the disappointment, came to the practice arena, and asked his mixed doubles partner, India’s top-ranked women’s paddler Manika Batra, when she was free to train.
“I’m definitely giving more importance to mixed doubles in the lead-up to the Olympics. It’s ok that my singles ranking has been going down,” said Sathiyan, who has dropped to World No. 94.
The Olympics have mixed doubles as a separate category and the Sathiyan-Manika pair, ranked No.11 in the world, is poised to qualify for the Paris Games. Ever since they started playing together in 2021, they’ve had a phenomenal run, beaten top opponents, and even reached as high as World No.5 at one point. It makes them serious medal contenders in the French capital.
“We have a fair chance and an Olympic medal is an Olympic medal. You win that and it could change the face of the game. I wanted to focus on mixed doubles more where we have a chance in Paris. So Manika and I are trying hard. We aren’t in great shape right now but know that one win can change anything. Two wins in Paris and we win a medal. Right now my goal is that,” Sathiyan told The Indian Express.
Right after Olympics!

He also has no qualms in admitting that he’s choosing mixed doubles over singles as he doesn’t stand a chance of medalling in the latter event.

“To be honest, it will be very difficult to win a medal in singles. I’ve participated once, maybe I could go two rounds further but still, you are two to three rounds away from a medal chance. I have to accept I am not as physically strong as the top athletes. My game is not that high yet and so it’s better I concentrate on something where I stand a chance at winning,” he said.
The conundrum
Though he’s nursing knee and lower back injuries and physiotherapists have advised him to rest, Sathiyan says that the World Table Tennis (WTT) calendar has become so packed that taking a break could hurt his chances of qualifying. That’s why he is only choosing to play mixed doubles at top-tier events instead of trying to improve his singles ranking.
“I missed a lot of WTT Feeder events – which could’ve been beneficial for my singles ranking — in favour of playing mixed doubles at Contender and Star Contender events. I had to take a call as my body isn’t allowing me to play everything,” he says.

While Sathiyan has given up hope of qualifying in singles, Manika is likely to make it to the main draw of the Olympics and has to continue playing top events to keep her spot. It means they barely get any time to train together but Sathiyan says it’s imperative they find a way to do so.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We’ve barely trained together for a total of 15 days in the last year. We’re trying to have a more robust training schedule. It’s not that easy because she has a personal coach and I also have mine. We have occasions when we’ve trained together in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai. Right now, all we can manage is short camps of 4-5 days,” he says, adding that having a national centre where they can train anytime would be hugely beneficial for the national team. It would allow them to train with their partners whenever they want rather than having to coordinate with their respective academies and coaches to book training slots.

The only time Sathiyan and Manika get to train together is during tournaments and they try to make the most of it. “It’s what the Chinese, Japanese and Korean pairs do and we’re trying to do the same because in doubles you require a lot more coordination as we have to alternate our shots,” he says.
They’ve come far taking advantage of Manika’s pimpled rubber against top players who weren’t accustomed to playing against it and returned tamely, with Sathiyan then killing off the point with his ferocious forehand.

"Australian Open 2024: New doubles No.1 Rohan Bopanna credits composure, ‘Iyengar’ yoga, focus on recovery for reaching summit at age 43","Bopanna would become the fourth Indian - after Sania Mirza, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi - to become doubles World No.1.","At the end of the 2022 season, with Rohan Bopanna well into his forties with his career seemingly having seen its peak, there were not many options left in the locker room for the doubles veteran to pick a partner. As he puts it, the collaboration with Australia’s Matthew Ebden, at a similar crossroads in his career, was born out of both necessity and a mutual connection.
The duo became an instant hit, not only revitalising their careers, but also taking each other to the summit of the sport. On Wednesday, after their straight-sets win over the sixth-seeded Argentinian pair of Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni, Bopanna became the oldest World No.1 in history at the age of 43, taking the top spot in the men’s doubles rankings for the first time in his career. Ebden will be right behind him with the same number of ranking points but fewer tournaments played, when the updated list appears on Monday.
The duo’s latest achievements follow a landmark 2023, when they won the Indian Wells Masters and reached four other Masters finals, culminating in the US Open final they lost despite leading by a set.
Bopanna-Ebden may not be the most typical of pairings, but where their playing styles are most complementary, according to the man from Coorg, is the laid-back composure with which they handle pressure situations.
Age is just a number but ‘Number 1’ is not just another number.
Congratulations Rohan! Being the oldest World Number 1 in Men’s Doubles is a stellar feat. #AusOpen #AO2024 pic.twitter.com/5rEBxdl1km
— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) January 24, 2024
“The biggest strength is that both of us are very calm on court, no matter what the situation is. That comes in with a lot of experience, He’s (Ebden) been playing a long time, competing at a high level and winning Grand Slams,” Bopanna told reporters from Melbourne on Tuesday. “He understands the value of the right kind of strategy for these kinds of matches. We have been able to combine our mental strengths to win tough, close matches.”
And true to form in their latest match at least, the Indo-Australian duo never buckled under pressure in their nearly two-hour-long win that was trickier than the scoreline suggested. It was a fleeting opportunity in the fifth game of the first set on Gonzalez’s serve when they found the break. From there, they looked unfazed, suffering just one break point for the rest of the match, consistently applying pressure on their opponents’ serves even if they could not fashion another break, and not buckling during the second-set tiebreaker to round out the 6-4, 7-6 (5) win.
Keeping at it
Bopanna would become the fourth Indian – after Sania Mirza, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi – to become doubles World No.1.
“Extremely proud of the fact that I have been able to complete my dream,” Bopanna would later say. “It has been a little over a decade since I was World No.3. So truly proud to have made it happen.”
Age is just a number & no one proves it better than Bopsy😍🥳

— SAI Media (@Media_SAI) January 24, 2024
The Indian, a veteran of more than 40 Davis Cup ties, is full of pride that most of his achievements these days are prefixed with the word ‘oldest’.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Nobody reaches the World No.1 ranking without consistency. It’s not an overnight achievement. It always comes after successive tournaments, doing well week in, week out. That’s what I was able to do in 2023,” he said.
Bopanna says his late-career resurgence, aided by an adoption of ‘Iyengar’ yoga and dedicated focus on recovery, has led to more consistent results than he has ever had in his career.
“You need to be disciplined as an athlete,” the 43-year-old said. “For example, the first day I landed in Australia was January 4. Since then, till today, every single day I have gone and taken an ice bath, whether it is after practice or a match or whatever. Because at my age, recovery is a major aspect before anything else comes into play. Having access to these things, to physios, the improvements in sports science, all have made a massive difference in my career.”
World No.1 ranking in tow, Bopanna will qualify for the Paris Olympics if he keeps his place in the top 10 of the rankings over the next six months, ensuring Indian representation in tennis at the Summer Games that seems unlikely otherwise.

India vs England: Can Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer fill the void left by Virat Kohli?,"IND vs ENG: In Kohli’s absence, it’s even important for them to shoulder responsibility and score big runs","On Tuesday, Shubman Gill was named India’s men cricketer of 2023. On Wednesday, a day before India’s first Test against England, he turned up for a full-on nets session at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. It’s a rare sight because most first-eleven regulars skip the match-eve practice session. Mostly, only the back-ups turn up, more in the hope of an opportunity opening up at the last minute.
But few batsmen in India’s line-up, weakened by the absence of Virat Kohli, would be as under pressure as Gill could be. So he slogged for a good couple of hours in the nets under the unusually searing January sun. After starting off against seamers, he quickly shifted to facing the spinners (all net bowlers). Having struggled in the past against off-spinners, he would seek one out and instruct him to bowl a bit slower through the air as he alternated between attack and defence. There were times when he was beaten on the outside edge.

A source in India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) confirmed that Bashir had been granted a visa on his return to the United Kingdom. It is also learnt that the reason his application got cleared much later than the other members of the England team was his Pakistani origin.

Several factors have contributed to this astonishing run over the last decade, including favourable pitches, bowlers who knew how to exploit those tracks and batters who churned out runs like popcorn from a vending machine.

India vs England: Ben Stokes picks three spinners in playing XI for 1st IND vs ENG Test in Hyderabad,Ben Foakes will be playing as the wicket-keeper and Jonny Bairstow will replace Harry Brook in the middle order,"England announced their playing eleven for the first Test at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad a day before the Test. The visitors have picked three spinners in their lineup and one pacer in Mark Wood. Left-arm spinners Jack Leach and Tom Hartley addition to leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed are included in the playing eleven.
Monty Panesar speaking to this Newspaper would rate young Hartley highly and compare him to Axar Patel, “He’s a similar bowler to Axar. He is more of a roller. Axar knows he doesn’t have to put much spin on it. He looks to set the batter up to the non-turning delivery. And then you’ll get the odd one because his seam is slightly squarer, he’ll get that ball to bite that little bit. Not as sharp as Jadeja. That’s why they complement each other. One’s tall, the other one is a bit shorter.”

“It’s been an incredible 20 years playing this tournament week in, week out, and today, reaching the No 1 ranking, it’s an extremely amazing and proud feeling. It probably hasn’t sunk in fully yet but still credit to the entire team. These last 13 months have been an incredibly consistent kind of a year. I am proud to be where I am today, at the ranking of no. 1. So, India needed this, Indian tennis needed this. I am really happy to be representing India across the world in this tennis journey. There’s so much love and support from the entire country for two decades. I am thankful for all the support. I think, this is from my side, giving back to everyone in India,” Bopanna was quoted as saying after his quarter-final victory.
“World No.1 looks good on you, Bopsy. Thanks for always inspiring us,” tweeted Sumit Nagal, who himself scripted history at the ongoing Australian Open after reaching the second round by defeating 27th seed Alexander Bublik, thereby becoming the first Indian since Ramesh Krishnan in 1989 to beat a seeded player in the singles main draw of a Grand Slam.
In the past, Bopanna has claimed the mixed doubles title at the French Open in 2017 partnering Canada’s Gabriela Dabrowski. But in men’s doubles at Grand Slams, he has come close to securing it twice, before narrowly missing out: he was the runner-up at the US Open in 2010 with Pakistan’s Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and with Ebden last year (where he had become the oldest-ever Grand Slam finalist).

The final 10 minutes of the game were a sight to behold – eerily similar to how the curtain came crashing down for the men’s football team at the Asian Games. It was a group of 11 chasing, harrying and finally winning the ball, only to have every good idea come to naught with no final ball and an end product. The lack of options when presented with the ball and helplessness at the continental level has been a resounding theme around the two teams Igor Stimac has taken to the two big assignments at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024.

IND vs ENG: Rajat Patidar joins Test squad in place of Virat Kohli for England series,Rajat Patidar joins Test squad in place of Virat Kohli for England series,"With Virat Kohli missing the first two Tests, India have called up Rajat Patidar to the squad. The middle-order batsman has already linked-up with the Indian team in Hyderabad and even attended the BCCI Annual Awards on Tuesday evening.
After Kohli requested a break for the first two Tests citing personal reasons, all eyes were on the selection committee as to who they will name as a replacement. Though Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul will make India’s middle-order in the first Test, there was no other back up batsman in the squad in case of a last minute injury or to use as a concussion substitute.

Australian Open 2024: Can in-form Jannik Sinner clutch up for ultimate Novak Djokovic test?,The 22-year-old Italian continued his flawless tournament with a straight-sets win over Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinal,"Among the many storylines surrounding the Australian Open this year, it has relatively slipped under the radar that Jannik Sinner, the 22-year-old World No. 4 from Italy, is the most in-form player in the world.
His 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-3 win over the fifth-seeded Russian Andrey Rublev on Tuesday was his 18th victory in the last 19 matches, which has included a talismanic Davis Cup win for his country. He has stormed through this tournament’s draw without dropping a set, and suffering only two breaks of serve.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/australian-open-2024-can-in-form-jannik-sinner-clutch-up-for-ultimate-novak-djokovic-test-9124542/,sports
"IND vs ENG: ‘No ultra-attacking, our batsmen are attacking by nature,’ says Rahul Dravid on Bazball","While India may not adopt an ultra-aggressive approach, their bowlers will definitely be tested by one from England.","Ahead of Test series it is quite common to hear about coaches speaking about batting approaches. Some demand them to show intent. Some back their players to go aggressive. There are instances where they are told to be bold. And then there is the entire Bazball approach, which has even managed to find a place in Collins dictionary. As India are set to embrace the Bazball challenge at home starting Thursday, India head coach Rahul Dravid’s message to the batting group was rather simple: play to the situation.
Ever since Bazball took Test cricket by storm, other teams have been faced with this question as to whether they would be tempted to adopt the same approach. With India set to roll out turners — where invariably a ball with your name on it could arrive any moment – adopting an aggressive approach with the bat has helped batsmen get out of jail. In fact, last time England visited India, Rohit Sharma’s century in the first innings at Chennai (second Test) proved to be a game-changer.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-no-ultra-attacking-our-batsmen-are-attacking-by-nature-says-rahul-dravid-on-bazball-9124487/,sports
"Monty Panesar explains how tall offspinner Shoaib Bashir, Axar-clone Tom Hartley, attacking Rehan Ahmed fit into England’s Bazball tactics","With just one Test match under their belt, Bashir, Hartley and Ahmed arrive in India to partner Jack Leach with Bazball's initiation to spin bowling","One. That’s the grand total of Test matches Rehan Ahmed, Shoaib Bashir and Tom Hartley have played between each other. The first class outings of the trio doesn’t even add up to 40. And yet, it is them that England have entrusted – alongside Jack Leach – for the most daunting challenge in all of bilateral cricket – a Test series in India. This, against a team which has Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel in attendance.
Former England spinner Monty Panesar, who played a crucial hand with 17 wickets in England’s triumphant Test series in India in 2012, reckons playing in these conditions may also be the greatest advantage for the novice spinners. And that it would fit in with the Bazball plan.

IND vs ENG: Why KS Bharat fits the bill as wicketkeeper for England Test series at home,"Fast and safe hands, agility and experience of keeping in Tests at home makes him the ideal specialist for the five-match Test series against England","In 2019, more than a year after Rishabh Pant made his debut, as South Africa came visiting, India sprung a surprise. At Visakhapatnam, they drafted in another wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha ahead of Pant. Saha hadn’t played a Test for 20 months. On turning pitches, where the ball can do all sorts of tricks, they valued the primary skills of Saha over what Pant offered with the bat. With their spinners capable of creating plenty of chances they didn’t want any of them to go begging.
And five years later, despite a new team management and captain in place, in the pearl city of Hyderabad, India are fully valuing the gem of a wicketkeeper they have in KS Bharat.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-why-ks-bharat-fits-the-bill-as-wicketkeeper-for-england-test-series-at-home-9124188/,sports

IND vs ENG: India enter Bazball Universe with concerns about efficacy of turning tracks,"As the Bazball lands in India, with the first Test set to begin on Thursday in Hyderabad, all things point out to why the series could be the most challenging one for India.","It has been nearly 12 years since India lost a Test series at home. Since Alastair Cook’s England rallied to defeat them 2-1 in a four-match series, India have won 16 on the bounce – a feat that not even the all-conquering West Indies and Australia sides of the past – could come close. For 12 years, with a core of their XI remaining intact, they have looked truly invincible, having lost only three Tests at home. Beginning with Michael Clarke in 2013 to Pat Cummins in 2023, 14 captains have made attempts to win a series here. And among them only Steve Smith, Joe Root and Cummins have at least managed to win a Test here.
As the Bazball lands in India, with the first Test set to begin on Thursday in Hyderabad, all things point out to why the series could be the most challenging one for India. Like in 2012, when Andy Flower and Cook masterminded a sensational series win, defeating the hosts in their own game, India are a team in transition. And for the first two Tests in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, they will also be without Virat Kohli, meaning they will have the combined experience of their No 3, 4, 5, 6 will be only 86 Tests. And making it the most complicated for them is the Bazball approach from England, which is making them ponder over a lot.
While India have mostly preferred to play on turners since the World Test Championship came into picture, ahead of the England series there is an element of doubt if they stick to the same formula. Under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, England have binned all conventions associated with Test cricket. The concept of following something just because it has been the norm before doesn’t exist in the Bazball universe.
Despite breaking barriers, there are already questions flying from all directions in the Old Blighty if England are stretching it too far. For a series of this significance, they landed in India only on Sunday night and have just three training sessions before they take the field in Hyderabad. In Bazball universe, all the preparations for a gruelling India tour happened at Abu Dhabi from mid-January.
There is a rationale, not just bravado behind it. They feared that India might serve batting tracks with a second-string attack against them in practice games. And even if there was a turning track, it’s said that they feared the scenario where batsmen get out cheaply without facing many balls and are mopping around on the field without much practice. Instead, in Abu Dhabi, they have gone about training on custom-made tracks, working on a batting routine they hope to adopt in the Tests.
Plenty of questions for India
In the 24 matches since McCullum took over and has redefined how England play Test cricket, they have an overall strike-rate of 75.48 with the bat. In the same period, India’s is 54.57 and Australia 54.14.
This approach, where England’s batting unit never takes the pedal off, has put opposition bowlers off guard. The noise and buzz around it only adds to their aura. From having just one win out of 17 before McCullum and Stokes took charge, they have now won 13 in the next 18, including three in Pakistan and one in New Zealand. So this isn’t confined to home. Of course, the upcoming five in India will be a stern test, especially in conditions where the Bazball is yet to be tested.

And it is this unknown element that is making India fret a bit. They are blinded as to what to expect and are huddled in conversations. All things point to India playing on a turner in Hyderabad, but it is understood that this could well turn into a series where the hosts will take stock match after match. While India will heavily rely on the spin trio of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, unlike the past there are deliberations if playing on turners could close the gap between the two sides, especially given India’s brittle middle-order.
On turning pitches, apart from toss becoming a crucial factor, it is one quick-fire innings from a batsman that has proved to be a big difference. It is the approach that even India’s batsmen are known to take on such conditions before they rely on the trio of spinners to do their job with the bat. However, with this high-risk game being England’s bread and butter, with their No 1 to No 11 following it to the T, there is more reason to be fearful of this approach as the game could unravel far more quickly than India have experienced at home.

With all the venues having black soil pitches, for now India believe the lack of bounce and pace off the pitch could keep England’s batting in check. Such tracks where the batting unit have to force the pace could also unsettle England’s plans of playing taller batsmen – long reach against spinners – to an extent.
There were even deliberations whether India should go back to their traditional flat decks, which they used to great success during the 2016/17 season where they defeated New Zealand, England and Australia. But even that comes with its own risk element, especially with Bazball. Apart from toss being a factor as batting last on a deteriorating surface could be quite risky, the Bazball has thrived especially in such conditions. Even back home in England, they have moved on from playing on green tracks, instead opting for flat decks that suit England’s stroke-makers.

“I don’t really relate to the term Bazball,” Jasprit Bumrah would tell Guardian. “But they are playing successful cricket and the aggressive route of taking the opposition on, showing the world there’s another way to play Test cricket. As a bowler, what I think is that it keeps me in play. And if they’re going for it, playing so fast, they won’t tire me out, I could get heaps [of wickets]. I always think about how I can use things to my advantage. Kudos to them but, as a bowler, you’re in the game.” Well, that’s one way to look at it, but there are concerns for India.
That they are facing their biggest ever test in over a decade without their best batsman makes it all the more interesting. Of course, given the calibre of India’s spinners which also includes Kuldeep Yadav, there is still every reason to believe they can extend their unbeaten streak at home. That Australia managed to keep the Bazball in check until Nathan Lyon was around at the Ashes last year would make India all the more hopeful, provided their batting unit steps up without their best Test batsman.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-india-enter-bazball-universe-with-concerns-about-efficacy-of-turning-tracks-9122553/,sports

Jose Mourinho must take over the reins of an international team to relive his glory days,Function over style has been his method and national sides are more open to this philosophy as compared to the great modern clubs,"For much of the last decade, Jose Mourinho has resembled an aged and worn-out one-man band still living on the old hits. His audience just content tuning into his old hits and ignoring the barely chart-topping new hits. The dated Special One track — so ancient that it predated Youtube — the King of Scorn and Sarcasm numbers, or the Master of Jibe and Takedowns number.
There is nothing new or original, or even relevant. Or to put it is straighter, he is out of tune with the melodies of contemporary club football, his methods decadent. He simply does not excite, or intrigue, or even instigate. A few months away from his 61st birthday, the autumn seems to have set in, his fall from the elites of European football, all too evident.

Ranji Trophy: Rookie left-arm spinner S Ajith Ram helps Tamil Nadu script innings win over Railways,"Though he has been part of the Tamil Nadu Premier League set-up for a while, Ajith is still old-fashioned when it comes to speed and line.","It is tough time to be a left-arm spinner in Tamil Nadu right now. At any point in time, there are at least three others vying for a spot with skipper R Sai Kishore being the No 1. When S Ajith Ram made his debut at the SNR College grounds a year back, eyebrows were raised as M Siddarth – another left-arm spinner – was already in the mix. The start wasn’t impressive, but in the three matches he has bowled since then, Ajith has two five-wicket hauls and on Sunday, nearly got another as his 4/40 gave Tamil Nadu an innings-and-129-run win over Railways which keeps them in the race for knockout qualification.
On a day at the SNR College grounds in Coimbatore where 18 wickets fell, Ajith picked six across both innings, playing the ideal second-fiddle to Kishore. But it was yet another innings where he showed why he is bankable in the red-ball format, following up after his impressive outings last season and in the Buchi Babu tournament, where he picked 9/72 against Chhattisgarh.
Though he has been part of the Tamil Nadu Premier League set-up for a while, Ajith is still old-fashioned when it comes to speed and line. Not as tall as his skipper, Ajith’s biggest strength has been his consistency in terms of line and length, with his variations in speed ably supporting it. With a smooth, repeatable action, he mostly operates on a stump-to-stump line, slipping in the odd straighter ones that have been hard to pick. It is a reason why 13 of his 25 wickets have either been bowled or LBW.
On turning tracks like the one that Tamil Nadu played on in Coimbatore, it makes Ajith all the more lethal. “When you can bowl consistently on a particular length, there is no need to do anything different. When you do that, you will be in the game even on unresponsive pitches. When you don’t give anything in the batsman’s arc and if you can build pressure with dot balls, he is bound to commit an error,” Ajith explains his modus operandi.
That Ajith also got opportunities to play a lot of red-ball cricket, especially at the First Division and University level, without much exposure to the white ball in the Tamil Nadu set-up seems to have been a blessing in disguise. “What I’ve noticed is this (consistency) has also helped me to do well in white-ball cricket. It is where I also learnt to vary the pace and not be predictable as well. The key thing is patience. You don’t need to explore a lot for the sake of it. Once you assess the pitch, you will figure out what works,” he says.
In the time he spent waiting for a Tamil Nadu call-up, Ajith attained his MBA degree, which also helped him play a bit of cricket with some familiar faces at the university level. “Obviously, getting a Ranji cap is a dream. But in the time I wasn’t ready for it, I used university cricket to help improve my game. It was the main reason why I enrolled for an MBA degree because it will allow me to play extra games. And from the time I switched to bowling spin, I’ve always been fascinated with this art,” Ajith adds.
With Sai Kishore operating from the other end and tightening the screws, the Railways batting unit had a mighty task, more so after Tamil Nadu made 489 in the first essay, courtesy a double century from N Jagadeesan. With Railways folding for 246 in the first innings, Tamil Nadu enforced the follow-on, from where Sai Kishore and Ajith took over.

First up, Ajith dismissed Mohammad Saif and then removed Railways skipper Upendra Yadav for the second time in the day as Tamil Nadu rounded off a comprehensive win with a day to spare. Next up, they face Chandigarh at the same venue.

What does Priyanshu Rajawat need to become a world beater in badminton,"Rajawat has a beautiful attacking game, with a sensational stick smash and dollops of deceptive tricks, but the best players have the ability to soak up the drudgery of the long rally.","The losses that he collects in 2024 around the world, including at Delhi to HS Prannoy this past week, are going to protect Priyanshu Rajawat from the delusion of inevitable success that accompanies young Indians who are ridiculously talented. While his win against Lakshya Sen is the reassuring stat (and start) in the season that tells him he’s in with a chance to succeed internationally, with that same incredible talent.
Stumbling at times, strutting at others, the youngster who turns 22 in a fortnight, is promising to keep Sen and Kidambi Srikanth on their toes in Olympic qualification season. At World No 30, he needs mammoth points to catch up to Top 16. But he’s one amongst only three shuttlers in the Top 30 to have played 17 or fewer tournaments in the previous year’s time. If his back and ankle hold up and he does end up playing a bulk of the 8 remaining qualification events, he can plot the unlikeliest of surges.

"HS Prannoy struggles to get going physically, bows out in semifinals of India Open",India Number 1 loses to world number 2 Shi Yu Qi 21-15 21-5 .,"One of HS Prannoy’s targets for 2024 was to not just go deeper in tournaments but try and win titles. Frustratingly for him, that would not be at the India Open Super 750 as the country’s top singles shuttler bowed out in the semifinals 15-21, 5-21 on Saturday against world No 2 Shi Yu Qi at the IG Indoor Stadium in New Delhi.
Prannoy came into the match with a 2-5 Head-to-Head record against Shi but had won their last meeting at the Swiss Open. He started the opening game at a superb tempo, to get the crowd fired up early with a 3-0 lead. But neither player was giving the other an each in the early stages, with plenty of winners being hit and unforced errors weren’t winning points.
Prannoy won a breathtaking rally to make it 14-14, which was easily the point of the match. A 37-shot exchange saw the 31-year-old play a signature backhand smash and let out a big roar. At that instant, the match felt like tilting ever so slightly towards Prannoy. What followed that, however, was a service error that left Prannoy frustrated and suddenly the momentum shifted completely towards Shi.

In the second game, Prannoy struggled to get going physically as the mind had some right ideas but the body wasn’t cooperating fully.
After his win on Thursday night, Prannoy had commented that the scheduling wasn’t ideal as a match that gets over at 9.30 pm or so, meant the recovery time would stretch beyond midnight. He’d repeat that on Friday, requesting that at least the final stages of the tournament be played at more reasonable timings. The India No 1, who had attributed his turnaround against Wang Tzu Wei partly to the push he received from the fans, also apologised for the result in the semifinal.
“There are going to be matches like this very often out there where your body might not be 100% and you might have these kinds of days, you just have to forget it as quickly as possible and get back to work the next day,” reflected Prannoy.

Having only just recovered from the flu that saw him lose in the opening round at the Malaysia Open last week, Prannoy said there is still work to be done in building his body up and that it would be important to be balanced in analysing this performance.
A defeat against one of the best players on tour at the moment – Shi had beaten Viktor Axelsen last week in Malaysia – is an opportunity for Prannoy to learn what he needs to do to improve further. “For me, it’s probably better not to analyse too much and go back and see what Yu Qi did well in the game and try to get a few things from his game so that I am better prepared next time,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/hs-prannoy-struggles-to-get-going-physically-bows-out-in-semifinals-of-india-open-9119524/,sports

She, however, started well in third round against the 19-year-old Noskova when she broke in the sixth game and held to love in the next to take charge. After that she barely let the intensity drop after taking the first set as she forced her opponent into uncomfortable positions in the second by working the angles and launching big forehands.
But the Czech held firm, responding with some explosive hitting of her own and breaking en route to levelling up the contest before heaping the pressure on the four-times major champion to take a 2-1 lead in the decider.

Novak Djokovic tells Sania Mirza: ‘Would love to see more Indian kids take up tennis’,Djokovic says he wants to work on the mission of empowering more kids to take up tennis in India.,"Novak Djokovic in a chat with Sania Mirza has said that he wants young kids from India to take up tennis as a profession.
“I wish to be part of some programs designed particularly for the development of kids in their early childhood because that is something, I’m very passionate about,” he said.
“That is also the cornerstone of our foundation. I would like to see more children grabbing a racquet and playing tennis. Being a tennis player, seeing that happen will fill my heart with joy,” he said.
During an earlier interview Djokovic has spoken about his admiration for Indian cricketer Virat Kohli.

“I feel I have a special connection with India. I love the people there; they have been very kind to me and are one of the most genuine and gentle people in the world. They love their sports with cricket being the most followed obviously. But tennis, as I understand, is followed great across the country too.”
He also recalled about an exhibition match that he participated in 2014 in New Delhi along with Roger Federer and several other tennis legends.
“Hopefully, there are many years ahead of me so that I can spend more time in your beautiful country and we can work on the mission of empowering more kids to take up tennis,” he concluded.

What Novak Djokovic can learn from Golden Slam winner Steffi Graf?,"The World No.1 Serb needs to learn from the German legend who regarded crowd validation, adulation and love as a big MEH, while she swept the four Slams and Seoul Olympics gold medal in 1988.","If Novak Djokovic says that he can walk on water, the world is most likely to believe him. So late last year when the Serb said that 2024 for him would be about winning the Olympic gold medal at Paris and sweeping the four Slams, the ambitious new year goal sounded reasonable and realistic for most. The ones not convinced by the Serbian living legend were those who had diligently followed the then 19-year-old Steffi Graf’s magical Golden Grand Slam year of 1988.
Djokovic might have won a world record 24 Slams but at 36 he isn’t the Steffi of the late 80s. The 1988 bar is too high. The German phenomenon lost a grand total of just two sets in all the four Grand Slams she won. Djokovic, by the way, has already lost two sets in the first two rounds of the season’s opening Slam – the ongoing Australian Open.
Steffi’s breakthrough win of 1988 was at Wimbledon, where she stopped Martina’s six-year long unbeaten run. Credited with bringing power to the game, the Czech-born World No.1 was experiencing women’s tennis’s next change of gear. Her serve and volley had given her 8 titles till she met the German wonder girl. But this was 1988, she was getting repeatedly passed by that super sonic forehand and even the flat backhand.
Earlier in the year, Steffi had beaten Evert in straight sets for the Australian Open title. That was the first Slam of the year and the fans, divided by their loyalties to Evert and Martina, hadn’t yet warmed up to the new sheriff in town. Youtube dutifully archives women’s tennis’s big transition. At Melbourne as Evert’s defeat became a formality after Steffi’s 6-1 master class in the first set, there were shrieks of frustration from the stands. “Come on, Chrisie” – is a desperate call from the partisan crowd. It’s a plea to the darling of the crowd to turn the tide and maintain international tennis’s status quo. Evert was helpless. She had the face of a fading star. It is always a tragic moment when a stalwart realises that age has caught up and the game has changed.

Months later at Wimbledon, Martina too seemed to be getting the same feeling. The All-England club was her home. She lifting the silver plate here was as much an annual tradition as was the Duke and Duchess walking on the fabled lawns and thanking ball kids. The crowd was doing its best to cheer the defending champ.
Once when trailing, there was a thunderous applause that instinctively appreciated Steffi’s incredible pass. Martina wasn’t too pleased. “I am a German out here or what?” she muttered to the English crowd. It was loud enough for the broadcast microphone to catch. The commentators talk about it. The complaint is registered by the crowd, they were soon back now on her side.
But Steffi wasn’t bothered. After losing the first set 5–7, she doesn’t get weighed down by the occasion or intimidated by the ominous atmosphere of Martina’s turf. The German teen sweeps the next two sets 6–2, 6–1. No complaints, no excuse, no lament of being unloved. Steffi on the tennis court was the walking billboard of the famous silent German efficiency.

It is this trait that Djokovic lacks. Steffi on court was almost robotic, she rushed around court as if she had a flight to catch. Just watch her between points. Even after hitting a stunning volley at the net, she would rush to the service line with her head down, seemingly oblivious to the cheers around the arena.
Djokovic is different. In a recent interview to Sunday Times the World No.1 was asked: When you set out in professional tennis, did you want to be loved? He takes time to answer. “It gives you energy, a wind in your sails that makes it easier to play,” he would say. In contrast, Steffi was automatically energised. Motorised from within, she didn’t have to depend on winds when at sea.
Also Read | Why Novak Djokovic needs to be loved, doesn’t deserve to be misunderstood
Djokovic has a history of confronting lines-persons, chair umpires and rowdy fans. During the ongoing Australian Open, in the second round against a local player, he stopped play to ask a heckler to come down and speak to him. Steffi would never do that. She was too occupied with tennis. Her rare fan interaction was at Wimbledon. Getting ready to serve, when a voice from the stands broke the silence. “Will you marry me, Steffi?” – a shout hit the air . There were giggles and laughs around. Steffi for once broke her trance and replied – How much money do you have? More laughs.
Steffi would go on to marry Andre Agassi. They would settle in Las Vegas, where Steffi’s extended family too would migrate. They would have a son and daughter but as fate would decide none would be serious about tennis. Steffi would remain a private person, rarely seen at the courts that once echoed to the resounding slaps of her forehands. Thanks to her ultra-expressive and romantic husband Agassi, the world would get to know about tennis’s all-time great a little more.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a BBC interview, Agassi talks about a chalk board at his home where every night he pens his thoughts that express his eternal gratitude to his life partner. At Steffi’s Hall of Fame inclusion evening, he would give a heart-felt emotional speech that would reduce his wife to tears.
“Never needing applause to be at your best, only needing the best that you could give to feel complete. From the roar of voices inside the centre court to the quietness of a child’s bedroom, that generous soul, the unbending strength, that soft spoken integrity has not shaken even once,” he would say. Steffi would throw her blonde hair back to attend to her moist eyes.
Djokovic can borrow Steffi’s aloofness to the applause to pursue his ambitious goal. But even that can’t guarantee a Golden Slam. With the French Open and Paris Olympics on clay, his least favourite surface, and Rafa Nadal eyeing Roland Garros as the arena for his golden farewell, Djokovic’s path is tough. But even without the Golden Slam, Djokovic wouldn’t end up as a lesser legend.
The beauty of sports lies in its ambiguous definition of greatness. Most ‘Greatest’ debates are inconclusive since every generation has one or many of their own. It’s not an exclusive life-long title but a rolling trophy on which the names keep changing. The pantheon of sporting greats doesn’t have a podium, it has pedestals of uniform heights. Djokovic might be the GOAT but Steffi of 1988 was something else.

"Satwik-Chirag to face Malaysians Aaron-Soh for spot in finals tonight, and to reclaim World No 1 spot","After having lost 8 straight matches against the Malaysians, the Indian duo have won the last two, with the help of tactical tweaks from Mathias Boe","The restlessness after losing a medal to Danes Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen at the 2023 World Championship, would have subsided after Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty stubbed them 21-7, 21-10 at India Open. But the Indians are meant for bigger things. A first title in 2024, to start with. And a chance to reclaim top spot in world rankings
The second seeds have another tricky challenge coming up against former world champs Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik, who had been a thorn in their flesh until recently. After having lost 8 straight matches against the Malaysians, the Indian duo have won the last two, with the help of tactical tweaks from Boe. Both those wins came under significant situations, first at the Indonesia Open as Satwik-Chirag clinched their first Super 1000 and then at the Asian Games semifinal. Chia and Soh came through their quarterfinal a thriller of a two-game win against China’s Liu Yu Chen and Ou Xuan Yi.

India Open Super 750: HS Prannoy 2.0 rides wave of crowd support for thrilling win; reaches semifinal against Shi Yu Qi,"Indian eighth seed pulls off a thrilling comeback after looking down and out in the decider to win 21-11, 17-21, 21-18 against Wang Tzu Wei in 77 minutes.","The one consistent feature of HS Prannoy’s recent upturn of form on the international circuit is the number of firsts he has registered late in his career. A historic Thomas Cup gold medal. A first World Championship medal. A first Asian Games medal. A first title for him on the BWF World Tour.
And continuing that trend, he has begun 2024 with his first-ever semifinal appearance at the India Open. It is a tournament with plenty of good memories for him. Playing and defeating his idol Taufik Hidayat, then facing Lee Chong Wei and pushing Viktor Axelsen. But the best result at India’s premier event for him was the quarterfinals against Wang Tzu Wei. On Friday, he pulled off a thrilling comeback after looking down and out in the decider to win 21-11, 17-21, 21-18 in 77 minutes at IG Stadium.
Prannoy 2.0
It is tough to imagine if Prannoy of younger days would have pulled this off after struggling in the second game and going down 5-10 in the third. But this is the new and improved version of Prannoy, one that has made it a point to force himself to be courageous when the chips are down. This is what he had told himself when he slipped and fell in the Thomas Cup semifinal decider against Denmark. Tune everything out. Fight it out.
And so he did. A mini-run of points from that deficit helped Prannoy make it 9-11 at the final change of ends. He let out some of the biggest roars of the night as he caught up with Wang and then finally had a lead at 17-16. Riding the wave, Prannoy safely reached the shore.
Definitively put away! What a match! 🔥

“You need to be fighting with yourself. Stay in the present no matter what the situation is and bravely try different shots, that is one thing I have been trying the last two years,” Prannoy told reporters about his mindset. “You can’t blame yourself when someone like Wang goes on a run with good shots, you can’t get annoyed. You just have to let it go, let him have those points with smashes and net-play. I knew that was going to come, you just have to keep going.”
Indeed, at various points in the match Wang dominated. He had two 6-point runs in the first two games, and a 5-point run in the decider. But when it mattered the most in the end, Prannoy found a way to regroup. And one of those brave points he talked about was a Tai Tzu Ying-esque slice drop to leave Wang on the floor and make it 10-13.

The net-play was a delight to watch from both players on the night and it eventually played a pivotal role. “The net battle was extremely tricky with the new shuttles, as they are fast for the first 2-3 shots,” Prannoy explained. “So we were both trying not to lift early on in a rally because we were both not getting the lengths right. That’s why a lot of the battle was at the net. He’s somebody who can hit very odd shots from the backcourt and comes really hard with the bodyline smashes. It’s tough to defend that and that’s why a lot of net-game was needed towards the end.”
Crowd support
With two winners for the first two points, Prannoy got the crowd warmed up nice and early. The opening game saw the India No 1 play with supreme confidence and the world No 28 from Chinese Taipei looked a bit lost. But an athlete often relies on the energy from fans when the chips are down. After the point at 5-8 in Game 3, Prannoy was floored by a Wang winner. He lay down on the court for a few seconds, face down. The match was slipping away. The crowd was tensed. While he got up, however, the crowd started chanting “HSP, HSP, HSP” for a good minute or so as he regathered himself for the next point.

It can’t be a coincidence that the match turned there. Prannoy hit two straight winners and the crowd responded with bigger cheers. Then came a delightful deceptive push to the backcourt to make it 8-10. After the change of ends, Prannoy upped the ante. A down-the-line smash winner to make it 14-14 was sufficient evidence that the eighth seed was regaining control.
Prannoy said later, “I knew that I had to get the deficit down to 2-3 points in the decider, then the crowd would help me to get through the backend. So when it became 9-11, I was confident that I can win this. Definitely, at 15-all the crowd really helped push through with their energy. Hopefully, we have bigger crowds for the semifinal with full stands.”

Rishabh Pant reminisces on Gabba Test heroics: ‘I didn’t even know how to react when we won the game’,"The wicketkeeper batter who is currently recuperating from a horrific accident suffered in 2022, revealed that it was a dream come true to play a pivotal role in winning the series, especially after not featuring in the first match.","The 2021 Gabba Test between India and Australia has been entrenched into the annals of cricketing history along with the name of Rishabh Pant who played an unbeaten 89 which helped India win the series 2-1. This was the same series where in the first Test India had suffered the ignominy of being 36 all out and then a depleted squad made a remarkable comeback to clinch the series at Gabba.
Two years on from that historic feat, Pant opened up to Star Sports in an exclusive chat about the final Test match in the series.
“That’s just the thing, cricket is not just a game, it’s an emotion. Everyone who was watching the match got so involved, I mean it wasn’t madness; every defense and every shot were cheered for by the team. To play such a match is a different feeling altogether. That everyone has unified and come together to play, especially Ashwin’s performance,” he said.
The wicketkeeper batter who is currently recuperating from a horrific accident suffered in 2022, revealed that it was a dream come true to play a pivotal role in winning the series, especially after not featuring in the first match.
He said, “I didn’t even know how to react when we won the game. I was playing the game with the desire to win, but I didn’t want to get excited too much. It was a fun game to play, but it was very important for me because I didn’t get to play in One Days or T20’s; even Tests didn’t have a spot for me. So I thought to myself that this cannot happen; I have an expectation from myself that you have to be strong. And I didn’t even play the first match, so it was like a dream come true that I had won the game myself; I had won the Series. So I was telling myself that I need to chase this feeling. This is where self-belief comes into play, that when no one is believing in you, you still trust yourself and your abilities,” Pant said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rishabh-pant-reminisces-on-gabba-test-heroics-i-didnt-even-know-how-to-react-when-we-won-the-game-9117961/,sports

Why Xabi Alonso is the perfect manager for Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp?,"In a league with giants like Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, Alonso's Leverkusen currently sits at the top of the points table with a 4-point cushion. With Klopp set to leave Liverpool at the end of this season, the Merseyside club may be seeking a former Champions League winner with the club to take over at Anfield.","“He has the quality that a ‘metronome’ must have. I’m sure that when he hangs up his boots, he’ll be a great coach if he wants to be. He reminds me of Pep Guardiola when I had him as a player.” One of European football’s most decorated managers, Jose Mourinho saw Xabi Alonso’s potential as a manager even while he was a player under him. It’s been fourteen years since Mourinho made that bold prediction. And the Spanish midfielder, who is at the helm of Bayer Leverkusen, is proving the “Special One’s” analysis to be prophetic.
In a league with giants like Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, Alonso’s club currently sits pretty right at the top with a 4-point difference with second-placed Bayern. Leverkusen have played 17 matches this season so far with an unbeaten record – 14 wins and 3 draws.

"Ranji Trophy: N Jagadeesan returns to natural shotmaking game, scores ton to put Tamil Nadu in comfortable position against Railways","To show intent or not has been a question surrounding Jagadeesan throughout his career, but the opener stayed true to his game to score an unbeaten 155, guiding TN to 286/5 at close of play on Day 1.","The last 14 months have been a roller coaster ride for N Jagadeesan. The need to improve his strike-rate had seen him walk out of his shell in T20s, which led to him owning the world record for the highest individual record in List A cricket. In the Ranji Trophy, he scored 534 runs in seven matches, his highest tally so far. But as he stepped out and lofted left-arm spinner Akash Pandey to reach the three-figure mark on Day 1 of Tamil Nadu’s Ranji Trophy third-round fixture against Railways here on Friday, it felt as if he was getting a monkey off his shoulders.
Despite a strong white-ball performance last season, Jagadeesan didn’t even start for TN in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, playing only two games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy that followed, he tallied just 137 runs in 8 matches. And as the Ranji Trophy began, he was handed a demotion in the batting order, with youngsters Vimal Khumar and B Sachin preferred alongside B Sai Sudharsan.

FIH Olympic Qualifiers: How India missed a golden opportunity in shootouts against Germany,India miss five penalties in a row to lose 3-4 in sudden death to Germany; will have to beat Japan on Friday for Paris berth.,"A pall of gloom hung over the Jaipal Singh Stadium. The captain, Savita Punia, was inconsolable. The coach, Janneke Schopman, frowned. The crowd stunned into silence. Shattered that the first chance to qualify for the Paris Olympics had slipped away after coming within touching distance. “We played so hard… But it was not our day,” Savita said, her voice quivering.
It was a sort of heavy-on-the-heart affair that’s become synonymous with the Indian men’s team. The women, too, are following suit.
In a sixty-minute emotional rollercoaster, India gave rise to the expectations of an improbable win by taking the lead against Germany, an opponent they haven’t defeated in close to a decade. Those hopes quickly faded when the Germans clawed their way back by equalising and taking the lead with less than four minutes left to play. Then, when few expected them to, India scored the equaliser so late that the match was forced into tie-breakers.
Their Olympics dreams resurrected, India took that momentum into the shootouts and when they surged to a 3-1 lead, thanks to Savita’s outstanding goalkeeping, they appeared to have had one foot in Paris. Once again, however, Germany found a way back, like they always do. In a high-pressure, winner-takes-all situation, they remained calm. India missed five penalties in a row to lose 3-4 in sudden death after the match ended in a 2-2 draw in normal time.
Savita would rue India’s luck but when they objectively look back, they’d rue their inability to seize the key moments in the fourth quarter that would have sealed the game. For, in shootouts – a thing of skill in hockey compared to a draw of lots that it is in football – Germany would always have an edge mainly because their players also compete in indoor hockey where the size of the field and situations prepare them for these circumstances. It’s not a coincidence that
their men’s team lifted the World Cup last January via sudden death.
India now have less than 20 hours to recover from this heartbreak and prepare for their last chance to qualify for the Olympics. On Friday (push back at 4.30 pm), they will take on Japan who suffered a similar agonising loss to the USA, the second team along with Germany to book the Paris berth from these qualifiers in Ranchi.

The home side will believe that if they can repeat Thursday’s performance, it’ll take something special from Japan – coached by former India goalkeeper Jude Menezes – to stop them. Despite the loss, India showed the spark and spunk that’s been missing from their game, especially against the world’s top-five sides.

This was an engrossing clash of styles. Every time India got the ball, they put their head down and sprinted forward. When Germany had possession, they were hell-bent to keep the ball and pass it calmly, going one way then the other to make steady inroads into the Indian half.
India pressed high, starting with Sangita Kumari harrying the German defenders with her relentless pressing to block the outletting – the first pass from the back to restart the game. The others behind Sangita followed her lead, closing down the passing channels and forcing the Germans to rethink their strategy.
Consequently, they weren’t able to shift the flanks and overload as they would have liked as the players got drawn into making long runs that invariably hit the Indian wall.
Deepika’s goal in the 15th minute rattled them further but as the match progressed, Germany found their rhythm. Charlotte Stapenhorst’s wonder goal – she had her back to the goalkeeper while receiving the pass and was surrounded by two Indian defenders, but performed a stunning 180-degree turn and scooped the ball into the net – had brought Germany into the match just before half-time.
ADVERTISEMENT
Until then, it was India who were dictating the tempo. But in the second half, Germany took control. Coach Valentin Altenburg’s half-time dressing down – he accused his players of getting ‘too excited’ and ditching their style – seemed to have worked as the ball moved from stick to stick more smoothly.
Suddenly, it was India who were chasing the ball and enduring long spells without possession. They did have two golden chances to restore their lead in the final quarter – Deepika was first played one-on-one with the goalkeeper by a piercing Neha Goyal through ball and then Navneet Kaur had a shy at goal but on both occasions, Julia Sonntag stood tall.
Her counterpart Savita was doing the same in the Indian goal; keeping out the German attempts, barking instructions and ensuring the defence remained organised.
Yet, it looked like a matter of time before Germany would score. They had to wait, but Germany got their goal in the 57th minute when Stapenhorst capitalised on a defensive mistake.
ADVERTISEMENT
At that point, it looked like game over for India but Ishika Chaudhary popped in at the right place at the right time inside the ‘D’ to score off a rebound from a penalty corner to make it 2-2 and take the never-ending encounter into shootouts.

Uzbekistan show mirror to Indian football in a 3-0 rout in AFC Asian Cup 2024,India next face Syria with an outside chance of qualifying for the Round of 16. It would require a win and a host of results to go in their favour.,"All it took was three minutes for Uzbekistan to take a pinprick and burst the balloon under which Indian football was operating going into this clash. There was an assumption that the toughest team in their group was well behind them and that it was now time to play football sans fear. Instead, India got an Uzbekistan team that’s easily one of the top 6 teams in Asia, quite markedly better than Australia, and one that scored three goals in the first half itself to quell any hopes that the Southeast Asians had of making this a fight.
And that fight disappeared from India rather quickly – a slow looping ball into the edge of the Indian box was not cleared as it should have, a mere three minutes into the game. And even if it wasn’t cleared, Sandesh Jhingan was caught staring at the path of the ball inside his box while Abbosbek Fayzullaev looped a header over goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu for Uzbekistan’s first goal. Three minutes in and India were already behind.
While it was clear that the Indians were taking their time warming up, it was also quite evident that even the best-suited team was going to be no match for the Uzbeks. It wasn’t that they were an extraordinary team, but rather one that fulfilled their fundamentals soundly. Not once did Uzbekistan have to take their legs out of second gear, such was their dominance against the Indians.

In the 18th minute, they doubled their advantage, once again more in part due to Indian errors rather than Uzbek ingenuity. Defender Rahul Bheke, with no one other than Gurpreet Singh Sandhu behind him and acres of space, decided to try and dribble the ball between two Uzbek forwards. The move was hopeful and hope was extinguished rather abruptly. It was Fayzullaev yet again, who received the ball with space to run into, a task he carried out dutifully. His resultant low cutback didn’t find anyone but left-back Akash Mishra’s clearance hit the post and landed flush in the path of Igor Sergeev, who found himself with no Indian midfielder tracking him back and the easiest of international goals he would ever stumble upon.
After that second goal, India attempted to make some damage limiting moves, like passing within their defence and not letting the ball past the midfield. On the odd occasion that occurred, they were sent scurrying back by wave upon wave of Uzbek players who kept waiting for a reply or two to come their way when none would ever arrive.

And right as the half was about to come to a close, a third goal came. It was a routine Farrukh Sayfiev cross – one that most teams would have cleared with ease. But instead India were caught napping again, this time Nikhil Poojary not marking his man appropriately and paying the price for it as Sherzod Nasrullaev pounced on the ball. His first connection hit the post but then the rebound fell kindly to him and the tap-in was yet another easy international goal handed to the Uzbek left-back.
The second half saw India try to continue doing what they had after the second goal had gone in. More swathes of possession with little to offer going forwards. The introduction of winger Rahul KP would immediately see a shot hit the crossbar for the Indians. Skipper Sunil Chhetri got a couple of golden opportunities but failed to even direct the ball goalwards. Mahesh Naorem had a wonderful strike dart through a maze of Uzbek players before safely being collected by their custodian Utkir Yusupov. But other than those measly opportunities, India watched and succumbed to their second successive defeat of the Asian Cup 2023.

Ranji Trophy: Tamil Nadu’s red-ball aspirations need a shot of inspiration,"After not qualifying for the knockouts, Tamil Nadu doubled down on its commitment to Ranji Trophy and the next two games against Railways and Chandigarh will have a bearing on their season.","Last season’s Ranji Trophy was in the knockout phase when Tamil Nadu set their sights on preparation for the 2023/24. After another disappointing season where they failed to make the knockouts, they had roped in Sulakshan Kularni as head coach to revive their red-ball fortunes. Towards the end of May, even as the rest of the domestic cricketers were either in their off-season or still playing in the IPL, the Tamil Nadu team was having a preparatory camp in Coimbatore.
As they return to the city that sits on the lap of the Western ghats, the next two weeks provide them a chance to show the progress they have made, if any. After a shocking group stage exit in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s, followed by a semi-final finish in the Vijay Hazare, Tamil Nadu’s hopes aren’t high in terms of Ranji Trophy, which they last won in 1987/88 season. Making it past the group stages will definitely be a step in the right direction, but before that they still have a lot to do.

Australian Open 2024: Sumit Nagal loses to Shang Juncheng as history-making campaign ends in round 2,The India No 1 player had made history by defeating Alexander Bublik in the first round: it made him the first Indian since Ramesh Krishnan in 1989 to beat a seeded player in the singles main draw of a Grand Slam.,"Sumit Nagal ran out of steam to lose to China’s Shang Juncheng 6-2, 3-6, 5-7, 4-6 in the second round of the Australian Open on Thursday.
The 26-year-old started brightly, taking the first set with a canter in 40 minutes, before the 18-year-old from China upped the ante and won the war in 2 hours and 50 minutes. The Chinese player will take on Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz in the third round.
The Chinese player, who was handed a wild card into the tournament, raised his level visibly after dropping the first set. After making 17 unforced errors in the first set, he drastically reduced his errors. His service also got better, and he was leading 5-2 with two breaks in the second game.
So clinical was the Chinese after dropping the first set that Nagal saw just one break point in the last three sets.
The India No 1 player had made history by making it to the second round after defeating straight sets to advance into the second round of the Australian Open. Nagal had brought down 27th seed Alexander Bublik 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (5) in the first round of the Australian Open, which had made him the first Indian since Ramesh Krishnan in 1989 to beat a seeded player in the singles main draw of a Grand Slam.
Despite the defeat in round 2, by courtesy of the round 1 victory, the 26-year-old walks away with Aus$180,000 (around Rs 98 lakh) in prize money.

Though the game in Ahmedabad in the 50-over World Cup was a one-sided affair in favor of India, the one played at the T20 World Cup in 2022 at MCG was a Virat Kohli special and arguably one of the best games the arch-rivals have been involved in.

The stadium was unveiled on Wednesday, and its construction is underway and is expected to be finished within three months. “We are excited to be unveiling the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024,” ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said.
“It is an incredibly important milestone in the lead-up to the biggest ICC event ever, with work commencing on the stadium, which will be able to accommodate 34,000 cricket fans,” Geoff Allardice added.

What kind of pitch can we expect?
In the recent meetings between India and Pakistan, the pitches have played a crucial part. The likes of Shaheen Shah Afridi have troubled the Indian batters when there is help on offer, and the Indian batters have attacked him when there is no help and got the team off to quick starts.
In New York, the wicket will be a drop-in one. Usually, drop-in wickets tend to be more in favor of batting.

But the drama and length of the game – a T20 game running almost four and a half hours with two sets of Super Overs – was akin to a match with much more riding on it. There were batsmen taking extra runs despite a throw deflecting of their body, a batsman of Rohit Sharma’s pedigree retiring himself out to get in a faster runner between wickets, and tempers being frayed between India and Afghanistan – two teams that generally get along quite well; the game was one crazy exhibition of the format.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/double-super-overs-seals-a-tense-india-afghanistan-t20-game-9114543/,sports
"India Open Super 750: Satwik-Chirag the solitary Indian winners on second day, Srikanth pays for unforced errors in early exit","The significant disappointment of the day was a first-round exit for Srikanth Kidambi, who looked to be in control of proceedings at one stage, leading 17-14 in the opening game against world No 18 Lee Cheuk Yiu.","The host country’s only winners on the second day of the India Open Super 750 were the in-form Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and even that didn’t come easy. The World No 2, who only reached India late on Monday night after their runner-up finish at the Malaysia Open last week, brushed off some rustiness and lack of practice at the main court of the KD Jadhav Indoor Hall in New Delhi on Wednesday to defeat Chinese Taipei identical twins Fang-Chih Lee and Fang-Jen Lee.
Satwik-Chirag registered a 21-15, 19-21, 21-16 win to reach the second round at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium.

IND vs AFG: Rohit Sharma erases doubts over his T20 World Cup spot with record 5th T20I hundred,"Rohit’s pedigree and hitting ability when set was on full display as he found the boundary, and the stands, almost at will.","India were 22/4 inside four overs but judging by the way Rohit Sharma was going after two successive ducks, there was hardly any circumspection in his approach. The Indian captain could have easily got out for a single-digit score – even a third zero on the trot – but rode his luck and exploded as the innings went on. His fifth T20I hundred, the most by anyone in the format, would have brought much relief for him and the selectors. It would have put to rest any doubts, if there were any in the first place, about his spot for the ICC T20 World Cup.

"At AFC Asian Cup, India’s plan against Uzbekistan: Hold fort, launch sorties","After creditable showing against Australia, coach Stimac's team faces another better ranked team.","After a resolute Indian defensive display was broken down by the Aussies in their opener of the AFC Asian Cup, coach Igor Stimac will need that same tenacity shown in the first half, in addition to a few attacking inputs from his players, as India takes on Uzbekistan in their second Group B encounter. A loss would mean exiting yet another Asian Cup at the group stages, a draw would leave them at the behest of other results and only a win can keep their hopes of moving onto the Round-of-16 alive.
If Australia is a tough team to beat in Asia, Uzbekistan is no different. Ranked 68th in the world, the Uzbeks are age group wizards at the Asian football level, showing their best from the U17-U23 levels and only usually succumb at AFC-level tournaments to the likes of Japan. Their senior national team narrowly lost to Australia in the previous Asian Cup on penalties and many believe that the central Asian giants will occupy one of the eight slots that the continent has for the 2026 World Cup.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/afc-asian-cup-indias-plan-against-uzbekistan-hold-fort-launch-sorties-9114439/,sports
India Open Super 750: Lakshya Sen’s Mission Paris 2024 needs a reboot. The key lies in his mind,Coach Vimal Kumar wants regular sessions with sports psychologist to boost Sen’s confidence and not think about Olympic qualification.,"A year can be a long time in elite sport. In 2022, Lakshya Sen was enjoying a meteoric rise. Commonwealth Games gold medallist. World Team Championships gold at the Thomas Cup. Finalist at the prestigious All England. Title at the India Open. A career-high world ranking of No 6. But in 2023, he struggled. A solitary title at the Canada Open, but not much to write about either side of it.
After he lost in the opening round at the India Open on Tuesday, he cut a dejected figure in front of the reporters. The first question was about his hopes of reaching the Olympics, and the answer was that he was still in the match zone and couldn’t speak about it. But it came across as someone who is searching for clues to a puzzle.

How Israel’s attack on Gaza triggered a crisis in Cricket South Africa,"Jewish cricketer loses u-19 World Cup captaincy over his statement on conflict, protests expected in coming days.","David Teeger is a South African batsman of Jewish origin who was removed as captain of the U-19 World Cup team after an uproar against his statements in support of the Israeli army in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Cricket South Africa had named him captain in September, and retained him after an independent adjudicator, appointed by them, had defended Teeger’s rights to freedom of speech post his offensive speech. Subsequent protests, however, made them make a U-turn, as they stripped him of captaincy though retaining him in the team.
What did David Teeger say that triggered protests?
On October 22, in his acceptance speech at the ABSA Jewish Achiever Awards, the then 18-year old Teeger spoke admiringly of the Israeli army.
“I am now the rising star, but the true rising stars are the young soldiers in Israel… And I’d like to dedicate the award to the state of Israel and to every single soldier fighting so that we can live and thrive in the diaspora,” Teeger said.
It was said in the immediate aftermath of over 4000 Palestinians killed by the Israeli army in retribution for Hamas terrorists who attacked on 7 October, killing 1300 Israelis and taking over 200 hostage. Since then, the number of deaths has gone up in the ongoing conflict with Israel reportedly killing 23,350 civilians in Gaza.
What protests erupted over Teeger’s speech?
During a pro-Palestine protest outside the Newlands stadium where India were playing South Africa in a Test on January 3, according to Cricbuzz’s Telford Vice, the slogans included this: “Teeger, how many doctors did your friends kill today?” The Palestine Solidarity Alliance (PSA) lodged a complaint with South Africa’s Olympic Committee calling Teeger’s views “provocative and an inflammatory political statement”.
According to Cricinfo, statements of grievance were also issued by CSA, Lions, the domestic team that Teeger represents. Others joining were four Johannesburg-based cricket clubs, a civil society group and a director of a company that sponsors Lions.
How is the situation at Gaza viewed in South Africa government official circles?
ADVERTISEMENT
It was South Africa that went to the International Court of Justice alleging Israel was engaged in genocidal acts after its defense forces bombed and invaded Palestine. There is a strong anti-Israel sentiment in South Africa with prevailing belief that Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians since 1948 is apartheid, subjecting them to racial segregation and discrimination. About 50,000 Jews live in South Africa, which is committed to granting religious freedoms to everyone and has seen a bunch of Jews play for South Africa.
Did Teeger say anything after the outrage over his speech?
The publication Businesslive.co.za quotes Teeger as saying his comments were a personal opinion. “Having considered the matter further, I appreciate I may have been naive in thinking that this personal reflection would be received as such. I regret not giving more consideration to whether my impromptu comments would be scrutinised, given my growing prominence in sport, or that these comments may be repeated in the media … It was therefore hurtful to read that my personal reflection on 22 October 2023 of Israel’s response to the Hamas attack has been equated to supporting genocide or condoning hatred based on race, ethnicity or religion.”
He further add: “My personal and honestly held view is that Israel and its soldiers have not committed genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity … On the other hand, I accept that many people and governments, including the South African government, hold an opposing view. Disagreeing in a respectful manner on a contested and emotionally charged matter is a fundamental pillar of our democracy and Constitution. I respect the right of others to disagree with my view on Israel.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Where did he say this? Was it during an official process initiated by Cricket South Africa (CSA). And what did the process result in?
Yes, it was said in his affidavit to the advocate Wim Trengrove appointed by the CSA to conduct an independent adjudication. Trengrove would defend Teeger’s freedom of speech but noted the comments could be viewed as offensive.
The report didn’t say Teeger had “been cleared of all wrongdoing”, as has been reported in some quarters. It did say he had not violated the code of conduct.
Also Read | 100 days and 25,000 deaths later, Israel’s offensive in Gaza shows no signs of slowing
Writing for Cricbuzz after Trengove findings, Telford noted, “If there was a moment for Teeger to rescue the situation by apologising and making clear he knew he represented all South Africans, not only those who agreed with him, and would endeavour to do so better in future, that was it. He hasn’t.” While Teeger has publicly neither expressed regret or apology, CSA went ahead and announced him as captain on December 8, a day after the Trengove report was officially released.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Palestine Solidarity Alliance (PSA), South African grassroots organisation, said Teeger’s comments had caused a “significant rift within the cricket community” and that they continue to question whether he is “fit to represent a diverse South African team and more so, whether he has the necessary capacity to lead any such team”. PSA also called for Teeger’s suspension from the U-19 World Cup squad and said there could be protests at the tournament. CSA did not drop him from the squad after the Trengove findings.
Were the subsequent reactions the reason he was stripped of captaincy of South Africa’s U-19 team for the World Cup?
On 12th January, a day after he turned 19, in a press release, the CSA announced that Teeger was “relieved of the captaincy for the tournament” in the “best interests of all the players, the … team and David himself”. It also added: “We have been advised that protests related to the war in Gaza can be anticipated at the venues for the tournament.”
Has the row impacted Teeger’s cricket?
Teeger’s score sequence in the tri-series ahead of the World Cup was 8 (24), 9 (19), 17 (28) and 13 (12). Later, he would score a resolute 38 in a warm up game against Afghanistan. There were concerns that the excessive scrutiny on Teeger’s Israel stand with unavoidable and incessant media questions, could be another headache for the youngster, as well as open him up to further criticism and attacks with his strident views were he to be captain. It could also distract the team from the World Cup campaign.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-israels-attack-on-gaza-triggered-a-crisis-in-cricket-south-africa-david-teeger-9114332/,sports
Three tactics India needs to beat Germany to seal Paris Olympics spot in women’s hockey,"Play ‘give-and-go hockey’, retain possession, and curb Germany’s flanks-switching style, say former captain Rani Rampal and former coach Sjoerd Marijne","To reach Paris, India will have to do something they haven’t in close to a decade – conquer Germany. The ballsichern-ing (ball-protecting, translated loosely), horizontal-playing, all-controlling, rising-from-the-ashes Germany.
When they last did that in regulation time, back in February 2015, India were nobody in women’s hockey. They barely played big teams, seldom won against them and the Olympics was something they’d only heard and seen but never experienced.

‘A picture I’ll post in my house’: West Indies debutant Shamar Joseph after picking Steve Smith’s wicket on first ball in Test cricket,"Born in Baracara, on the banks of the winding Canje River in Guyana and only accessible through a five-hour boat ride, Shamar hadn't even played a first-class match until February last year. ","Earlier on Wednesday, Shamar Joseph had told his teammates that he was going to pick a wicket off his very first delivery in Test cricket. Bold as the 24-year-old was in his foresight, even he couldn’t have predicted the batsman he’d send back to the pavilion.
Steaming in to bowl from over the wicket, Shamar had already fumbled and abandoned his run up midway through his first attempt. The nerves were jangling, as he’d concede later, “bowling to one of the best batsmen in the Australian team”. And so he went again, this time all the way through and straightening the ball in the corridor of uncertainty to induce an outside edge of Steve Smith that was nabbed at third slip. And off he went, screaming and running about in celebrations, swiftly accompanied by all his teammates at the Adelaide Oval.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/west-indies-debutant-shamar-joseph-steve-smith-wicket-first-ball-test-aus-vs-wi-9114194/,sports

‘Kisiko farak nahi padta’: Mohammed Shami’s blunt take on Hardik Pandya leaving GT for MI,"In his two seasons at the franchise, Hardik Pandya led the Gujarat Titans to the IPL final in both seasons. One of those runs culminated in a title.","Mumbai Indians created ripples in Indian cricket by managing to poach Gujarat Titans’ captain Hardik Pandya back to the franchise where he made a name for himself a few months back.
The move has the potential to change the dynamics of the Indian Premier League (IPL) itself, not to mention the fortunes of both the teams in question. The Titans chose to appoint Shubman Gill as the captain with Pandya leaving. Meanwhile, Mumbai had to make the tough call to hand over the reins of the team to Pandya. It is a move that could likely leave players like longtime captain Rohit Sharma and team veterans Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav unhappy since they have all displayed that they have captaincy potential.
But for Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami, who plies his trade for the Titans, Pandya’s move was just one of those things that happens in sport.
“Kisike jane se kisiko farak nahi padta (It doesn’t matter to anyone if anyone else is leaving the team). You have to look at the team’s balance. When Hardik was there, he captained us well. He took us to the final in both editions and we won once. But Gujarat hadn’t signed Hardik for a lifetime. It’s his decision to stay or leave. Shubman has been made captain now, he will also gain experience. Some day, he might also leave. And it’s a part of the game. Players come and go,” Shami told News24 recently in an interview.
In the two seasons of their existence in the IPL, both played under Pandya’s captaincy, the Gujarat franchise made it to the final of the IPL both years. The won the title in their inaugural season, but lost in the final last time around.
“When you become captain, it’s important to handle the responsibility while taking care of your performances. And that responsibility has been assigned to Shubman this time. He might have some load in his mind, but the players are more or less the same. So he doesn’t need to worry. You need to manage players well and extract the best out of your players,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kisiko-farak-nahi-padta-mohammed-shamis-blunt-take-on-hardik-pandya-leaving-gt-for-mi-9113700/,sports

"Priyanshu steals a march over Lakshya Sen with a fantastic 16-21, 21-16, 21-13 win",Lakshya knows that yet another first-round exit is going to make his quest to reach Paris Olympics all the more difficult.,"It was deja vu for Lakshya Sen at the India Open. And not the good kind. He’d have come in hoping for a repeat of the 2022 season, where he went on to win the title. Instead, it was a reminder of 2023 where he lost in the second round. That day last year, he lost in the second round after taking the lead in the match against Rasmus Gemke of Denmark. In the decider, he started poorly and trailed 1-8, never recovering from that. This year, he lost in the opening round against his good friend Priyanshu Rajawat. Once again in the decider, he trailed 1-9, and that made all the difference in the end.
“The start of the decider could have been much better,” Lakshya said afterward, much as he had done a year back. “Credit to him, but a bunch of unforced errors from me. I think consistently playing my natural game (is where I am struggling at the moment), giving away too many loose points. I do come with a game-plan and to an extent, able to play to that. To do that over three games, I still have to work a lot on being patient and waiting for right chances to attack.”

‘Bowlers have nothing to lose with short boundaries’: Arshdeep Singh ahead of 3rd T20I against Afghanistan in Bangalore,The left-arm quick - a prime contender for the T20 World Cup squad - also teased a new delivery in works to make a stronger case for the big tournament in summer.,"Arshdeep Singh offered a wry smile as he heard a fairly obvious question asked of a bowler before a T20I at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. How did he expect to prevail at a ground with infamously smaller boundaries? His answer offered an insight into the mind of a modern T20 bowler.
“As bowlers, we feel, we have nothing to lose here. The batsmen are always eyeing more and more boundaries, and that’s where we get an opening in the game – you can get more wickets. I guess, when the wicket is flat and the boundaries are short, there are more options of getting the wickets, so you’re always on your toes,” India’s left-arm quick said ahead of the third T20I against Afghanistan in at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Tuesday.

Jose Mourinho sacked by AS Roma in third season at Serie A club; Daniele De Rossi rumoured to be caretaker manager,The 60-year-old Mourinho had said last month that he wanted to extend his contract at Roma.,"José Mourinho has been sacked by AS Roma after just two seasons at the club, the Italian football team announced on Tuesday. The Portuguese manager’s contract was due to expire in June. There are rumours that Daniele De Rossi is being looked at as a caretaker manager for the rest of the season.
“AS Roma can confirm that José Mourinho and his coaching staff will leave the club with immediate effect,” the club said in a statement. “We would like to thank José on behalf of all of us at AS Roma for his passion and efforts since his arrival at the club,” said owners Dan and Ryan Friedkin. “We will always have great memories of his tenure at Roma, but we believe that an immediate change is in the best interests of the club.”

"Sumit Nagal ends 34-year wait: From Rs 80,000 in bank at start of last year to becoming 1st Indian after Ramesh Krishnan to beat seeded player in Grand Slam","Sumit Nagal became the first Indian since Ramesh Krishnan in 1989 to beat a seeded player in the singles main draw of a Grand Slam,","Late last year, India’s top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal lamented being in the position that many on the brutal, unequal professional tennis tour were backed into after a few tough years. Making ends meet, training at the highest level, playing more matches, travelling with coaches, had all been a financial impossibility.
“If I look at my bank balance, I have what I had at the beginning of the year. It is 900 euros (around Rs 80,000),” he told PTI in September. “The funding needed to break into the top 100 is around one crore.”
On Tuesday, after becoming the first Indian since Ramesh Krishnan in 1989 to beat a seeded player in the singles main draw of a Grand Slam, Nagal will get closer to that amount. Even if he loses his next match, after beating 27th seed Alexander Bublik 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (5) in the first round of the 2024 Australian Open, the 26-year-old will walk away with Aus$180,000 (around Rs 98 lakh).

Nagal, a solid baseliner who builds his game around a solid forehand and his athleticism and footspeed, ground his way through a streaky opponent, keeping his cool despite some nervy moments, especially at the finish. Bublik may be a top-30 player, but in a draw where he could have faced Novak Djokovic, he was a favourable lot. The Kazakh may be a flamboyant shotmaker and big server, but his tendency to self-destruct was on full display during the tie against Nagal.

The Indian did well to stay focused through it all winning without dropping a set just as he did in all three rounds of qualifying. He took the lead and stayed ahead in a nervy first set with many trades of serve, and asserted his position in the second, where he began dominating using his forehand and rode all of Bublik’s mistakes, which included 17 unforced errors. After fashioning a lead in the third, Nagal retreated into himself with the finish line in sight, failing to convert while serving for the match, but aided by Bublik’s two double faults in the tiebreaker, got over the line.
Nagal, born to a primary school teacher in Jhajjar, Haryana, did not boast of the kind of financial stability that has been required of Indians attempting to succeed in a sport where there is little institutional support from a national federation or established setup. Those who have had any success before Nagal have done so entirely on their own. Nagal’s modest prize money earnings playing on the Challenger tour – one rung below ATP – and his salary as an Indian Oil employee could only do so much to sustain him, making his most recent result a huge shot in the arm for both his stability and confidence.

This is not uncharted territory for Nagal. He reached the second round of the 2020 US Open when he bowed out to eventual champion Dominic Thiem. One year prior, he had taken a set off Roger Federer in the opening round in New York. But a string of injuries derailed his last few years, and he had to grind his way back to the ranking of World No. 122 after spending considerable time outside of the top 500. He won two titles in four Challenger finals in 2023.
That’s a big win for @nagalsumit 🇮🇳

For Indian tennis as well, this represents a boost during a particularly barren run. 11 Majors and three years have gone by since India had any representation in the singles main draw at all. Since Nagal’s two appearances in the last four years in the second round, the last player to do so was his friend and mentor Somdev Devvarman, in 2013.

The 26-year-old came into the match the hard way, winning three matches in qualifying. There was potentially a route to get in with a wildcard reserved for players from the Asia-Pacific region, as he had done in Australia in 2021, but the All India Tennis Association (AITA) refused to nominate him after his standoff with the federation over his refusal to play India’s Davis Cup World Group 1 playoff tie in Pakistan next month.

Given the year he has had, coming back from injuries and facing uncertainty, this would be the biggest result of Nagal’s career. He has earned himself a winnable second round against Juancheng Shang, ranked 140 in the world, on Thursday following which there is a potential third round against World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz looming.
In 1989, moments after watching Ramesh Krishnan leap into the air with both arms aloft, the then defending champion of Australian Open and world no.1 Mats Wilander would say, “Against some players you could get away with it, but against Ramesh you won’t get away with it playing short.” 34 years later, a Kazakh can say the same line about another Indian. As a boy, Nagal would have his meals – his favourite is Kadhi chawal – on his terrace as he couldn’t be forced away from his favourite pastime of flying kites. As an adult, he is now flying high in Australia. A potential third round against Alcaraz looms; not bad for someone who as a teenager nearly quit the game due to financial setbacks.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/sumit-nagal-alexander-bublik-australian-open-ramesh-krishnan-grand-slam-9111448/,sports
"Born in Pakistan, raised by parents who are mad Shah Rukh Khan fans, Rahman Hekmat is first player of Afghan origin to play for New Zealand","Growing up in a family mad about cricket and Bollywood, the 18-year-old leg spinner wants to represent Black Caps and learn Hindi to enjoy the movies with his parents.","Rahman Hekmat was an infant when his parents moved to New Zealand from Afghanistan in search of a better life. Growing up in Auckland, with parents being ardent cricket and Bollywood buffs, Rahman, the eldest of three siblings, automatically fell in love with cricket, but he still struggles with Hindi cinema.
“My dad really loves Bollywood movies. When he would put up some movie, I would try and jump in and see If I can catch it. If I didn’t get the story, I really got very bored, so he would try to explain it to me. I struggle to understand Hindi. I always tell him to put the caption on, but he says the sense gets lost in the translation,” Rahman tells The Indian Express from Dobsonville in South Africa.
“Recently, my parents went on to watch Shah Rukh Khan starrer Dunki. My father loved the movie, and he explained it to me over the phone for two hours. He is a fan of the actor and was trying to explain everything about him and his work. I try my bit to learn,” he laughs.
Rahman might have a long way to go with Hindi cinema, but in cricket, the 18-year-old has had a rapid rise. He started playing at the age of 11. He wanted to be a fast bowler, and it was in their house’s corridor that his father spotted something in him.
“I started as a pace bowler. One day my dad and I were playing, and I started bowling a few leggies. My dad thought I had a natural action and was quite similar to Shane Warne. He spoke to my coach, not a personal coach, he was just a player’s dad, who used to help out all the kids. The day after, we went for training, and then my coach also saw something in my bowling and said it is something we can work on. From there onwards, it was all leg-spin,” he shares.
Hekmatullah, an engineer by profession, introduced his son to Shane Warne, and then came the fellow Afghan leggie Rashid Khan, who had a big impact on his son Rahman.

“My idols are Shane Warne and Rashid Khan. Warne is the greatest of all time. Rashid Khan is an Afghani and got a quick leg break and wrong’un. The thing is I also love to bowl quite a few googlies like Rashid,” he says. “Over the years, when my cricketing knowledge improved, I started following other wrist-spinners as well. I look up to Ish Sodhi, Adam Zampa, and Adil Rashid. I look up to all the leggies, all of them are different. I try to notice their tactic, their speed, field placements and variations. Each one of them are artists in their own way,” he says.

“I like to hit here and there like Rashid, but I still need to work a lot on my batting. But whenever the ball is in my area, I try to hit it for a six,” he adds.
Rahman, who hails from Kabul, Afghanistan, was born in Peshawar. His father, a cricket nuffy, was ecstatic when Afghanistan were on a roll in the ODI World Cup.
“They went on beating one former World champion to another. It was quite a rollercoaster. My father was over the moon. He supports New Zealand and Afghanistan. Infact, he supports all the teams. He just loves cricket in general, regardless of which team is playing. He just wants to watch the match and be happy about it. Since 2015, the first time Afghanistan played in the World Cup, their progress has been impressive and it has made my dad really happy,” he says.
Rahman Hekmat is the first Afghan origin cricketer to play for New Zealand. (Special arrangement)
Before going to South Africa, New Zealand cricket has arranged a session with senior players like Rachin Ravindra and Ish Sodhi, and Rahman believes the advice from the seniors has eased him and his fellow teammates before the U-19 World Cup.

“We have had a few meetings with Rachin, with him talking to us and answering our queries. We also had a session with the Blackcaps. I was a net bowler. I had a few sessions with Ish Sodhi and Tarun Nethula (former leg spinner) is my coach and mentor since high-school cricket. I talk to him a lot.” says Rahman.
Rahman says playing in the U-19 World Cup would be a great experience for all the players, and they have been told to enjoy the tournament.
“The seniors told us that each one of us in the squad is capable of playing high-level cricket, even for the Blackcaps. We have been told to enjoy the trip and be in the moment. We are trying to enjoy everyday. Have some fun, try and learn from your opposition. You don’t go to South Africa every day to play the U-19 World Cup. We played the West Indies the other day; they were aggressive with their bowling and used a lot of shot balls. They were playing with a lot of intent, which was new for me. I haven’t played a game against an opponent with so much talent,” says Rahman.
Rahman credits his journey to his father, Hekamtullah, and mother, Khatera. The mother son duo work together in a same school.

“My father is an umpire, too, a well-known one in my area. The same is true with my mum; she also loves talking about the game. We love talking about cricket. My younger brother is the only one who doesn’t like it but my 12-year-old sister loves the game. She could understand from my celebration that something good has happened on TV for the team that I was cheering for.”
“My father has given up a lot of sleep to get me where I am. He moved to New Zealand when I was one. He has been to New Zealand a couple of years before to study. What can I say about my mum? A mum is a mum. She is loving and caring. It is hard to explain about their sacrifices. I just want to make them proud, want to become a good role model for my brother and sister.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/born-in-pakistan-parents-mad-shah-rukh-khan-fans-who-is-rahman-hekmat-first-player-of-afghan-origin-new-zealand-cricket-team-9110836/,sports

India vs England: Ben Duckett says he’ll use his ‘reverse sweep’ as forward defence,The England opener says a 50 or 60 on a terrible pitch can be a match-winning one.,"There is still more than a week to go for the first Test match between India and England in Hyderabad but the talks about the “pitches” has become a talking point in the visitors camp.
England opener Ben Duckett on the Sky Sports Cricket Podcast has said his side will not back down against Indian spinners and outlined their approach to negotiate the turn.
“If those pitches are spinning big and I know what my strengths are, I’m certainly not going to die wondering. I think it’s just going to be about finding a method to keep the board ticking over and at times getting down the other end, or picking a bowler you feel like you can score quicker against,” said Duckett.
The England opener also said a 50 or 60 on a terrible pitch can be a match-winning one.
“If we feel like it’s going to be a terrible pitch, sometimes getting 50 off 60 or whatever that may be is going to be a valuable knock for the team and certainly at times we might have to, although they are an incredible seam attack, potentially try and take the seam down before the spin comes on.
“These are just little things that I’m really looking forward to because I know under Baz and Stokesy we will have full license to go and do whatever we want.
“It might be a pitch that doesn’t feel like it’s spinning or nipping and we might just play normally, it might be a green top early on and we can go and express ourselves. The beauty of playing in this team right now is, almost the harder the conditions are it’s going to be enjoyable because we know we can go and play however we want to play and enjoy it.”

Duckett was part of England’s squad for their Test tour of India in 2016. He was dropped from the side after a run of poor scores in the first two Tests, before being recalled in 2022 against Pakistan.
“The more it spins my bat is going to be extremely horizontal,” said Duckett.

“But that’s one thing I’m working on. I think to myself now that I’ve got over ten sweep shots on both sides of the wicket. I did it a bit in Pakistan and it’s not that I’m trying to smack every ball for four. I’ve got different gears to go up in all those different sweep shots and it’s something I’ve been thinking about,” he said.
“If it’s spinning sideways and they’ve got men all round the bat, I might use my reverse sweep as a forward defence, without trying to give too much away. My theory around when I watch people get out when there’s a short leg, man round the corner, silly point and a slip, you kind of get stuck on the crease. I’m jinxing myself now if I get caught at short leg which is definitely going to happen now, but what I’m going to try and do is get rid of those guys around me, and hopefully then life will be a bit easier. If they stay in then fingers crossed you get a few more boundaries and get a little score.”

Duckett made his Test debut in 2016 against Bangladesh. Since then, the 29-year-old is known for playing a variation of sweep shots.
“I’ve played a lot of cricket since then and maturity is a big one for me in those years,” Duckett said.
“The biggest thing this time around is that whatever India throw at me, it’s not going to be a shock. I’ve played on those kinds of pitches. I know full well what to expect when I get out there.”
Talking about India’s spin stalwart Ashwin, he said, “I wasn’t the last left-hander to struggle out there in those conditions against Ashwin. He’s so good everywhere.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I’m sure he’s going to get me out again, he’s a world-class bowler. But I would back myself now on a good pitch or a flatter pitch to not feel like I have to play aggressive shots or sweep every ball.
“If those pitches are spinning, and with the way this team have played over the last 18 months, I know what my strengths are and I’m certainly not going to die wondering.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-ben-duckett-says-hell-use-his-reverse-sweep-as-forward-defence-9111262/,sports
‘Bazball won’t die wondering’: Nasser Hussain warns India against preparing rank turners for Test series,Former England captain says the Indian management should ask for good pitches instead of turners for the five-match Test series.,"Former captain Nasser Hussain has warned India for not preparing rank turners for the five-match Test series against England, starting from January 25 in Hyderabad.
“If I am in the Indian management, I would ask for good pitches, that spin a bit. Because then their spinners and batters will out bat and out spin ours,” Nasser Hussain told Michael Atherton on the Sky Sports Cricket podcast.
“If they ask for pitches that spin a lot then it becomes a bit of a lottery and brings England’s spinners into the game. The way Bazball goes about its business, the way England’s batting goes, they won’t die wondering.”
England last won a Test series in India in 2012-13 under the captaincy of Alastair Cook where spin twins Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar starred in the momentous 2-1 triumph. Hussain also said that Indian fans are waiting to see how their side can put England’s Bazball strategy to bed.
“There’s been a lot of talk about Indian cricket and there’s been a lot of talk about Bazball,” said Hussain.
“My sense in the World Cup was that a lot of Indian fans are waiting to see how to put Bazball to bed,” he added.

Hussain also recollected how the pitches started turning from ball one after England won the Chennai Test in 2021.

“I think that if England go ahead as they did last time, then I expect both Rohit and Rahul will just have a little bit of tap on grounds men hat, saying we want more spin,” he said.
Hussain also shared few suggestion for the England batters on how to negotiate the spin trio of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.
“If Ashwin is bowling and it is spinning out of the rough, the big booming drive is still a high risk shot. Jadeja angling in and clipping leg, using your bat and pad together against Axar Patel. These are just no go areas, whatever the mindset your batting line-up has,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/bazball-wont-die-wondering-nasser-hussain-warns-india-against-preparing-rank-turners-for-test-series-9111130/,sports

Nine wickets for 48 runs: Gujarat bundle Karnataka for 103 to claim six-run win in a Ranji Trophy nail-biter,"In what was the first thriller of the Indian domestic red ball season, Gujarat folded Karnataka for 103 runs - when they needed 110 to win - on the last day of the Pool C match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad to claim a famous win.","Prasidh Krishna pursed his lips. Without even having to look back at the stumps, the Karnataka number 11 knew he’d been cleaned up. The Gujarat players on the field couldn’t resist the wild celebrations that followed as the visiting skipper Mayank Agarwal stood by the boundary with a wry smile on his face. He’d scored a century in the first innings and stitched together a partnership that took his team halfway through the line in the second, only for tide to turn in the home side’s favor, and how?

‘Bindaas khel’: Yashasvi Jaiswal reveals Rohit Sharma’s advice before taking strike in Indore T20I,Jaiswal says he still has a long way to go and he wants to continuing working hard.,"On the eve of the first T20I in Mohali, head coach Rahul Dravid has made it sure that Yashasvi Jaiswal is the first choice opener with captain Rohit Sharma. Unfortunately, the southpaw missed the opening match due to groin injury, but in Indore, he proved the words of his coach right and it was his strokeful 68 off 34 balls at the top of the order and Shivam Dube’s 63 not out off 32 balls helped India register a six-wicket series-clinching win as the hosts easily chased down the target of 173 with 26 balls to spare.
“Kaafi maza aaya batting karne mey, Wicket bhi kaafi acha tha (I enjoyed my batting, wicket was also very good). We had really good target to chase, in my mind I wanted to give a good start,” Jaiswal told the BCCI.tv.

India vs Afghanistan: Virat Kohli’s cameo in Indore signals an intent to not play the waiting game,"On Sunday, in his first T20I since the 10-wicket semifinal loss to England at the 2022 World Cup in Adelaide, Virat Kohli seems determined to prove there are more strings to his bow.","The scorecard will show 29 off 16 balls, hardly much for a player of Virat Kohli’s pedigree, but how he batted and got out seemed to suggest he was willing to go against his nature to fit into the new brand of T20 batting that India is trying to embrace.
Kohli, even in the shortest international format, is known more as an accumulator at the start of his innings, before he showcases his rich repertoire of strokes and going into overdrive as the innings reaches its climax. When he first comes in, the most characteristic feature of his batting is his speed between the wickets that keeps the scoreboard moving and gets him into the rhythm of the game.

"IND vs AFG: Jaiswal, Dube win the day’s battle of strike-rates, even as Sharma, Kohli try to hop onto blaster’s bandwagon",Afghanistan swatted aside by India as Yashasvi (68 off 34) and Shivam (63 off 32) help chase down 173 with 26 balls to spare.,"If the tickets of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to the T20 World Cup are indeed confirmed, a couple of ducks are unlikely to matter much to the selectors. And it seems to be a package deal, regardless of their respective performances or scores. It forces the younger batsmen, who have done little wrong in terms of output as well as intent in the opportunities they have got, to audition against each other.
Both veterans seem to have read the room about the strike rate, judging by the ugly hoick that Rohit attempted to be bowled first ball, after the run-out in Mohali, and the uncharacteristically ultra-aggressive approach from Kohli from the outset. Needing 173 to seal the series against outclassed Afghanistan, Kohli and Yashasvi Jaiswal provided the impetus that took away all the pressure from the chase, which was completed with as many as 26 balls to spare for a six-wicket win.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-afg-jaiswal-dube-rohit-virat-indore-9109421/,sports

"Hockey Olympic Qualifiers: Salima Tete delivers left, right and centre as India step up in must-win match vs New Zealand","New Zealand equalise after early goal, but India bounce back immediately in the opening fifteen minutes to lead 3-1 and hold on to that for the rest of the night.","Just after 30 seconds from pushback, Udita hit a long pass to Neha at the edge of the circle. The midfielder earned a foul, released a pass to find Salima Tete down the right flank. The speedster from Simdega, who was dubbed as ‘Ferrari’ by former coach Sjoerd Marijne, broke through at pace and dribbled into the circle. Her pass then found the stick of Jyoti first and broke kindly for another Simdega star in Sangita Kumari who swept home first time to put India ahead.
That goal came with 14:29 on the clock, and 41 seconds into a massive clash against New Zealand at the FIH Olympic Qualifiers in Ranchi on Sunday, India took the lead. Make no mistake, the pressure on Savita Punia’s team for this clash was incredibly high after a defeat to USA on Saturday. Another defeat here and that was it for their dreams of reaching Paris.

Liberos might not exist but Beckenbauer’s soul is still integral part of modern football,"Like the late German legend several full-backs continue to counterattack with a quick offensive transition, none as efficiently as Manchester City’s John Stones.","It was a slap that changed the course of German football. Growing up in Giesing, a war-ravaged working-class suburb of Munich, now in the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium, young Franz Beckenbauer was a pacy centre forward who wanted to play for 1860 Munich, the strongest German club in the 1950s. But as destiny charted, during an U-14 game for local team SC 1906, he was fiercely marked and supposedly slapped by Gerhard König, the 1860 youth team defender. In anger, he refused to join 1860 and signed for then minnows, Bayern Munich.
At Munich, a sharp youth coach realised that he was so skillful and quick, he was prone to rugged tackles and injuries. So he decided to hide him in the midfield, probably knowing that the kid was so intelligent and technically sound that his attacking prowess would not be stifled wherever he played. He would spend his early days as the base of midfield, more like a deep-lying playmaker as well as a defensive cover, before he was shifted to the heart of the defence. But his instincts meant he would carry the ball upfield and score goals (he scored seven in his first 13 appearances for his country).",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/liberos-franz-beckenbauer-soul-part-modern-football-john-stones-9109370/,sports
"IND vs AFG: On record 150th T20I, Rohit Sharma becomes joint-second with most golden ducks","Having been removed on his first ball on Sunday, Rohit had also been run out without scoring in Mohali in the first T20I - a mix up in the middle that left him fuming over Shubman Gill. ","On a night that saw Rohit Sharma become the first to play 150 T20Is, the Indian captain jumped higher in an infamous tally when he advanced down the wicket to play Fazalhaq Farooqi but missed out on the ball and got his stumps rattled.
It was a 12th golden duck dismissal for Rohit – joint second-most by any batter in the format. The Indian captain is now level with Ireland’s Kevin O’Brien whereas another Irish batter – Paul Sterling – leads the tally with 13. Not having played T20Is since the World Cup semifinal defeat to England in November 2022, Rohit has returned to play the format with less than six months left in the World Cup this summer.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-afg-rohit-sharma-most-golden-ducks-150-t20i-9109327/,sports
IND vs AFG: Shubman Gill dropped as Yashasvi Jaiswal returns to open alongside Rohit Sharma,"Among other changes for the Indian team that started in Indore was the inclusion of Virat Kohli, who marked a comeback to India's T20 colors for the first time since the 2022 T20 World Cup exit.","Following a measly outing off 23 off 12 deliveries in the first of three T20Is, Shubman Gill was dropped from India’s playing XI for the second T20I against Afghanistan in Indore on Sunday. Swapping in place of the 24-year-old was left-handed Yashasvi Jaiswal.

"In aftermath of the Cape Town rapid-fire Test, former Australia captain Ian Chappell bats for trimming down format to four days","Chappell, who played 75 Tests for Australia from 1964 to 1980, also spoke in favor of trimming the Tests from five to four days, a necessary move born out of ""a lack of competitiveness"" among a lot of Test playing teams.","Former Australia captain Ian Chappell, who played as many as 75 Tests, is batting in favor of trimming the longest format of the game from five to four days, a necessary move born out of “a lack of competitiveness” among a lot of Test playing teams.
“Discussion is gaining momentum for four-day Tests in the wake of five-day games lasting slightly longer than a 50-over match. There are valid arguments about the increasing costs and for the introduction of four-day Tests, but why isn’t the tardy pace of play being addressed?” Chappell scathed in his recent column for ESPN Cricinfo.
Even though the former cricketer and broadcaster was all praise for the aggressive tactics deployed by Ben Stokes and England to make the game more entertaining, Chappell conceded that the problem at hand was the waste of time in between the game.
“Why are batters allowed to meet mid-pitch during overs to discuss who knows what without penalty? Why aren’t batters informed that etiquette requires them to be in their stance at the crease when a bowler is ready to deliver? Heat extremes excepted, why allow drinks at times outside of the regular break? Why do glove changes occur so often? Surely this is superstition more than need,” Chappell noted.
The 80-year-old’s comments come in the aftermath of the India-South Africa Cape Town Test, which saw 23 wickets fall on day one, swiftly followed by a wrap up in the fifth session of the match.
As the ongoing World Test Championship cycle takes full swing in 2024 with the likes of India and England playing more than a dozen of red-ball matches throughout the year, including a five-match series commencing later this month, the existential questions are bound to be asked of the longest format of the game in the year of another T20 World Cup.
Why no recriminations against those charging at umpires?
Chappell also lambasted world cricket administrators and the game’s laws for the inaction against players who ‘charge’ towards the on-field umpires in their attempt to get a call in their favor. Pinpointing on a recent incident, the former Australian skipper wasn’t reticent of taking shots at Pat Cummins and Co.

“How come players are allowed to charge at umpires while they are appealing, without any recrimination? I was appalled to see Australian players indulging in this heinous behaviour in the SCG Test recently. This bad habit should be subject to penalty,” Chappell conceded.

‘Bazball deserves to be seen by entire nation’: MP urges the upcoming IND vs ENG series to be televised for free in the UK,With less than three weeks left for the series no official broadcaster has been named for the fans to watch the marquee series,"The upcoming England tour of India is one of the most anticipated series in cricketing circles. With India being a dominant side at home and England under Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes playing the “Bazzball” brand of cricket, the series promises to be a cracker.
However, with less than two weeks for the series, there has been no clarity in England on which channel the marquee series would be televised. “As it stands, the contest is yet to find a home on British television,” quoted the Telegraph.

It was the hustlers with wicked serving skills, speed and shot variations who masterfully altered every moment and mood each second of rallies and aced unbalanced reflex returns, that the Chinese coaches went sniffing after.

It was not just the revelations – the emotional toil of playing against crowds that have mostly rooted against him, the way he uses eye contact during changeovers and notices minute details about his opponents to wear them down, the work that goes behind building his famed mental resilience, among others – but the comfort with which he offers up these details himself.

The reason is that the Indian team will once again prepare a turner for the visiting England team for their five-match Test series at home. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) senior selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, picked the Indian team test squad for the first two Test matches and have chosen two full-time wicket-keepers, Bharat and Dhruv Jurel.
The Indian Express understands that the team management has made it clear to the selection committee that Rahul was asked to keep wickets in South Africa due to the bounce in the pitch. The fast bowlers came into play during the two Test match series against South Africa, and most of the time, the ball was collected over waist height. As a result, the Indian team has informed the BCCI and selection committee that Rahul won’t keep wickets.
“The Indian team will once again be playing on a turner track, and the team management felt that specialist spinners should handle the job at home. The team has many quality spinners, and the team won’t take any chances, especially when the pitch being offered will be a turner,” a source in the BCCI informed.
The national selection committee has picked four spinners – R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav – and they will be seen in action.
Fast bowlers to be rotated
The Indian team management has decided to rotate its fast bowlers during the five-match Test series. The team management has already decided that no fast bowlers will be playing all five Test matches, and instead, they will be given rest as per workload management. The first two Test matches will see Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Mukesh Kumar, and Avesh Khan. There is no clarity at the moment on whether Mohd Shami will be playing Test matches ahead, as the pacer hasn’t resumed bowling yet.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ks-bharat-not-kl-rahul-to-keep-wickets-during-india-england-home-test-series-9108240/,sports

AFC Asian Cup: India’s strong defensive show no match for Australia,"The 2-0 win puts Australia in the driver’s seat in Group B, which also has Syria and Uzbekistan. India, on the other hand, will have to surpass all expectations to make it to the knockout stages.","Sunil Chhetri resolutely guarded the near post. His strike partner Manvir Singh was flying in to intercept a dangerous cross and head it away from the India goal. Sandesh Jhingan had a bandage wrapped on his forehead and took more blows on the body than Pujara did in that Gabba Test.
For 45 minutes, India’s players formed a blue-coloured wall in front of their goal and blocked everything that Australia threw at them. The Socceroos had 14 attempts on goal; the Blue Tigers only three; Australia enjoyed 72 per cent possession and earned 12 corners. But for all their slick passes, sneaky runs, delightful crosses and through balls, Australia couldn’t get past India’s last-ditch defending.

‘I don’t like waiting to bat’: The main reason behind Steve Smith’s promotion as an opener,"Steve Smith will open for Australia in the Test series after David Warner's retirement , says he likes facing the new ball.","Steve Smith, who has been elevated as Test opener by the Australian selectors says it will give him more chance to spend at the crease. Smith, who bats at No 4 will take David Warner’s place, who retired after the Pakistan series.
Cameron Green, who lost his No 6 spot to Mitchell Marsh during the Ashes will take Smith’s position at No 4.
“I mean, there’s been conversations happening for a little while,” Smith said on Fox Cricket.
“Obviously, knowing that Davey was gonna finish up in Sydney and I know they were keen to get Cameron Green back into the fold as well.

“For me, it was a conversation saying, ‘I’m keen to go up to the top. If you were thinking about Greeny up the top, he hasn’t done it at all’. (Green) bats four in Shield cricket.”
Smith, who also boasts extraordinary form when exposed early in the innings and prior to moving to no.4, averaged 67.07 batting at first drop.
“Since Marnus has been back playing at no.3, I’ve been waiting to bat for quite a long period of time,” Smith continued.

“I don’t like waiting to bat, so I thought why don’t I put my hand up and have a crack up top? That way, you can get Cameron Green in and you’re playing your best six batters.
“I am (excited). I like facing the newer ball. If you look back to the 2019 Ashes, I was in pretty early there most of the time where I was facing the new ball.
“I batted no.3 from a number of years as well and was in early and did pretty well against the new ball.

"Handling of Ishan Kishan situation, persisting with Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli shows up Indian cricket as crusty, conservative and outdated",Ishan Kishan asking for a break because of mental fatigue should never have been pushed into a corner by the team's decision makers.,"After warming the bench for most of last year, Ishan Kishan asked for a break in December, during the South Africa tour. He is said to have told the team management that he was mentally fatigued and missing home. In the days to follow, he would be seen on Kaun Banega Crorepati talking about his tattoo, cracking jokes and regaling the crowd with Team India stories. Later, pictures of him in Dubai would emerge. These were usual frames that the young put out to tell the world that they were having a good time. One had him on the balcony of a skyscraper with a bay full of yachts below, another had him at a fine dining restaurant. So far so good.
But this didn’t go down well with the righteous decision-makers of Indian cricket. The 25-year-old wicketkeeper from Jharkhand, scorer of two half-centuries in three T20Is against Australia at No.3, a certified white-ball dasher with an ODI double hundred to his name as an opener, was mysteriously dropped for the Afghanistan series. He was not even picked for the Tests. Dhruv Jurel too was higher in the pecking order now. Also missing from the T20 squad was Shreyas Iyer, the find for India in the ODI World Cup.
Taking Ishan’s place in the T20I squad were a couple of lower-order wicketkeepers – Sanju Samson and Jitesh Sharma. They were the designated finishers, the high-pressure operators, chasers of impossible targets. Meanwhile, the position in the team where Ishan bats in white-ball cricket was now to be occupied by the old owners. Back in the team were two stalwarts in their mid-30s – Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.
The selectors were making a statement – the veterans of many failed ICC events were once again the designated Top 3 batsmen for the T20 World Cup in June. Was it the right move? Not really.
Both Virat and Rohit are known to be the anchors – an ODI cricket concept that is on the verge of extinction in T20s. In this day and age, having even one ODI native in a T20 playing XI is considered a luxury. India, oblivious of the changing dynamics of T20 cricket, was indulging two of them. Both might have enjoyed spectacular individual success at these world events but India under their watch haven’t won an ICC trophy for more than a decade. Even in IPL, they don’t have the numbers that give them the aura of match-winner batsmen. They are brands, they are seen as leaders, but not your every-day game-changers.
Also Read | India vs Afghanistan: Was it mistrust that resulted in the dropping of Ishan Kishan?
Were the selectors being conservative or were they reluctant to take the tough unpopular calls that could potentially trigger waves of social media attacks by troll armies of the dropped megastars? Since the good old tradition of national selectors facing the media after every meeting has for long been dumped, the rationale behind these decisions would forever remain a state secret.

— Ishan Kishan (@ishankishan51) January 12, 2024
Days later, head coach Rahul Dravid, before the first game of the Afghanistan series, would further complicate the Ishan matter. “Ishan Kishan was not available for selection. He requested for a break in South Africa which we agreed to. He has not made himself available for selection and when he does, I am sure he’ll play domestic cricket and make himself available for selection,” he said.
Unequal treatment
Those tuned in to Indian cricket long enough know what “he’ll play domestic cricket and make himself available” means. It’s a euphemism for a rap on the knuckle. It’s the classic class teacher’s ‘go stand in the corner’ snub. Worryingly, it can also be the proverbial push over the cliff into the abyss that has thousands of hopefuls trying to crawl up.
ADVERTISEMENT
There was a counter-question that Dravid needed to be asked. With the five-Test series against England round the corner, a vital outing keeping in mind the World Test Championship calculations, aren’t Sharma and Kohli better off playing a Ranji game than a T20 series against Afghanistan?
One of the decision-makers, when asked about the Ishan situation, fished out that good old cliche. “Ishan remains in the scheme of things,” he would say.
It’s that stale carrot that gets historically dangled in front of all horses – those genuinely in race and also the ones practically out of it.

But what exactly is this “scheme”? It’s the same that the selectors have stuck with for years now. By including Rohit and Virat for the Afghanistan series, the selectors were making it clear that transition will have to wait. As has been India’s good old tradition of giving an unendingly long rope to seniors, the bold decision seems to have been pushed back. In Indian cricket, the barn door gets slammed only after the horses have bolted.
ADVERTISEMENT
Only once, before the 2007 World T20, India took the courageous call of trusting a bunch of promising youngsters and a fresh leadership approach. But MS Dhoni’s historic win, with a team without Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Dravid, is considered an exception, a miracle that just happened. The success of that leap of faith didn’t inspire subsequent selection committees. They continued to take those mini hop-scotch jumps without going anywhere.
To be a true world leader, India’s decision-makers need to keep pace with the ever-evolving cricket, and more importantly the cricketers. Those in the know say that the Indian team management was insensitive to the frustration that Ishan faced while being benched for a long time. Mental fatigue is a Western concept, and we, the relentless toilers, never face such frivolous trauma – was the thought process.
Ishan was also blamed for not taking his non-selection in the right spirit. The leadership wants the Ishans of the world to be grinning widely, running enthusiastically with drinks while waiting on the fringes. Even when the seniors get undeserving extensions, the juniors shouldn’t sulk but do joyous cartwheels for the sake of the team. They shouldn’t even take a break from the game and post happy pictures from Dubai. That’s not what good juniors do, feel India’s decision-makers. Ok boomer.

Malaysia Open Super 1000: All-out offence against Chinese pair takes Satwik-Chirag into first semifinal of the year,Indian pair demolishes He Ji Ting-Ren Xiang Yu in two quick games and face Korean world champions for a spot in the final.,"It’s the sort of scorching form Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty were in at the Korea Open last year.

"AFC Asian Cup: Ravaged by injuries, India face World No 25 Australia first up","With just 12 days of preparation and missing key players, Blue Tigers face their biggest test in 12 months.","Facing an Australian team ranked 25th in the world – one that gave Leo Messi hell at the 2022 World Cup and troubled England with their physically monstrous set piece routines – is a daunting task in itself for India. And if that isn’t enough, the Blue Tigers are without four press-resistant players that constituted a well-built spine of the team for the first time in decades. What could have been a showcase of how far Indian football has come in the last one year is now set to be reduced to an act of mere survival at Ahmed bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan on Saturday as both teams begin their Asian Cup 2023 campaign.
It is remarkable how things have gone against India in the build-up to this tournament. Coach Igor Stimac pleaded for more time with the team but instead got a grand total of 12 days. If India was Japan, 12 days would be no issue but the time it takes Stimac to scrub the poor domestic structure out of his players is where the issue lies.

"Tests vs England: Ishan Kishan overlooked, Dhruv Jurel called up as India announce four-prong spin attack","Rahul tipped to keep wickets, while Gill will need to prove himself in first two Tests to keep his spot.","The message is loud and clear for Ishan Kishan. The wicketkeeper, who sought a rest and missed Tests against South Africa, will have to play domestic cricket and earn his comeback. The senior selection committee has overlooked him for the first two Tests against England and have given a maiden call-up to Uttar Pradesh’s Dhruv Jurel as four spinners headlined the 16-member squad.

With regards to Prasidh Krishna, who made his debut in South Africa, it is learnt that the pacer has picked up a quadriceps injury on Day 1 of Karnataka’s Ranji fixture against Gujarat in Ahmedabad.

ICC has rated the pitch provided as “unsatisfactory.” However, former West Indian cricketer Clive Lloyd said, “If you are playing top-class cricket, you should be able to handle those sort of things,” during an interaction with the media after receiving the Lifetime Achievement award from Adamas University of Kolkata in Kolkata.

‘Speed gun won’t go above this’: Shaheen Shah Afridi offers strange theory after criticism for bowling at 130 KPH speeds in PAK vs AUS Test series,Afridi picked up eight wickets at an average of 41.62 in the series. He looked in a better rhythm for the second Test in Melbourne than in the first one in Perth.,"Fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi led Pakistan’s attack in the side’s recently concluded three-match Test series against Australia. However, the bowler had a mixed series and missed the final Test. There was criticism against the seamer from former Pakistani bowlers at the pace that he was bowling.
“If you’re (Shaheen) just going to carry on like that, then you are going to become a medium pacer. What I’m seeing right now, yeah there’s a little bit of swing there, but his pace is way down,” former fast bowler Waqar Younis told ESPNCricinfo during the series.

‘I am not thinking of economy rate anymore’: Axar Patel after helping India defeat Afghanistan in 1st T20I,Left-arm spinner Axar Patel says that since he is not a leg-spinner and he can't bowl googlies but has added 10 per cent more to his bowling skills during rehabilitation phase after injury.,"Axar Patel suffered a quadriceps injury during the Asia Cup and missed the World Cup, but he says he has worked on his bowling during rehabilitation at the NCA and has added “5 to 10 per cent”.
“It was an unfortunate injury, but it was not the first time I was injured. My mindset during the rehab is how I can improve my game. In the NCA, I worked a lot on my bowling. I have worked consciously to add 5 to 10 per cent in my bowling,” Axar Patel told the reporters after the match. “Against Australia, I have started varying my pace and started using the crease. As a left-arm spinner, you don’t have much variation, I can’t bowl googlies like a leg-spinner,” he said.

Rhythm’s third place finish secured a quota place for the Paris Olympics, the country’s record 16th. The previous biggest contingent from India was 15 at the Tokyo Olympics.

"India vs Afghanistan T20I series: Dube excels with bat and ball, T20 regulars play their roles as hosts record facile win",Left-hander makes full use of opportunity to hit unbeaten 60 off 40 balls as India beat Afghanistan by six wickets in T20 series opener,"On Wednesday evening, Shivam Dube didn’t even pad up at the nets. He spent his two hours bowling in small spells to different batsmen, before taking a few throwdowns from Raghu. It was a clear sign that the Mumbai man was not in contention to play in the first of three T20 Internationals, but an injury to his Yashasvi Jaiswal gave him an opportunity, and the all-rounder grabbed it with both hands.
With his military medium pace, Dube kept the run flow in check and even got the wicket of Afghanistan captain Ibrahim Zadran. He walked out to bat when India had lost both their openers, and the visitors were sensing a route back into the contest. Dube first steadied the ship with Tilak Varma who scored a sedate 26, played the perfect foil to Jitesh Sharma, saw Rinku Singh do his thing from the other end, and reached his second T20I fifty in 38 balls as India coasted to the target of 159 with two and a half overs to spare for a six-wicket win.

Ranji Trophy: Former Amazon executive Koushik Vasuki making up for lost time with Karnataka,"An integral part of Karnataka's pace pack, Koushik gears up for Gujarat challenge in the second round of Ranji fixtures.","Koushik Vasuki remembers the time — nearly a decade ago — when he took up late night shifts at Amazon just so he could play cricket in the morning. In his early 20s and yet to graduate to zonal cricket, he didn’t have much choice. Cricket — his boyhood love since the time he played with a plastic bat and ball with his father in the Yelahanka railway quarters — was still plan A. But that in itself wasn’t enough.
“Coming from a middle class family, you need to have a backup,” he tells The Indian Express as his prime reason behind taking a longer route to make a profession out of his passion. Hence, the mechanical engineering course from Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering in Bengaluru, a year working in the corporate world, and eight years and counting as an employee at Central Tax and Customs. “It was never one thing at a time. During engineering, I did not play a lot of club matches because it was clashing with my exams, which is why they never picked me for zonals. When I had Karnataka Premier League games, I used to take up night shifts. Corporate jobs don’t give you additional leaves for playing. It took a toll on my body,” he says.

Malaysia Open badminton: How Ashwini Ponnappa-Tanisha Crasto pulled off a huge win against former world champions,Ashwini Ponnappa's experience and Tanisha Crasto's aggressive instincts dovetailed perfectly as the Indians registered a significant upset over Japanese stars at #MalaysiaOpenSuper1000.,"An arching parabola of a floated return from Ashwini Ponnappa, timed from her backcourt to drop slowly and lull the opponents. Followed immediately by a scything smash, hit brutally flat and fast and rushing on them by Tanisha Crasto, looming like a storm from the front court.
The Indian pairing used their in-rally changes in pace and waves upon waves of this 1-2 routine marvelously to scramble the minds of former World No 1s and twice World champions, Mayu Matsumoto and Wakana Nagahara, winning 21-19, 13-21, 21-15 at Malaysia Open Super 1000 on Wednesday.

"Hockey: Baljeet Kaur’s speedy rise from Tarn Taran to India’s squad for Olympic qualifiers, with help from a former World Cupper","Baljeet Kaur, a late addition to India's squad for Hockey Olympic qualifiers, was among a group of underprivileged girls spotted and mentored by Daljit Singh Dhillon.","It was a call of duty that saw Daljit Singh Dhillon relocate to Tarn Taran, the drug-infested district near Amritsar. And chance, that the then Deputy Superintendent of Punjab Police and former India forward stumbled upon a group of girls playing hockey at a government school ground.
“I saw them while I was out jogging in the morning. There were around 20-25 girls. They didn’t have basic gear and the condition of the ground wasn’t great either. I saw them a few times and then couldn’t resist myself from asking them if they wanted ‘India’ training,” Dhillon says, referring to the methods he’d experienced with the national team. For the girls, most of them in their pre-teens, it was a no-brainer. “They agreed,” Dhillon adds.

"Aman Sehrawat begins new year with title, braces for showdown with Ravi Dahiya in race to Paris",The 20-year-old wrestler overcomes early jitters to clinch gold in 57kg category at UWW Ranking Series.,"For months on, Indian wrestling’s biggest prodigy, Aman Sehrawat, had to suffer a snippy taunt at his akhara – dheela.
It had nothing to do with his relaxed demeanour. Rather, that was how Sehrawat’s coaches described – at times sarcastically, sometimes in a caustic way but always out of frustration – his wrestling style in the opening few exchanges of a bout. The barb would have perhaps rung in his ears on Wednesday.
While he went on to win the 57kg title at the UWW Ranking Series in Zagreb, beating China’s Wanhao Zou 10-0 in the gold medal bout, Sehrawat was a little slow off the blocks earlier in the day in the opening round.
In his first bout of the year, the 20-year-old, allowed Turkey’s M Karavus a four-point takedown within the opening 10 seconds of the Ranking Series tournament in Zagreb.
That move seemed to have woken up Sehrawat as it was the only time Sehrawant conceded points in the tournament. Quick and aggressive, Sehrawat steamrolled his opponents, including Karavus against whom the Indian took 10 straight points, to begin the Olympic year with a title.
For Indian wrestling that’s been mired in doom and gloom of player protests, sexual harassment allegations against former president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, international suspension and a domestic flux for a year, this was rare good news.
Better even for Sehrawat’s coach, who was thrilled that the off-season work to improve the wrestler’s slow starts paid off.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There weren’t many tournaments in the last few months but we didn’t stop working even for a day. The entire time was used to improve his starts,” said his coach Lalit Kumar, who was on Tuesday feted with the Dronacharya Award. “It took some time to drill the idea in his mind that if he wants to be at the Olympics and win a medal, he can’t be dheela even for a second on the mat.”
Sehrawat vs Dahiya for Olympic spot
Being at the Olympics and standing on a podium isn’t plain rhetoric. Sehrawat, from Delhi’s Chhatrasal Stadium, is tipped widely to follow the footsteps of the academy’s alumni Sushil Kumar, Yogeshwar Dutt, Bajrang Punia and Ravi Dahiya – all Olympic medallists.
Still in his second year in senior wrestling, the Paris Olympics might have come a little too early for the junior world champion and senior Asian champion in the 57kg weight class. But that hasn’t stopped him from preparing for a potential showdown with Tokyo Olympics silver medallist and his idol Dahiya at the selection trials next month.
The winner of those trials will get the first chance to clinch an Olympic berth at a qualifying event in April. And even that might not be enough to get on the plane to Paris. The final trials for the Paris Olympics are likely to be held on May 31 and June 1 and the winner of that will get a shot at Olympic glory.

Potentially, there could be more than one bouts between the country’s two best lightweight wrestlers to decide who gets to be the sole representative in the 57kg category.
Dahiya, because of his international pedigree, would have been an obvious choice until not too long ago. But Sehrawat’s gradual rise and the Tokyo silver medallist’s bout with injuries have spiced up the contest. The fact that Dahiya lost to a nondescript wrestler from Maharashtra during the Asian Games trials – which Sehrawat won without breaking much sweat – adds another layer to it.
Symbolically, perhaps, Dahiya has chosen France as his venue to compete in his first international tournament in a year. Watching him closely next week would be Sehrawat and his coaches.
“At Chhatrasal, we have always had a problem of plenty so it’s not uncommon to have more than one world-class wrestler in a weight class,” Lalit says. “Both will be well prepared. Ravi has his team and Aman trains with me, as he has since his childhood.”
Stint in Dagestan

At Chhatrasal, Sehrawat’s upper-body strength and quick leg work have been spoken about highly for years. In the last few months, Lalit has worked on improving his reaction time at the start of the bout.

  A post shared by Aman Sehrawat (@amansehrawat057)
It was a major deficiency in Sehrawat’s game, Lalit says, one which was exposed thoroughly during the World Championship last year. “I gave him an earful after that. It was his first year on the senior circuit so everything was new for him but at that moment, we knew that if Aman has to win at major events, he’ll have to start better. He can’t be dheela,” Lalit said.
And so, during the off-season training, he was paired up with partners who were quicker and tested his reaction speed. His diet was modified to increase speed and short sprints were introduced to his routine.

Lalit admits Sehrawat is still a work in progress and to evolve further, the wrestler is set to travel to Dagestan, one of the biggest wrestling hubs in the world. It’s the first time Sehrawat will travel outside India, rather outside Chhatrasal Stadium, for training.
“He’ll spar with new partners since wrestlers from all over the world land there. It’ll open him up to new styles and techniques,” Lalit says. “It’ll be a short stint, just to provide a finishing touch to his preparations before the selection trials next month.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/aman-sehrawat-new-year-title-showdown-ravi-dahiya-paris-2024-9104102/,sports

IND vs AFG: Why India need to find a spot to accommodate Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top?,"With Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli back, India should still find a way to play Jaiswal who has a strike-rate of 158.69.","When India brought back Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli back into the fold for the Afghanistan series, there was this inevitable question as to where they would bat. With Kohli unavailable for Thursday’s T20I because of personal reasons, India are set to open with Rohit and Yashasvi Jaiswal.
But going forward, India head coach hasn’t ruled out the possibility of Rohit and Kohli partnering at the top, a move that totally deviates from the blueprint they have followed for the past 14 months. It also puts a question mark over the place of Yashasvi Jaiswal in the XI, who has by far been their best opening batsman in T20s.

Ex-chief of selectors explains why Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli didn’t play T20Is after T20 World Cup in 2022,Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have reportedly said that they are keen to play in the upcoming T20 World Cup. They last played T20Is for India in November 2022.,"With both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli expressing their willingness to play in the upcoming T20 World Cup, it was no surprise to see both veteran players being named in the Indian squad for the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan which starts from Thursday.
However, this has also led to a lot of chatter about what India’s team compositions will look like going into the T20 World Cup. Both players have not played for the national team in the shortest format of the game since India’s semi-final defeat at the T20 World Cup in November 2022.

Those close to the player feel that the team management has been insensitive to the inevitable frustration that creeps into the minds of those who are constantly benched.

“The injuries are forcing me to quit though I haven’t officially announced retirement. Meantime I wanted to start working with Gopi sir because it would be foolish not to learn from his experience. I started with a batch of u17 and u19s for a month, and he gave me freedom to coach whoever I wanted to.

"From knives hurled at him to persisting with a broken collarbone, the tales that put Franz Beckenbauer with Pele and Maradona as football’s greatest","After his passing at the age of 78, The Indian Express looks at five moments that made Der Kaiser a larger than life footballer.","He may not have conformed to the established archetype of a global phenomenon of a footballer – the likes of which came and since his time have come from Brazil and Argentina – but Franz Beckenbauer is one of the most important figures to have revolutionalised the sport in the 20th century. The German seemed natural on the ball and yet, his was a reputation grafted on hard work rather than god-gifted talent, on technique rather than skills.
In a world that had already witnessed Pele grace the field and was about to witness the greatness of a Diego Maradona, Beckenbauer instilled the value of practice and repetition – and yet, looking effortless. And it was in his elegant beliefs that the German football would craft its image in the years to come.

"Football’s all-conquering Emperor, German great Franz Beckenbauer no more","Beckenbauer, who stopped Cruyff as a player and strangled Diego Maradona as a manager, passes away aged 78","Franz Beckenbauer not just embodied the ideals of German football, its fabled tenacity and indefatigability. But he was German football itself.
One of just three men to have lifted the World Cup as both player and manager, he was arguably the greatest footballer his country has produced, the man who reinvented the role of a defender in the game. He was arguably the greatest leader on the football pitch his country has churned out, whose single-minded defiance upset one of the greatest football teams of all time, the Total Footballers of Johan Cruyff; he was also a legendary manager too, the spiritual figurehead of a raft of managers from his country.

A bigger nod to his personality could be that he stopped Cruyff as a player, and strangled Diego Maradona as a manager.

Stories behind the nickname Kaiser
He owned the most fitting of sobriquets in the game. Der Kaiser. The Emperor. On the field, he exuded an emperor-like aura, in utter control of his men, in absolute mastery of his opponents. Every move was measured; every action was gauged. Even the most rebellious of teammates would listen to his words, as though enamoured by his personality. There are several tales of how he got the moniker.

One of them was that it first came on the cover of a magazine that said he looked like the Bavarian emperor Ludwig II, known as the Fairytale King for his altar-boy look and frizzy curls. There is another spin-off that some of his teammates bestowed the name after a photograph with the bust of former Austrian emperor Franz-Joseph Kaiser.
A more practical tale goes that he, when playing for Bayern Munich, once fiercely marked Schalke’s attacker Reinhard Libuda, who was then known as the King of Westfalen, that his teammates began to call him Kaiser, for only a king could surmount an emperor. Whatever the etymology be, it could not have been ap ter. As a sweeper alone, his legacy in football is immortal.

Inventing sweeper role
ADVERTISEMENT
In an era where sweepers hung back and content repelling waves of attack, he was not merely content with merely tackling or intersecting a ball. But he was involved in play-making and ball-carrying, the prototype of the modern-day sweeper. That he is still regarded as one of the finest in this position is a testament to how good a player he was. He excelled in the dual role, was both silk and steel. He would snatch the ball off the opponent’s feet with the faintest of touches and with equal felicity thread a gorgeous pass upfield. He could impose himself on the most physically imposing of strikers; he could outwit the brainiest of playmakers too. Germany’s masterstroke in the 1974 World Cup was deploying him as the libero, in front of the back four, covering his defenders but with licence to go forward, link with the midfielders and set up attacks.
In Germany, he would become both a pop and cult figure. He was the first German professional with an agent. He was the first who regularly did adverts. He made records. Some of his songs are played at the Allianz Arena, home of Bayern Munich, like true friends can’t be separated.
Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was asked to compare himself with Pele, widely considered to be the greatest to have ever kicked the ball. His answer was detailed and summed up the man and footballer that he was. ‘Look,” he said, ”Pele was a soloist, the best player of all time. I’ve always been a team player, a playmaker, the guy who puts the others in position to score. I made the team move – I can make a team move. Pele cannot do that. But he was a killer,” he elaborated.
Incidentally, he began his career as a centre forward before shifting to left-wing then to central midfield. To every role, he brought energy and creativity. His inspiration was Germany’s 1954 triumph, the Miracle of Bern. Beckenbauer, the son of a postal worker, was nine and he would later recall that he listened to the radio commentary wearing the shirt on which his mother, Antonie, had stitched the No. 10 of Germany’s victorious captain, Fritz Walter. He would then pour into the streets of Munich to share the homecoming of the heroes.

The tales of his courage are legendary. In the 1970 World Cup semi-final against Italy, he dislocated his shoulder during the game. But having exhausted the quorum of substitutes, he had to be on the field. He didn’t flinch either. His right arm strapped to his body and his hand resting below his heart, he fought on. Though Germany lost what was dubbed “The Game of the Century” 4-3, his courage won hearts. His legendary adversary Geoff Hurst, the late England striker, would say: “Beckenbauer showed his character, and still could probably play as well with one arm as most people could with two.” That summed up the spirit of Beckenbauer.
The career was not without the odd sprinklings of grey either. In 2014, he was banned from football for 90 days by Fifa for refusing to cooperate with the inquiry into corruption over the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. The suspension was lifted when he agreed to participate in Fifa’s inquiry, though two years later he was fined 7,000 Swiss francs for his initial refusal.
Nothing though could tarnish the spirit he embodied and how that would come to define German football. Der Kaiser, there would not have been an apter sobriquet.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/franz-beckenbauer-dead-footballs-all-conquering-emperor-germany-der-kaiser-passes-away-9100835/,sports

Usman Khawaja’s appeal against sanction for wearing black armband during 1st AUS vs PAK Test denied by ICC: Report,The ICC reprimanded Khawaja for sporting a black armband on his arm to which the batter appealed,"Usman Khawaja’s appeal against the sanction for him wearing a black armband during the first Test between Australia and Pakistan in Perth, mourning the lives of the children lost amid conflict between Israel and Palestine going on since October last year, has been denied by the International Cricket Council (ICC) according to the reports.
The 37-year-old had initially planned to wear batting spikes with the slogans “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right” inscribed for the Test. The messages were in support of Palestinians in Gaza. He had shown off the messages during a training session before the first Test. However, Cricket Australia and the ICC had contacted him to warn him against what they deemed a political message. Khawaja had abandoned the plan to have the messages on his spikes but had sported the black armband instead.

Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are still great fielders: Sunil Gavaskar on why the duo should play 2024 T20 World Cup,The Indian team will play only three T20 Internationals against Afghanistan before the World Cup in June,"Will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma play in the next T20 World Cup in 2024? This is the biggest question among Indian cricket fans. Earlier, this paper reported that both the star batters are keen and available for selections to play T20Is and have informed the BCCI.
But whether they will be picked is something that remains to be seen. Both players have been continuing to churn out runs and remain the backbone of the team.
Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar feels that their fielding will also be a great help in addition to their batting. “But what makes me feel good is their fielding capacity. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are still great fielders and will be of great help on the field,” he said, speaking on Star Sports.
“Kohli’s form has been outstanding in the last 1.5 years. He played unbelievably in the 2023 World Cup, making 750 runs with three centuries. So there is no doubt about his limited-overs batting,” he added.
The selection committee will meet this week to pick the team for the three T20 games against Afghanistan and the first two Tests against England. The series against Afghanistan starts on January 11, while the five-match Test series versus England begins on January 25.

"From ragged maidans of Old Hyderabad emerges India’s ‘King of quick kill’, Mohammed Siraj","A natural, the fast bowler – the star of India’s series-levelling Test win in South Africa – is unstained by conventions, a product of the milieu, society and culture he grew up in, and groomed by wise men who knew how to harness his potential.","Not all days belong to Mohammed Siraj. But on those days that belong to him, he is the storm in the September Colombo air; or the scorch in the January Cape Town Sun.
Dazzled batsmen cannot pick the cues, cannot spot the difference. He bowls as he always bowls. As if every ball is his first, final and only ball, with the same perturbed face of a rebel, the same energetic strides of a man on the run, the same gung-ho leap of a tiger as he reaches the crease and the same primal scream at the follow-through. If you want to capture the incredible energy it requires to hurl a sphere of leather across a 22-yard strip, just watch Siraj coil, and uncoil, at the crease.

Rohit Sharma has a point but India has too much mud on hands from pitch tinkering,Rohit’s long pitch monologue at the press conference was like the passionate disposition of a star witness in an intense court drama.,"After winning the one-and-half-day Test in Cape Town, Rohit Sharma allowed some righteous anger to kick in. At the press conference after the series was drawn, he expressed the angst that Indian cricketers have lived with for long. Rohit called out those who credited Indian pitches for the team’s incredible home record.
Rohit said that if a Test in India had got over on Day 2, all hell would have broken loose. He wasn’t afraid to point at the ICC’s double standards towards spin and the sub-continent. The Indian skipper made a strong plea: We should be allowed to prepare pitches that suit us and the visiting teams shouldn’t start floating conspiracy theories if it starts turning on the first day.

India vs Australia first T20I: ‘Sorted’ Titas Sadhu shines on a near-perfect night as hosts outplay world champions,"With figures of 4/17, Bengal right armer finished as player of the match as India bounced back in some style from the 0-3 ODI series defeat to outplay the world champions in a thumping 9-wicket win.","Once on a holiday, Titas Sadhu’s father Ranadeep asked her to bowl with the tennis ball while targeting a football goal-post from a distance.

"Two Bihar Ranji Trophy teams turn up on ground, start delayed",The one picked by the BCA president Rakesh Tiwary takes the field. The team with blessings of secretary Amit Kumar left high and dry.,"Patna saw an unusual start to the Ranji Trophy season with two teams, each claiming to represent Bihar, turned up for the game against Mumbai at the Moin-ul-Haq Stadium.

"At 12, Bihar’s Vaibhav Suryavanshi makes Ranji Trophy debut against Mumbai","The lockdown didn’t deter Sanjeev as he started training Vaibhav on a cement pitch at home, after reading about a similar arrangement in a newspaper about how Shubman Gill's father used to train him in Fazilka, Punjab.","Sanjeev Suryavanshi was surprised seeing children aged six or seven playing cricket in the maidans of Mumbai. Suryavanshi, who was struggling to make a living in the metropolis, once asked a coach at Oval Maidan about the right age one should start playing the game. The coach gave him a three-word reply: “Catch them young.”
The incident has proved prophetic as Suryavanshi’s son Vaibhav made his first-class debut at the age of 12 against Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy game at the Moin-ul-Haq Stadium in Patna.
“I was a cricket tragic myself. But in Bihar, let alone cricket, there was no scope for any sport. I moved to Mumbai at the age of 19 and did a lot of jobs, such as working as a bouncer in a nightclub in Colaba, working in a Sulabh toilet or at the port. I used to spend my off days at the Oval Maidan. There young kids playing cricket would be covered by pads and helmets. A few of them were so good that one could watch them for hours. I decided it then only that be it a son or daughter, I will make my children cricketers,” Sanjeev told The Indian Express from Patna.
“Life has come full circle for me. In Mumbai, I dreamt about it, and after all these years, my son made his debut against Mumbai,” he laughs.
After spending 12 years in Mumbai, Sanjeev would return to his hometown, Samastipur in Bihar. His eldest offspring showed no interest in cricket, but the second (Vaibhav), took his first guard as a left-handed batsman when his father presented him a bat on his fifth birthday.
“The next morning I started giving him throw-downs and immediately realised he was a natural. I took him to a local cricket camp, run by Sudhakar Roy (father of former India U-19 cricketer Anukul Roy), and after watching him closely for 15 minutes, he agreed and said ‘Ye to prodigy hai,’” recalls Sanjeev.
In 2019, while enquiring about good cricket academies in Patna, he met coach Manish Ojha. Initially, Manish was not ready to coach Vaibhav.

“He was so small. With pads and helmets on, he used to stumble while running between the wickets. But Sanjeevji insisted I give him personal coaching. Since they came all the way from Samastipur, which is 100km away from Patna, I agreed,” recalls Ojha.
Since then, three times a week, Sanjeev used to bring his son to Patna and the academy of Manish became a second home for the father and son.
“We used to catch an early morning bus at 5 am and by 8 am we used to be at the academy. This was our routine for three days in a week. It carried on for a year, till Covid stopped everything,” says Sanjeev.
Taking inspiration
However, the lockdown didn’t deter Sanjeev as he started training Vaibhav on a cement pitch at home, after reading about a similar arrangement in a newspaper about how Shubman Gill’s father used to train him in Fazilka, Punjab.

“I read somewhere that Gill was good against fast bowling because he used to train on a cement pitch as a child. I started doing the same with Vaibhav,” Sanjeev says.
Coach Manish too had a fair share of struggle against Bihar cricket administrators to give Vaibhav a fair chance.
“In the Hayman Trophy (Inter-district tournament), he scored 620, the most in the tournament. The selectors wanted him to play in the U-16 competition. After hours of argument, they agreed to put him in the U-19 team. My point was that when he was comfortable against cricketers double his age, why not pick him for the senior team,” says Manish.

“In the Vinoo Mankad Trophy, Vaibhav scored 393 runs in five innings, including a century against Haryana. Then, he was picked for the U-19 Challenger Trophy held in Assam. Although he scored only one fifty, he caught the selectors’ attention and was picked for the U-19 Quadrangular series, where he had a couple of fifty-plus scores against Bangladesh and England.”

“Wasim sir was with the Bangladesh U-19 team. He was impressed with Vaibhav’s shot selection. Even VVS Laxman sir told me that he is ready, but they want to see his development in the next couple of years. Such compliments gave us extra motivation,” says Sanjeev.
The one thing that worried Sanjeev was how his son would deal with traveling alone for away Ranji Trophy matches.
“During the quadrangular series, when I came back home from Samastipur, I received a call from Manish sir that Vaibhav was crying on the phone. I had to go back. He has always had me since the day he picked up the bat, but my biggest fear is how he will deal with this situation. I am trying to prepare him for it.

‘Don’t think Steve Waugh is going to care…everybody outside South Africa become experts’: Test coach Shukri Conard,"The Proteas named an uncapped Neil Brand their captain for the series against New Zealand, which is part of the World Test Championship (WTC), South Africa also withdrew from a white-ball series last year against Australia.","South Africa sending a weakened squad to New Zealand for a two-match Test series and preserving the majority of their first team to play SA20 has created a lot of commotion in the cricketing world. Australian legend Steve Waugh was critical of the decision and said, “If I was New Zealand, I wouldn’t even play.”
South African Test coach Shukri Conrad, after a loss to India in the 2nd Test in Cape Town, responded to the remark. “I do not think Steve Waugh is going to care what I say, but I love how everybody outside South Africa has become experts on South African cricket,” he said, as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.
“Our hand has been forced. Everybody understands the SA20 has to happen. SA20 has to happen because it is the lifeblood of South African cricket. If it does not happen, we are not going to have Test cricket anyway,” he added.

The Proteas named an uncapped Neil Brand as their captain for the tour. All but two of the players on the side that beat India in the Boxing Day test are competing in the SA20 league, but David Bedingham and Keegan Petersen will be going to New Zealand.
Earlier in the week, Cricket South Africa released a statement about their situation. “CSA has the utmost respect for the test format as the pinnacle of the game we love.”
“The dates for this tour were set when the Future Tours Programme (FTP) for 2023-2027 was finalised in 2022.
“The window for the SA20 had not been determined at that stage. Once it became apparent that there would be a clash, we made every effort to find another mutually suitable timeslot for this series in consultation with New Zealand Cricket.
“Regrettably the constraints imposed by the global cricket calendar rendered this impossible, as the games must be played before April 2025 as part of the World Test Championship.

Oscar Pistorius released on parole from jail for his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp’s murder,"The South African sprinter fatally shot Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day in 2013. Reeva, who was 29 when she was murdered, was a law graduate and successful model","Olympic and Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius, who has been in jail since 2014 for killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp has been released on Parole on Friday said the South Africa’s Department of Corrections.
The announcement came in the morning around 8:30 AM (South African time), indicating corrections officials had released the Olympic runner from the Atteridgeville Correctional Center in the South African capital, Pretoria, in the early hours.
The South African sprinter fatally shot Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day in 2013. Reeva, who was 29 when she was murdered, was a law graduate and successful model.
Pistorius, meanwhile, was one of the most famous athletes from South Africa, as he competed using carbon-fiber prosthetic legs. Using those prosthetic legs, he won multiple gold medals at the Paralympics and then went on to compete at the London 2012 Olympics.
Pistorius had fired four shots with his pistol through the door of a toilet cubicle at his Pretoria home in the early hours of Valentine’s Day in February 2013.
At his hearings, Pistorius had argued that he had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder and that he thought Steenkamp was sleeping in bed.
The BBC reported that Reeva’s mother, June, had decided to not oppose the athlete’s appeal for parole. Reeva’s father Barry passed away in September last year.
ADVERTISEMENT
The athlete nicknamed as “Blade Runner” was initially sentenced to imprisonment for five years in 2014 for culpable homicide. But that decision from the high court was changed by the Supreme Court of appeal a year later as it found him guilty of murder.
He was sent to jail for six years in 2016 after a high court sentence. In 2017, the supreme court doubled his murder sentence to 13 years and five months.
A report in The Guardian noted that Pistorius was denied parole in March 2023 because he had not completed the minimum detention period required to be eligible for parole.
However, a constitutional court ruled in October that Pistorius had served half of his sentence by March 21 this year, which meant he was eligible for parole, after his sentence was backdated to July 2016 instead of November 2017.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/oscar-pistorius-reportedly-released-on-parole-from-jail-for-his-girlfriend-reeva-steenkamps-murder-9096275/,sports

SA vs IND: Aiden Markram leaves self-doubts behind for counter-attacking century,"Choosing his end to attack, never dropping the bat below the waist, South African opener plays with assured footwork to score memorable 106 off 103 balls on devilish track.","There are two Aiden Markrams out there. India has usually brought out the vulnerable one. The fragile version had the “biggest relief”, according to his long-time mentor Pierre de Bruyn, when Dean Elgar and then Temba Bavuma were made Test captains. It was against India when Markram, just 23 and playing just his third ODI, was made the captain in a ODI series in 2018 and the “next Graeme Smith” collapsed under pressure. In a series where India crushed South Africa 5-1, Markram was so distressed that he didn’t even remember the manner of his dismissal in the final ODI at Port Elizabeth in his post-game chat with an alarmed de Bruyn. A year later, during another nightmarish series in India, after he got out to twin ducks in the Pune Test, he punched a “solid object” in the dressing room and left the tour with a fractured wrist. He would soon be dropped from the team.
“What we saw in Pune was as a build-up, a ticking time bomb,” de Bruyn had told this newspaper. “It was a frustrating tour for him, and the whole captaincy thing that was placed on his shoulders before… That is not Aiden, to go into a change room and hit the cupboard. When that incident happened, I was worried.”

Not for the first time in an era when T20 cricket is the holy grail and the IPL a quick route to entry into the national side, Ranji Trophy — which runs till early February — will struggle for relevance.
Not since the 2016/17 home season so India have as many as 13 Tests lined-up this year. But the diluted Ranji Trophy, sans the best of the rest outside the core of the Test squad, may not be the best yardstick to judge performance for selectors to build a bench for the Test squad.
Coaches of domestic teams are a worried lot.
Rotate ‘A’ squad
To prevent Ranji Trophy matches from being a watered-down affair because of India A engagements that run till February 4 and to have key personnel available, some of the coaches have asked selectors to at least rotate the players.

With the tournament now held in the second-half of the season; December to February instead of end of September to early January — several coaches complain how players, especially fast-bowlers, cite slight niggles to skip games as they don’t want to risk missing out on the IPL, which usually begins in early April.
That the visiting England Lions team has only three Test-capped players, in Ollie Robinson, Keaton Jennings and Alex Lees, isn’t lost on them. India A should be an emerging team comprising Under-23 players, suggests a coach.
“England and Australia will never schedule A series when County cricket or Sheffield Shield is on. When we tour these countries, we do it in the off-season or in the pre-season. This series (England Lions versus India A) could have been played in December. But now we have to lose our players,” another veteran coach said.
But from the national team’s perspective, it is easy to understand why this A series is important. With this being a shadow tour (played alongside the five Test matches between India and England) and coming at the end of a long season that included a World Cup, there are concerns about the fitness of a few Test players.

Two of India’s best spinners aren’t young anymore and the workload may take a toll. And given there are at least four young batsmen in the Test squad, the selectors feel they need to keep the reserves ready. Matches against the England Lions will be key.
But if the Future Tours Programme is prepared in advance, can’t the domestic calendar be planned accordingly. The IPL has forced a change.
Before the Covid years, the Ranji was usually slotted to begin from September end or October first week. But with IPL auctions usually scheduled during this time, the BCCI advanced the Syed Mushtaq Ali and with Ranji Trophy pushed further down.
There are benefits, says WV Raman, former India opener and ex coach of Bengal and Tamil Nadu.

“When you start the tournament early (Sep-Oct), except for the western side, rain will be a factor in other places because of the north-east monsoon. While fog will be an issue in December-January in the northern belt, it doesn’t hamper as much and as the tournament progresses into the last leg, it would only get better. Nowhere in the world can we have conditions which will be ideal for everything,” Raman told The Indian Express.
Playing in this period also means, most of the matches are played on surfaces which have good grass cover, enabling lateral movement and aiding fast bowlers. Sans enough sunshine, pitches usually don’t break easily and have shown a tendency to flatten as the game progresses in some places, which isn’t a common occurrence at the top level.
“Of course during this phase there is nippy movement in some places with bowlers usually enjoying the conditions. You will have moisture in the surface that would aid movement, but you aren’t playing in one particular zone. You get to play in different conditions and build your game,” Raman added.
The Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, the domestic T20 tournament, has relevance because it is a talent-spotting opportunity for IPL scouts before an auction. Playing in the shadow of a high-profile Test series and India A games, the onus will be on a special player to catch the attention of the selectors during the Ranji Trophy.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/is-this-the-right-time-to-play-ranji-trophy-2024-preview-9095568/,sports
Jasprit Bumrah’s tour: Broken heart emoji to a beaming Man of the Series smile,"Setback and heartaches of 2023 thing of past, India's premier fast bowler back to leading from front.","It was a lovely little moment that came at the end of the shortest Test in 90 years in terms of overs bowled. In 107 overs, India had wrapped up a seven-wicket win, adventurously chasing down 79-run target, when Jasprit Bumrah walked up to the presentation ceremony to translate the man-of-the-match winner Mohammad Siraj’s Hindi comments to English for the broadcasters.
That’s when Bumrah was confronted with the task of relaying Siraj’s rave about him to the world. Siraj had talked about how Bumrah assesses the pitch quickly and passes relevant information to him and all he needs to do is to be consistent with that. Bumrah smiled, paused, and then said those words in English but converted it all as a “we”, a group activity rather than take credit, ending with a charming, “And it sometimes helps him (Siraj),” even as a smile creased his face.
There were no smiles before the tour but heart-broken emojis from him that had caused a big flutter in Indian cricket. It was interpreted as a reaction to not being given captaincy of Mumbai Indians when the franchise decided to replace Rohit Sharma with Hardik Pandya. There were no smiles even a couple of months prior to that emoji but apprehension in general at how the all-new Bumrah would bowl after a comeback from a lengthy hiatus to injury.

Neither were there any smiles after the last tour of South Africa where he led the team’s attack along with Mohammad Shami but couldn’t conjure any breakthrough miracles in two Tests, unable to defend a tough 200 plus totals in the last innings. It was batsmen’s failure primarily that they couldn’t give Bumrah and co. generous totals to defend, but the question does raise, especially after the consistently heroic performances in similar situations by world’s best Test bowler Pat Cummins who always finds a way.
Skillful warrior
So, the distant past was smirking, the recent one with IPL heartbreak was raising eyebrows about his state of mind, but it was Bumrah the skillful warrior that turned up in South Africa to win the man of the series. He had already silenced the injury doubters by spectacular performances in the ODI World Cup and now he had firmly shut up the mouths of those who wondered if his body would be a limited-overs bowler or be as effective as before in Tests. It was as much a triumph of body as it was with the mind – and befittingly it came at Cape Town where he had made his Test debut. Circle of life, and all that.
Mind and body willing, he had to still rev himself to do the damage with the ball. Even on Thursday, especially as his team had imploded a day before, losing six wickets for nothing. If South Africa had gotten to a 175-run target, who knows what could happen.
Bumrah dealt a first-over blow to South Africa that must have settled the nerves. He quickly sensed the nervy urge of David Bedingham to attack and forced him to hit a nipbacker on the up; one element was threat enough but the combined forces of the seam movement and vertical lift proved too much and it was nicked to the ‘keeper.
#JaspritBumrah cemented his credentials as one of the finest Test bowlers in world cricket, with a superb 6/61 to set up a manageable target for #TeamIndia!

Late last evening, Bumrah had already produced a pearler, one that kicked up steeply and with force from a length to startle Tristan Stubbs into edging. A similar delivery from Curtly Ambrose was good enough to sort out a young Sachin Tendulkar in the 1992 World Cup and this one with even more vicious lift proved too much for poor Stubbs. It would have troubled even the adult Tendulkar.
From that Bedingham moment on, it was classic Bumrah unleashing not just his wizardry but by his well-thought-out set-ups. It would have been easier for him to just keep hitting the length or back of length to extract bounce to harass the South Africans but he mixed his deliveries so expertly that a highlights reel might show as if batsmen needlessly self-destructed and flayed at deliveries. They didn’t.
Bag full of tricks

Bumrah would make them claustrophobic with his hard lengths and slip in the fuller wider potentially jail-break deliveries and suck them into injudicious drives. It was his version of ‘zeher ka peda’ – a colloquial term from Mumbai maidaans from the past about the over-flighted sucker ball that spinners would bowl, only to fool the batsmen with weighted drops.
Marco Jansen hit a full-ball back to Bumrah, Keshav Maharaj sliced a drive to gully and Lungi Ngidi edged a real full ball that shaped away ever so slightly to slips. In between he had Kyle Verreynne to miscue a pull to mid-on. He nearly would have had South Africa’s best batsman on the day Aiden Markram but an regulation chance was grassed by the wicketkeeper KL Rahul.

Siraj was right. Even in the first innings, Bumrah had led the way, deploying the leg-and-middle line of attack to the left-handers Dean Elgar and Tony de Zorzi. And how to keep it simple to the right-handers on and around the off-stump line.
On a pitch where no ball was ever going to hit the stumps or fetch a lbw (barring one finally from Kagiso Rabada that kept a tad low to surprise Shubman Gill in the second innings), Bumrah was spot on with his lengths. He sowed doubts, Siraj reaped the rewards in the first innings – and it was a solo show in the second to ensure India didn’t have to chase too many.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-sa-jasprit-bumrahs-tour-broken-heart-emoji-to-a-beaming-man-of-the-series-smile-9095507/,sports

The southpaw has had his mark on the Proteas team, especially in the red-ball format. Appreciating his services for the Test game, the Indian skipper, during the post-match presentation, would give a signed Indian jersey to the gritty opener.
“Such an important player for SA, very gritty, we appreciate that. I’d like to wish him the best. A brilliant career, best wishes ahead,” Rohit would say after the game when asked about Elgar.
Elgar and Jasprit Bumrah were awarded the Player of the Series. “Still very proud of my performance that I had in Centurion. Finally on the board there in the hundred club. Nice to contribute to a winning cause. Some really tough batting conditions throughout,” he said.
The 36-year-old had a brilliant Test match with the bat in the first match of the series at Centurion when he was made the side’s captain in the middle of the game due to an injury to standing captain Temba Bavuma on day one. The gritty left-hander did not buckle down. Once again, throughout his career, he has shown he gets better when put under pressure.
Elgar scored a sublime 185 which effectively sealed the game. He was tactically sound on the field with his bowling changes and field placements.

The southpaw was not technically a sound batter but could score his runs through determination and unshakable willpower. He was often compared to South African legendary captain and opening batter Graeme Smith. Elgar also led the South African side and had seen decent success.
The 36-year-old, in 85 Tests, scored 5331 runs at an average of 38.08. He scored 14 tons, with the highest score of 199 runs against Bangladesh.
In December, it was reported by Rapport newspaper that Test coach Shukri Conrad is considering selecting Neil Brand, South Africa A’s captain, as the opening batsman for the series in New Zealand, and Elgar is not in the long-term plans of the coach.

“One thing we have to point out is the technique of the batsmen especially on surfaces that are a bit tricky,” he said.
“The fans have been thoroughly entertained in two days of fascinating cricket. Obviously South Africa won the fir4st one convincingly and then India bounced back convincingly. Both teams obviously played some of their best cricket and also some of their worst cricket.

‘Catches win matches’: Shaheen Shah Afridi rues drop chances off his bowling,Pakistan vice-captain has been rested for the third Test in Sydney to manage his workload ahead of the hectic schedule.,"Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi says the dropped catch of his bowling has cost the team massively in the ongoing Test series against Australia.
“I feel I could have got more wickets. But unfortunately .. take a catch to win the match. Unfortunately ,we missed that opportunity most of the time. It has been a good tour so far. The last Test (MCG) was awesome as a bowling unit and as a team.,” Shaheen told Channel 7 at Lunch on Day 1.
Shaheen, who has picked eight wickets in the first two Tests and looked a bit rusty has been rested for the Sydney Test to manage his workload ahead of the hectic schedule.
“I played two games, and a lot of overs to be honest. They’re just managing my workload, the medical team and team management decided to take a rest for this (Test),” he said.
The pacer also revealed that he follow fellow left-arm pacers Mitchell Starc and Trent Boult very closely.

Simon Katich says unfair to blame David Warner entirely for ‘Sandpaper-gate’ scandal,Katich feels it would be difficult for most of the Australian public to forgive David Warner for his role in the sandpaper-gate scandal.,"Former Australia cricketer Simon Katich says he understands why it is difficult for most of the Australian public to forgive David Warner for his role in the sandpaper-gate scandal but feels it is unfair to blame the opener entirely.
“I think it’s hard to say ‘full respect’ because I think there is always going to be an element of the public that didn’t like what happened, and rightfully so,” Katich told SEN Sportsday NSW.
Warner was adjudged to have played the leading role in the scandal and was banned from elite cricket for a year and from leadership positions for life. Steve Smith was also banned for a year and from leadership positions for three years, while opener Cameron Bancroft was given a one-year ban from leadership positions on top of a nine-month playing suspension.
“A lot of us couldn’t believe what the Australian team resorted to,” said Katich.
“But I think to blame him entirely for that whole episode is pretty naive.”

At the same time Katich is impressed with how Warner has git himself back to playing cricket at such a high level despite receiving so much backlash.
“I think in time, I’ve got no doubt there will be more said about it,” Katich said.

“He took the wrap along with Cameron Bancroft and Steve Smith but I think, the public feel there was more to it than just those three.
“At the time, I think what he did was he kept his mouth shut after the initial apology and then got on with trying to go back out there and try to play as good as cricket as he possibly could. That wouldn’t have been easy to do.
“What’s done is done but for David to be able to get back to where he got to after such an enormous event like it was in Cape Town… it was significant to think that he was able to get back and play good cricket after that event.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/simon-katich-says-unfair-to-blame-david-warner-entirely-for-sandpaper-gate-scandal-9092793/,sports

Rafael Nadal sends positive vibes in comeback match with straight-sets win over Dominic Thiem,"The win marked Nadal's 1069th at the ATP tour, taking him over Ivan Lendl as the fourth highest on the all time tally. ","Rafael Nadal put any concern about rustiness to bed following his year-long injury layoff, defeating 2020 US Open champion Dominic Thiem 7-5, 6-1 in routine fashion in the first round of the Brisbane International on Tuesday.
Nadal, playing his first singles match since suffering a hip flexor injury in his second-round defeat at last year’s Australian Open, looked razor-sharp from the get-go, typically taking command with his big forehand and dominant play from the baseline. His serve was especially accurate, winning 90 percent of the points on his first serve and two-thirds of them on his serve in total. His movement was sharp, and he also put in plenty of returns back in play.
“Today is honestly an emotional and important day for me after probably one of the toughest years of my tennis career,” the Spaniard was quoted as saying by Reuters after the match.
“I had the chance to come back after a year and play in front of an amazing crowd and play at a very positive level on the first day is something that makes us feel proud – my team and family who have been there every day in the last year.”

— Tennis TV (@TennisTV) January 2, 2024
Nadal asserted, later in his press conference, that he was happy to overcome any lingering fears regarding his competitive level with a confidence-boosting win.
“For me, the main thing is (to) stay healthy. I really think that I didn’t forget how to play tennis. The only thing that’s going to be difficult (is) to make it in a professional match and at a very high level of tennis,” he said.
“You need to recover the confidence and the movements. That takes time. After the surgery, you feel scared sometimes to do a kind of movement and you need to recover the speed and reading the ball and (doing) things in an automatic way.”
Another comeback bid
Thiem, a former World No.3 himself who is looking to return to his competitive best after spending a few seasons in and around the top 100, turned out to be a valiant sparring partner for Nadal, showing glimpses of his former self in a high-quality first set.

Despite leaking too many errors, the Austrian’s power was telling during most of the baseline exchanges, forcing Nadal to elevate his game at the back end of the set to find the breakthrough and convert a fourth break point in the 12th game to take the opening set. The intensity and shot-making on display in that period was reminiscent of some of the best tennis during the duo’s consecutive French Open finals in 2018 and 2019, both of which Nadal won.
@RafaelNadal is absolutely amazing! Having not played in more than 350 days after hip surgery, beating @domithiem 7:5 6:1 in the first round in Brisbane
— Boris Becker (@TheBorisBecker) January 2, 2024
There was no looking back for him from there, who took the initiative early in the second set, breaking in Thiem’s first service game and consolidating his position further from there.
“You need hours on court, hours in a practice session, but at the same time hours in professional matches,” Nadal would later say. “I (didn’t) know what could happen today. It’s a day to be happy. I am excited to have the chance to play another time.”
Despite having made several injury comebacks in the past, most recently at the 2022 Australian Open where he returned from surgery to win the title after coming back from a two-set deficit in the final, this is the first time in his career that Nadal has been forced to return to his best after such a long period away from competitive action.
With uncertainty regarding the level he will be able to return at, a solid performance and win bodes well for his hopes to script another fairytale in Melbourne, where the Australian Open kicks off on January 14. Nadal has proven in the past that he should not be counted out after returning from injury layoffs. But the elite field has several Major contenders – including 10-time champion and World No.1 Novak Djokovic as well as exciting 20-year-old World No.2 Carlos Alcaraz.

They all look and feel the same. Just the names and characters change. The latest trip is unfolding like the nine others to the country. The usual themes have played out—lost opportunities, false hopes and swift implosions, the pain numbed somewhat by stirring individual performances. A twist here, a tweak there, the script takes the much-trodden route.

Instead of Durban 1996 read Centurion 2023.
Now, they reach Cape Town, a venue that evokes the splendor of nature as well as bitter memories. Twice have India landed in the Western Cape with the hope of conquering the final frontier; twice they left the city battered.

Pat Cummins on the perfect farewell for David Warner: ‘A hundred and a leg spinner to take the last wicket’,"The Australian captain was all praise for Warner, who also announced his retirement from the ODIs earlier this week, and spoke highly of the southpaw's contributions to the dressing room.","All is in readiness for David Warner to take the field in his final Test match for Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground starting Wednesday against Pakistan. The southpaw’s 112th Test match has been the big talk this week in Australia and skipper Pat Cummins has visualized the perfect scenario for the curtains to come down upon his opener’s career.
“Best-case scenario is a hundred and maybe a leg-spinner to take the last wicket of the game out of the rough,” Cummins would grinningly tell members of the press on Tuesday at the SCG.
“[Hopefully there is] just a fantastic turnout here, which I’m sure it will be with everyone behind him. If he could score some runs and go off in style with a few fours and sixes, I think that’d be a pretty fitting end. ‘Warner Week’ has started,” he added.
Cummins was all praise for the southpaw, who also announced his retirement from the ODIs earlier this week, and referred to his contributions beyond the runs.
“We spend a lot of time on the road and it can be monotonous, but with Davey, it never is. There is always something going on. He always brings plenty of energy to the group. If the group is a little low on energy, he ramps it up a bit and gets us up and going,” Cummins said.
On the conditions at play in Sydney, the Aussie skipper added,  “The weather looks pretty good this week and that’s not always the case in Sydney. I had a look yesterday and [the pitch] looks good. The groundsman seems happy with where it’s at. It looks like decent coverage of grass, so it should be a good week ahead.”

Two of the big questions for 2024: Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for T20 World Cup? PR Sreejesh or Krishan Pathak for Paris?,"It’s the year the country picks its leader and the men to take the country forward, to embrace incumbency or winds of change; it is also the year the world of Indian sports has to make tough and definite decisions in its quest for medals and trophies, but without the choice of a ballot.","Should Rohit, Virat play T20 World Cup?
It’s not about sentiments, to give Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli potentially one last shot at winning the T20 World Cup. But there is no reason to look beyond them. Kohli was the tournament’s highest run-getter and played one of the all-time great T20 knocks by an Indian batsman. He hasn’t played another T20I since India’s semifinal exit in the 2022 World Cup, but enjoyed a prosperous IPL. The tally of 639 runs is his second-best run-haul ever, so is the strike rate that is a nudge below 140. If any, he has only reinvigorated his T20 game and looks in no mood to slow down.
Rohit’s recent T20I outings have not been quite eye-catching. but the freedom he displayed in the ODI World Cup is a reliable indicator of his mindset and method. A cricketer like him should not be valued merely through the prism of numbers in a particular format, but his recent form, even if it be in other formats. Little doubt that Rohit was India’s tempo-setter in the 50-over World Cup, the pin-up boy of their gung-ho approach. Though a spate of openers have performed in recent T20Is—Sai Sudharsan the most promising of them—Rohit towers above them all with his body of work, as it is with Kohli.

The sport for him had been more of a pastime at WITS, while he pursued a degree in sports psychology. Playing what little club cricket he had until that point of time was a soothing comfort after his short romance with Tennis.","Neil Levenson couldn’t contain his excitement. The year was 2014 and the cricket coach at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) in Johannesburg thought he’d just seen the future of South Africa’s pace bowling. He recognised that there was still a lot to work on – technical stuff such as the alignment from the landing foot to the release point – but all of that didn’t matter. The coach had seen enough – in one nets session – to be firm in his belief. And so, he made it known to the boy himself. “You could play professional cricket and bowl at 140kph.” There was however one tiny matter of concern.
Nandre Burger didn’t want to become a professional cricketer. The sport for him had been more of a pastime at WITS, while he pursued a degree in sports psychology. Playing what little club cricket he had until that point of time was a soothing comfort after his short romance with Tennis. Harboring ambitions to be on the ATP tour, teenage Nandre would litter the YouTube with searches of Roger Federer’s play compilations. With that and the coaches at his high school, Nandre had developed a nigh unplayable serve. However, it would be the unbecoming of his five-year obsession as the 15-year-old started developing back spasms and was forced into quitting the racquet sport.

"2024 promises more of 2023: Ronaldo-Messi’s rivalry, Guardiola’s evolution, Saudi’s Europe assault","Among the half-inevitabilities: England’s wait for winning the continental tournament would continue. They were runners-up last edition, they have a stronger team this time, but they would still devise ways to implode.","Some footballing inevitabilities of the New Year: The two ageless emperors of our times, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, would continue their journey into timelessness. Pep Guardiola would continue his maniacal obsession to evolve, to enrich the game with more than just trophies and medals, but embellish the game with something truly immortal; Manchester United would envisage new ways to flounder their glorious heritage; Saudi would keep shelling out incredible sums to lure the best of Europe.
Messi turns 37 in June. Cristiano Ronaldo becomes 39 at the stroke of February. Both have achieved so much that you wonder what more they could achieve in football, or what more they need to achieve in the game. The World Cup dream fuels Ronaldo. It’s the only vacuum in his trophy-chest. He would be 41 by then. But nothing would stop them—he is scoring goals as frequently as he had in Europe. No one scored as many goals as Ronaldo in 2023 (54 goals in 59 appearances for Al Nassr and Portugal). No mean feat in the shriveling heat of Saudi Arabia, the standards steadily improving with the influx from Europe. No one netted more goals (10) in the Euro 2024 qualifiers than Ronaldo either. Maybe, he will play as long as Messi does. The sport has not seen a rivalry as long-lasting as theirs, two individuals turning a team-game into a perennial two-man race for the throne of the greatest footballer ever. It could be that football does not want them to leave them, more than them wanting to leave them.

India versus Australia: Cut shot proves to be fatal for Indian batsmen in Indore like the sweep was for Australia in Delhi,"Cheteshwar Pujara, Shreyas Iyer, and Ravindra Jadeja were all dismissed playing ill-judged cut shots on a turning track with uneven bounce.","In a rare show of rage, Cheteshwar Pujara shook his head and kept hitting the turf as he staggered back to the pavilion. Just eight overs and two balls of the morning had passed on, the ball was deviously spitting and spatting. Left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann had removed the openers, when the most old-school of India’s batsman, Pujara, his 101 Tests build on steel and resolve, shaped to cut Nathan Lyon.
Perhaps, it might have been pure muscle memory or instinct. Subcontinental batsmen like to cut spinners off the stumps and from length. One of the finest of them was their coach Rahul Dravid himself, who was audacious enough to back-cut even the wizardly Muttiah Muralitharan. But his successors are not as gifted with neither the wrists or wisdom. This ball was pitched far from the off-stump, and at a cuttable length for subcontinental batsmen; Pujara is a fine exponent of the cut too.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-border-gavaskar-trophy-india-versus-australia-cut-shot-proves-to-be-fatal-for-indian-batsmen-in-indore-8473875/,sports

"Just Fontaine, who scored 13 goals at 1958 World Cup, dies",The highest scorer at the World Cup is now acknowledged with the Golden Boot. Fontaine set the record when FIFA did not present a specific award for the tournament's top scorer.,"Just Fontaine, the French soccer great who scored a record 13 goals at the 1958 World Cup, has died. He was 89. Fontaine’s former club Reims announced his death on Wednesday.
Fontaine took six games to achieve his feat at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, when he was a last-minute inclusion on the French squad.
Entering the tournament, the Moroccan-born Fontaine was a little-known forward outside of the French league. Yet he tormented opponents with his speed and finishing touch — and even with someone else’s boots. He had to borrow a pair of cleats after damaging his own boots in practice.
Fontaine scored four goals in the third-place game against West Germany, but could have had five if he had taken the penalty kick.
The highest scorer at the World Cup is now acknowledged with the Golden Boot. Fontaine set the record when FIFA did not present a specific award for the tournament’s top scorer.

“Beating my record? I don’t think it can ever be done,” Fontaine told The Associated Press in a 2006 interview.
“The person who wants to beat me has a massive task, doesn’t he? He has to score two goals per game over seven games.” Playing in the days when no substitutions were allowed, France lost 5-2 in the semifinals against a Brazil team featuring 17-year-old Pele.
Fontaine, who scored in every match, gave France an early lead with the first goal Brazil allowed in the tournament. But at 1-1, France defender Robert Jonquet broke his leg. Amazingly, he played on, trying to contend with the genius of Pele, but the French defense was considerably weakened.

The record for most goals scored in a World Cup career is 16 by Germany striker Miroslav Klose, who played in four tournaments. Fontaine, who broke the record of 11 goals Hungary striker Sándor Kocsis scored at the 1954 tournament, only played at one World Cup. Fontaine’s meteoric rise as a scorer saw him get 200 goals in 213 games. He scored 30 goals in 21 games for France.

R Ashwin replaces Anderson as No.1 ranked Test bowler,Ashwin claimed the top spot after taking six wickets in India's emphatic victory over Australia in the second Test in New Delhi. Anderson dropped to second place after England's stunning loss to New Zealand in the Wellington Test.,"Veteran Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin on Wednesday jumped to the top of the latest ICC Men’s Test Bowling Rankings, replacing England pacer James Anderson.
Ashwin claimed the top spot after taking six wickets in India’s emphatic victory over Australia in the second Test in New Delhi. Anderson dropped to second place after England’s stunning loss to New Zealand in the Wellington Test. The 36-year-old Ashwin first claimed the top honour among Test bowlers in 2015, and has returned to the top spot on several occasions since then.
Ashwin bagged big wickets in India’s win in Dehli, removing Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith in the same over of the first innings before returning to pick up Alex Carey for a duck. The off-spinner was at it again in the second innings, picking up three of the top five while his spin-bowling accomplice Ravindra Jadeja rattled through the rest of the Australia batters from the other end.

Novak Djokovic says return to top spot more special after tough year,Djokovic missed the 2022 Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19 before returning this year to clinch a record-extending 10th title at Melbourne Park and 22nd major to reclaim the number one spot.,"Novak Djokovic said his return to the top of the world rankings felt like a big achievement after a year of turmoil where he had to skip several tournaments including two Grand Slams, but the Serbian expects a see-sawing battle for the position in 2023.
Djokovic missed the 2022 Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19 before returning this year to clinch a record-extending 10th title at Melbourne Park and 22nd major to reclaim the number one spot.
He was forced out of big tournaments in the United States last year, including the U.S. Open, as he was unable to enter the country due to his refusal to take his shots.

Ben Stokes’s shaky knee to cloud England’s Ashes buildup,"While Stokes had no regrets about enforcing the follow-on in the one-run defeat in Wellington, he had plenty about the state of his left knee which had him grimacing in pain throughout the drawn two-test series.","England head home from New Zealand with the rare sting of defeat after the Black Caps’ ‘Miracle at the Basin’ and more than a little concern over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes a few months out from the Ashes.
While Stokes had no regrets about enforcing the follow-on in the one-run defeat in Wellington, he had plenty about the state of his left knee which had him grimacing in pain throughout the drawn two-test series.
Knee trouble has long bothered Stokes but he has soldiered on through 10 test wins in 12 matches since taking charge of England last year.
Things appeared to have come to a head in Wellington, though, where the all-rounder managed to bowl only two overs and was in all sorts of bother when batting despite making 60 runs.
A reliable wicket-taker who often makes things happen with the ball, Stokes’ seam bowling was not needed in the first innings as New Zealand were bundled out for 209.
However, England’s bowlers might have yearned for their captain’s support after he enforced the follow-on and put them in the field again.
New Zealand went on to rack up 483 against them as they tired and set a chase that England fell just short of.

Rather than rest up for the three-and-a-half months before the Ashes, Stokes will be heading to the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting March 31 to fulfil his $2 million deal with the Chennai Super Kings.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan called on Stokes to forgo the IPL to boost his chances of being fully fit for the Ashes which start in Birmingham on June 16.
Stokes wasn’t having it.
“I’ve been working hard with the physios and the medics out here to try to get myself into a place where I can fill that (bowling) role like how I have done the last 10 years or however long it is,” he said in Wellington.
“I’ve got a four-month period now to get it, sort of, even better before that Ashes because I want to be turning up in Birmingham being able to fill that role properly.”

‘I’m not going to be MS Dhoni as a captain’: RCB’s Faf du Plessis ahead of IPL 2023,"While speaking on RCB Podcast Season 2, the second of the 10 episodes, Faf disclosed his idea of captaining the side and what he has learnt from former IPL skippers.","Faf du Plessis took over the captaincy of Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of IPL 2022, and he had a lofty legacy to live up to.
In his first season as RCB captain, Faf displayed exceptional leadership qualities while guiding the team to the IPL Playoffs.
While speaking on RCB Podcast Season 2, the second of the 10 episodes, Faf disclosed his idea of captaining the side and what he has learnt from former IPL skippers.
“I think what was really good for me to go through was, even with all of that, the conviction that I am not going to be Graeme Smith as a captain, I’m not going to be Stephen Fleming as a captain, I’m not going to be MS Dhoni as a captain. In order for me to be true to who I am as a person, I need to be me. Because if you’re not being you, then people will see through it, maybe not when you’re doing well but definitely when you are under pressure, or underperforming, the real you will reveal itself,” said Faf.
Speaking about what drove him to lead the team with a sense of purpose, he said, “I think as a cricketer, the moment that reaffirmed to me and told me that I belong at this level and I want to be at this level… was (the moment) like, you belong here. So that moment was from where, I was just like, this is what I want to do. Yeah, I became super purpose driven. After that, I became the Proteas, the Heartbeat if I could say that. I lived and breathed everything about Cricket South Africa.

“Then now at this next chapter in my life, I found this new purpose and especially now with RCB, as I said you’ve got something that really lights your desire inside you. Yeah, I want to do something special and then that gives you a new sense of purpose because I don’t want to play just for the sake of playing. There’s always something that drives me more than just the Rands or whatever,” said Faf.
Faf was immense not just as a leader, as he led the RCB batting too from the front. Faf amassed 468 runs from 16 matches with 3 fifties including the highest of 96. In fact, Faf was seventh among the leading run-scorers of the IPL 2022.
However, Faf had to do that proverbial learning and unlearning while maturing into the role of a captain. For that, Faf credited the days he spent observing proven leaders such as former SA captain Graeme Smith and MS Dhoni and Stephen Fleming during his stint with the Chennai Super Kings.

RCB skipper Faf du Plesis practicing in the nets.
“I always had this leadership perspective of learning from great leaders, it (leadership) was always something that I was fascinated about. When I initially came into the South African team, Graeme Smith was the captain. I was like, Wow, this guy’s got an amazing presence when he speaks — like this big, blinding roar at you, and he just dominated the room while speaking. So I was like, that’s a leader, right?,” he said.
However, Faf was soon familiarised with an altogether different school of leadership, propagated by MS Dhoni at CSK when he joined the team in 2011.
“I got an opportunity to go to Chennai as a young-ish phase in my career. Stephen Fleming is one of the great leaders within the game, obviously, for New Zealand cricket also. The different aspect was him being a man manager, a guy who just works on relationships. And I go, Wow, that’s impressive. During my first season at CSK, I was sitting next to him (Fleming) and just asked him questions about captaincy and leadership, just to learn as much as I can. And then you put MS on top of that, and you go, Wow, this guy’s tactically odd to read the game like this. And you go, Okay, he is impressive as a captain.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma survives two close calls in Mitchell Starc’s first over,Rohit Sharma got a couple of reprieves in the very first over but has not made it count.,"The Third India vs Australia Test started with a thrill at Indore when Indian skipper Rohit Sharma nicked the first ball from Mitchell Starc.

The incident took place in the second half of the Feb. 4 game — which United won 2-1 at home — where Casemiro was shown a straight red card for appearing to grab Will Hughes by the throat when both teams clashed following a tackle on Antony.
United accepted the that they had failed to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from provocative behaviour but Palace had denied the charge.
“An independent Regulatory Commission subsequently found the charge against Crystal Palace proven and imposed both of the clubs’ fines,” the FA said.

FIFA faces questions for supermodel role before Women’s W Cup,"A former Australia national-team player, Dodd also recalled recent speculation FIFA could sign the Saudi Arabia tourism board as an official sponsor of the month-long tournament that starts July 20.","FIFA’s choice of Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima as its first global fan ambassador five months before the Women’s World Cup was described Tuesday as “tone deaf” by the former leader of the soccer body’s task force for women’s soccer.
Lima’s appointment to “develop, promote and participate in several global initiatives” was announced by FIFA on Monday hours before the former Victoria’s Secret runway model helped present the fan prize in Paris at its annual award ceremony.
“Seriously, FIFA, is this the fan engagement ambassador we need as the (Women’s World Cup) approaches?” wrote Moya Dodd, who was part of the co-hosting bid campaign for her native Australia and New Zealand, on her Twitter account.
Dodd, a former FIFA executive committee member and longtime advocate for women’s soccer, used the hashtag “tonedeaf” and posted the glamor photo from the profile of Lima’s Twitter account that has 2.4 million followers.
A former Australia national-team player, Dodd also recalled recent speculation FIFA could sign the Saudi Arabia tourism board as an official sponsor of the month-long tournament that starts July 20.

“Honestly baffled by the marketing strategy. First FIFA wants to send an LGBTQ-friendly audience to ‘Visit Saudi’,” Dodd wrote. “Now it’s targeting who exactly?”
Lima was photographed Monday in Paris at the FIFA gala event with its president Gianni Infantino and posted on Twitter her new role “means the world to me.”

She also posted to her 15.4 million followers on Instagram: “It is a great honor to be part of the FIFA Family.”
“As a fan myself, I hope to connect at a greater level this family to the life of this beautiful sport: the fans!” she wrote.
FIFA did not specify details Monday of the projects involving Lima, nor if it would involve the biggest-ever marquee women’s tournament which now has 32 teams.
“When you get to meet Adriana, you feel right away her warmth, kindness, and how approachable and passionate she is about our game,” Infantino said Monday in the FIFA statement.

“She lives and breathes ‘futebol’ and that is also why she can be an excellent link between FIFA and fans worldwide,” he said.
FIFA noted Lima is a “supermodel, actress and businesswoman” but offered no details about her links to the sport besides being a fan. Lima posted her condolences after Pelé’s death in December.
Infantino and Dodd served together on FIFA’s ruling committee for more than a year after he was elected in 2016.
She was the first woman, in 2013, to represent the Asian soccer confederation at FIFA and gained a reputation as an independent voice during the presidency of Sepp Blatter. Dodd lost her re-election bid four years later to an opponent from Bangladesh.

While You Were Asleep: Foden stars as Man City advance in FA Cup; Leicester upset,The England winger is over his injury problems and back in favor with City manager Pep Guardiola — and is repaying the faith with goals as the English champions head into the final stretch of the season on the hunt for more trophies.,"Phil Foden was in danger of becoming one of the forgotten players at Manchester City this season.
Maybe not anymore.
The England winger is over his injury problems and back in favor with City manager Pep Guardiola — and is repaying the faith with goals as the English champions head into the final stretch of the season on the hunt for more trophies.
Foden scored in each half in City’s 3-0 win at second-tier Bristol City in the FA Cup on Tuesday, helping the team secure a place in the quarterfinals.
Kevin De Bruyne netted the other goal at Ashton Gate as City stayed on course in a competition it last won in 2019.
Foden lost his place as a regular starter at City just before the World Cup and after returning from the Qatar tournament has been overshadowed by fellow wingers Jack Grealish and Riyad Mahrez.

Now Guardiola has an embarrassment of riches in the wide positions with Foden over some foot injuries and shining again. He scored against Bournemouth on Saturday and was probably City’s best player against Bristol City on a night star striker Erling Haaland was rested.
“This season he struggled a bit and was a bit down,” Guardiola said of Foden. “But now he’s back for the best bit of the season. His impact has been amazing. Football pays off when you work like he does.”
Foden converted a cross from Mahrez in the seventh minute to give City the lead and then provided the side-footed finish — via a deflection from a covering home defender — to make it 2-0 in the 74th.

“I feel 100% fit now and comfortable,” Foden said. “(It has) been one of the worst parts of my career but everyone goes through them and it is how you react.”
De Bruyne curled in City’s best goal of the game in the 81st from outside the area.
City has reached at least the semifinals in five of the last six seasons.
LEICESTER STUNNED
There will be at least one non-Premier League team in the last eight of the FA Cup.

Blackburn, which plays in the second-tier Championship, provided the shock of the evening by winning 2-1 at Leicester, the 2021 champion.
Tyrhys Dolan capitalized on a sloppy pass out from the back by Daniel Amartey to open the scoring for Blackburn before Sammie Szmodics dribbled through the soft center of Leicester’s defense before poking in a finish shortly after halftime.
Kelechi Iheanacho scored his customary FA Cup goal — it’s now 18 in his last 24 appearances in the competition, more than any other player in that time — but Leicester couldn’t grab an equalizer.
Leicester can now focus all its attention on staying in the Premier League. The team is only three points above the relegation zone.
FULHAM’S SENSATION
ADVERTISEMENT
Manor Solomon scored for a fourth straight game to help Fulham beat Leeds 2-0 and continue its excellent season, in which the London club is also impressing in sixth place in the Premier League.
Solomon is an Israel winger who joined on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk in the offseason but missed almost the entire first half of the season because of injury.
Now that he is healthy, he has been starring off the bench — his previous three goals came as a substitute — but was handed a start against Leeds and scored again after playing a one-two with Aleksandar Mitrovic and curling into the far corner.

Joao Palhinha’s opening goal was even better, the Portugal midfielder intercepting a pass out from the back by Tyler Adams and bending in a shot off the post from 30 meters.
In the second half, there were five U.S. internationals on the field at Craven Cottage — Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson for Fulham and Weston McKennie, Brenden Aaronson and Adams for Leeds.

Paris Saint Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi investigated for ‘torture and kidnapping’,"Several months ago, Benabderrahmane had filed a complaint against Al-Khelaifi accusing the PSG honcho of torturing him in Qatar in 2020 due to him possessing documents containing compromising information on Al-Khelaifi.","Paris Saint Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi is being investigated for the alleged kidnapping and torture of Franco-Algerian lobbyist Tayeb Benabderrahmane, according to various reports.
Several months ago, Benabderrahmane had filed a complaint against Al-Khelaifi accusing the PSG honcho of torturing him in Qatar in 2020 due to him possessing documents containing compromising information on Al-Khelaifi.
Now, three French judges have been appointed to launch an investigation into the aforementioned incident.
Reacting to the news, Al-Khelaïfi said as quoted by The Sun, “You are talking about professional criminals. They’ve changed their lawyers more times than they’ve changed their stories and their lies. It is the ultimate media manipulation. I’m just amazed so many people have taken their lies and contradictions as credible – but that’s the media world we’re in today. Justice will run its course – I don’t have time to talk about petty professional criminals.”
The information that Benabderrahmane has may implicate the PSG president in some form of wrongdoing related to the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar or even the awarding of television rights for the Middle East for the 2026 and 2030 World Cups to BeIN Media, according to media reports.
In June last year, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court had acquitted Al-Khelaifi for the second time of the accusations of his accepting bribes and criminal mismanagement to award the World Cup broadcast rights.
Al-Khelaifi, who is also the President of the beIN Media Group, had been under the clouds of suspicion regarding the same over the past few years and was also cleared of the charges during an initial trial in 2020 by the Federal Penal Tribunal, but the Public Ministry of the Confederation then launched an appeal.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/paris-saint-germain-president-nasser-al-khelaifi-investigated-for-torture-and-kidnapping-8472112/,sports
Mithun Manjunath beats Priyanshu Rajawat for badminton national title,"A first-time finalist, Mithun had also ousted perennial Nationals performer and serial retriever, Sourabh Verma in the quarters.","After countering two of India’s best attacking players in two days – Priyanshu Rajawat beaten 21-16, 21-11 after Kidambi Srikanth – Mithun Manjunath completed a dream week at the Senior Nationals. His hand tattoo – a Viking wolf – reads ‘Trust the process’, and after the string of wins in Pune over some of India’s finest, Mithun might well begin to trust what his team at the Padukone academy started 4-5 months ago – slap him into shape to prepare him for the step-up to the international level.
“We’ve changed his diet a bit. He was always on the heavier side, in the lower body especially. Because he believed if he lost bulk, he might lose his strength. He’s changing now,” coach Sagar Chopda would say.
Against Rajawat, Mithun countered by not allowing him too many opportunities to go on his attacking spree – the Dhar lad’s strength. While Srikanth couldn’t be curbed completely in the semis – his smashes still raining down – Mithun cut out all avenues for the aggressive Rajawat. “Priyanshu is also very quick on the net. Mithun countered by keeping him away from the net,” Chopda said. The 24-year-old would respond by keeping the shuttle assiduously in the court.
A first-time finalist, Mithun had also ousted perennial Nationals performer and serial retriever, Sourabh Verma in the quarters. “It’s been a pretty good experience, and beating three big names means it feels great to be a National champion,” Mithun would add.
What struck the most was his absolute calm when playing the attacking duo on back-to-back days. “I used to think a lot earlier. Now I just take it point by point,” he would say, comparing it to times when he could whack the shuttle to pulp and send it wide and long out of frustration from a previous point. “During COVID, I started meditating. But it’s the fitness changes that have brought the results and are a turning point,” he would add.
Asked what he has sacrificed the most, he would quip: “My 6 a.m. sleep!”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/mithun-manjunath-beats-priyanshu-rajawat-for-badminton-national-title-8472109/,sports

"Get back to work – Man United not resting on laurels, says Erik Ten Hag",The Old Trafford side beat Newcastle United in the League Cup final on Sunday to lift a major trophy for the first time since the 2017 Europa League.,"An enthusiastic Manchester United squad have settled down following the euphoria of winning their first trophy in six years to focus on their FA Cup clash with West Ham United, manager Erik ten Hag said on Tuesday.
The Old Trafford side beat Newcastle United in the League Cup final on Sunday to lift a major trophy for the first time since the 2017 Europa League.
“Of course, yesterday the players were still enthusiastic and they had to celebrate this momentum,” Ten Hag told reporters ahead of Wednesday’s fifth-round Cup tie against West Ham.
“But yesterday, after we settled down, we get back to work. What we had to do was recovery and the ones who played less (in the final) did a good training session.
“Nothing beyond, eh? Get back to work!”
Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax Amsterdam last year, had been under pressure when they lost their first two games of the season but the Dutchman said the key was not to panic.
“I know from experience of previous jobs it takes time before you get into a way of playing, before you get into the rules of principles,” he said.
“The right results weren’t there at the start of the season. I didn’t panic because it was part of the process. You find out a lot in those weeks – when you lose it’s not nice, you hate to lose but you also get some good lessons.”

Spurs play away at Championship (second-tier) side Sheffield United in the FA Cup on Wednesday, a game that comes too soon for Conte.

"No Ma Long, but Table Tennis Star Contender has enough stalwarts to attract fans","Unprecedented interest from top players, but many had to miss out due to world body’s restrictions.","When organisers of World Table Tennis (WTT) Star Contender Goa received entries for the main event, that begins in Panaji on Wednesday, they were astounded.
Ma Long, two-time Olympic singles champion and three-time world champion had decided to compete at the event.
Now, Long is to table tennis what Lionel Messi is to football, Roger Federer is to tennis, and Tom Brady is to NFL. To see him compete live in India would be a dream come true for lovers of the sport.
It was also the first time that the organisers received as many as 17 entries from top-20 players in both men’s and women’s singles. Apart from Long, they included current Olympic women’s champion Chen Meng. Unfortunately, WTT has a Play Down Restriction (PDR) meaning that only the top 6 of the top 20 players can feature in the Star Contender event. That meant the organisers had an arduous task of telling at least seven top-20 players that they couldn’t come to Goa.
In further disappointment, just as the billboards screaming of Long’s presence in the country were up and fans had booked tickets with the anticipation of seeing the legend as well as the top Chinese contingent playing in the country, WTT announced that Long, Meng, women’s World No. 1 Sun Yingsha and World No. 3 Wang Manyu, and men’s World No. 3 Wang Chuqin had pulled out of the tournament with either Covid or injury, just two days before the start of the main draw.
While that was a dampener, China sent four other players as replacements for their top players.
Despite the withdrawals, with WTT nominations and wildcards, the event will see as many as 11 top-20 players in men’s singles and 10 top-20 players in women’s singles.
Big events, big names
ADVERTISEMENT
It’s the first time that India is hosting a WTT event and that’s thanks to International Table Tennis Federation’s (ITTF) partnership with Stupa Sports Analytics, a company based in Delhi that specialises in performance analytics and event management. A Star Contender event is third in the hierarchy of table tennis tournaments, below WTT Grand Smash and Champions. The qualifying rounds of the event began at the Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Indoor Stadium in Panaji on Monday.
Megha Gambhir, CEO of Stupa, said the unprecedented response may be due to the fact that its being held in Goa.
“One of the primary reasons we chose Goa is because it’s a tourist destination. We thought that since it’s the first time we’re having a WTT event in India, the players and fans should have something more to look forward to than just table tennis. Normally, it takes a year’s planning to host an event of such magnitude but we’ve done it in a short span of two months. That’s because we’ve received phenomenal support from the government, Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI), and all the stakeholders,” Megha told The Indian Express.
World No. 1 Fan Zhendong of China is the top seed in the men’s event and will be challenged by World No. 4 Tomokazu Harimoto, the lone Japanese in the top-20 of the world rankings who has had some fabulous victories over his Chinese counterparts in the past year.
ADVERTISEMENT
With Meng’s absence in the women’s singles, Chinese World No. 4 Wang Yidi will lead the charge, challenged by the Japanese duo of World No. 6 Hina Hayata and World No. 8 Kasumi Ishikawa.
The fact that the event has got so many top entries even baffled WTT organisers, who managed to put it into perspective.
“For sure, we don’t normally see this many top-20 entries for a Star Contender but we have the Singapore Smash next week, so players love the combination of first coming to Goa and then going to Singapore,” Bart Vermoesen, WTT’s event supervisor, told The Indian Express on Tuesday.
‘TT in India has grown exponentially’
India’s top-ranked player G Sathiyan has been a familiar face at top WTT tournaments over the past couple of years. The World No. 41 and Manika Batra are the top-ranked Indians at the event.
Then there’s the evergreen Sharath Kamal. The 40-year-old eight-time Commonwealth Games medallist, ranked only a few notches below Sathiyan in world rankings, is known to rise to the occasion. And what better occasion than his country hosting a premier tournament that boasts of big names for the first time since the 1987 World Championships held in New Delhi?

The men’s singles main draw also features 18-year-old Payas Jain and 21-year-old Wesley Do Rosario as wildcards. National Games champion Harmeet Desai beat Argentinian Horacio Cifuentes 3-2 in Round 3 of qualifiers to make it to the main draw.
The women’s singles main draw has Manika, the highest-ranked Indian at 34, national champion Sreeja Akula and 16-year-old Suhana Saini. Indian women did fabulously in qualifiers to dominate South Koreans to make their way into the main draw. Yashaswini Ghorpade beat Kim Nayeong 3-2 while National Games champ Sutirtha Mukherjee dominated Lee Eunhye 3-1.
The men’s doubles main draw will see Sharath and Sathiyan leading the Indian challenge along with Harmeet and Manav while Manika along with Archana Kamath will be seen in action along with the duo of Sreeja and Diya.
India’s best chance is in the mixed doubles event that will see Sathiyan and Manika pair up. The duo has been in sparkling form of late, reaching the semifinals of the Doha Contender in January.

This event will certainly see the most number of Indians at a WTT Contender event and Sathiyan cannot stop beaming about it.

Underdog Anupama Upadhyaya bounces back to beat Aakarshi Kashyap for national badminton title,Shows great maturity to beat fancied Aakarshi in three tight games for first crown.,"The loss of a grandmother she was very close to, to COVID, changed Anupama Upadhyaya completely.

Then my daadi caught COVID and passed away. It was tough to manage at home,” says the eldest child of the family of a time when responsibility overwhelmed her.
Otherwise she could quietly immerse herself in badminton for hours in Almora. When the surprise finalist and winner says “Yes, you can definitely say I’m the next Sindhu or Saina. I’m training like that,” it cannot be brushed away with a ‘yea, okay’ smile. She has played on the international circuit and knows the skill and speed deficit with the “Chinese and Japanese girls.” The ‘next’ tag isn’t to be thrown around loosely, but on the day Anupama defeated Aakarshi Kashyap 20-22, 21-17, 24-22, she earns the right to define her tag.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/underdog-anupama-upadhyay-bounces-back-to-beat-aakarshi-kashyap-for-national-badminton-title-8472058/,sports

French federation head Noel Le Graet quits amid harassment allegations,"Earlier this month, a French sports ministry audit concluded Le Graet was no longer fit to administer and represent the sport in France and ""highlighted the inappropriate behaviour of Mr Le Graet towards women"".","Noel Le Graet has resigned as president of France’s soccer federation amid allegations of harassment and sexual harassment and a government ministry audit this month that concluded the 81-year-old no longer had “the necessary legitimacy” for the job.
Le Graet, head of the French Football Federation since 2011, stepped back last month amid a legal investigation into allegations against him of sexual and moral harassment and after an audit and report commissioned by the sports ministry.
Earlier this month, a French sports ministry audit concluded Le Graet was no longer fit to administer and represent the sport in France and “highlighted the inappropriate behaviour of Mr Le Graet towards women”.
Le Graet, who presided over his last executive committee on Tuesday, has denied any wrongdoing, and the FFF has criticised the ministry’s audit as being less than objective.
Noël Le Graët a annoncé au Comité exécutif de la Fédération Française de Football sa décision de quitter ses fonctions. https://t.co/RGFUZQ8meR
— FFF (@FFF) February 28, 2023
“Noel Le Graet announced… to the Executive Committee of the French Football Federation his decision to step down from his position,” the FFF said in a statement.
The FFF said vice-president Philippe Diallo will act as interim president until June 10, the date of the next federal assembly.
Le Graet, whose mandate was due to end in 2024, had also come under fire for extending the contract of men’s coach Didier Deschamps until 2026 and for making derogatory comments aimed at France great Zinedine Zidane.
Diallo spoke highly of Le Graet after the executive committee meeting.

“It was a very important meeting for French football which began with an intervention by Mr. Le Graet, very dignified, who through the decision taken this morning, showed that once again he was one of the great leaders of French football,” he said.
The FFF also argued that the ministry’s “report (was) based less on objective facts than on assessments that have sometimes led to a disproportionate denigration of the body.
“The FFF also regrets the lack of a real adversarial procedure and the failure to take into account the many observations made by the Federation on the subjects that concern it in terms of governance and the fight against sexist and sexual violence, with figures and examples to back them up.”
French football has been in turmoil recently despite the national side reaching their fourth World Cup final in the last seven editions of the tournament, losing to Argentina in Qatar last December.

The French women’s team coach, Corinne Diacre, has also been under fire and her future may be decided on March 9 by an FFF select committee.
Team captain Wendie Renard said last week she would not play at this year’s Women’s World Cup. According to a report in French multimedia outlet RMC Sport, Renard said she would not play for the national side as long as Diacre is in charge.
Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have also said they were taking a step back from the national team.
“The executive committee had decided to entrust a small working group … with the task of examining this question in depth and to submit its conclusions to the executive committee on March 9. We will see on March 9 if we are able to take a decision. A decision will be taken quickly,” said FFF executive committee member Eric Borghini.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/french-federation-head-noel-le-graet-quits-amid-harassment-allegations-8471980/,sports
"Wrestling row: WFI appears before probe committee, denies all allegations","India lost the hosting rights of the Asian Championship after wrestlers submitted a written complaint to UWW, the world governing body of the game, about the alleged misconduct of the WFI chief.","The sidelined WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on Tuesday appeared before the government-appointed oversight committee, which is investigating into sexual abuse allegations against him, and outrightly rejected all the charges.
The Committee, led by legendary boxer MC Mary Kom, was formed on January 23 to investigate into the claims made by country’s top wrestlers that Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) boss Brij Bhushan has sexually harassed several women wrestlers, intimidates the athletes and run the sport body in an autocratic manner.
Brij Bhushan arrived with his 20-odd supporters for the meeting which went on for nearly three hours.
“Brij Bhushan appeared before the committee today. He straightaway denied all the allegations. He said he never did anything wrong,” a sports ministry source told PTI.
Brij Bhushan, however, evaded the waiting media at the SAI headquarters here, saying the investigation is still on and he won’t like to make any comment at this point of time.
The allegations were levelled by prominent grapplers such as Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya. The wrestlers have already deposed before the committee.
In January, the country’s top wrestlers had staged a three-day sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed and WFI be disbanded.

The BJP MP was later asked to step aside till the completion of the probe into his alleged misconduct.

"Sachin Tendulkar picks the spot for his statue at Wankhede, the venue where he played first and last match, won World Cup",The statue will be installed just opposite the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) lounge.,"Former Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar has picked the spot at the Wankhede Stadium where the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) is going to install his statue in the coming months. The Indian Express had previously reported on the MCA’s plans to erect a statue of Tendulkar inside the stadium premises.
Tendulkar was invited by MCA president Amol Kale on Tuesday morning to decide the place where his statue can be installed. He picked a spot just opposite the MCA lounge.
“The committee guided me, and in the area outside the MCA lounge, there will be a roundabout which will be created, and the statue will come up there. The background of it will be the stadium and all our action happened there (inside the ground). It is one spot, a crowd can come and get pictures clicked, and at the same time it is accessible,” Tendulkar said after finalising the place.
He was shown three spots, one outside the BCCI headquarters, one inside the upcoming MCA museum ground floor building, and the other outside the MCA lounge which is next to the Garware Pavilion. Tendulkar was accompanied by his wife Anjali.

“My journey started from here only, I had come to the stadium to support Shardashram (Vidyamandir) senior team. I left my match and it was then that Achrekar sir reprimanded me, the journey began from there,” the former Mumbai batsman recalled.
“Those children who used to do well in Mumbai cricket, they were kept as ball boys. I was a ball boy here too. I played Mumbai first-class cricket here and all my big moments happened at the venue. For me, the biggest moment in my life came in the 2011 World Cup and it happened on this ground. My retirement also happened here, with this ground, I have an emotional attachment towards it and I can’t compare it with anything,” he added.
Tendulkar will be turning 50 on April 24 and the MCA was planning to honour him for his service towards cricket. “It was a pleasant surprise, the president Mr (Amol) Kale is here. The idea was shared to me and I was surprised. I’m still 25 years old with 25 years of experience (laughs),” he quipped.

"David Alaba abused, Croatia coach critical following FIFA awards","“The Austrian national team vote for this award as a team, not me alone,” Alaba wrote on his social media accounts. “Everyone in the team council is able to vote and that's how it's decided.","Real Madrid defender David Alaba was racially abused on social media after voting for Lionel Messi, and Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic accused FIFA of disrespect on Tuesday in fallout from the soccer body’s annual awards ceremony.
Messi was named the best men’s player on Monday after leading Argentina to last year’s World Cup title in Qatar, with Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in third place after a standout season helping Madrid to another Champions League title.
The awards were decided by a poll of national team captains and coaches, selected media and fans voting online from candidate lists decided by FIFA-appointed expert panels.
Alaba’s vote as captain of Austria’s national team — placing Messi first, Madrid teammate Benzema second and Kylian Mbappé, the eventual runner-up, in third — was among the results published by FIFA after the ceremony in Paris.
Regarding FIFA The Best Award:
The Austrian national team vote for this award as a team, not me alone. Everyone in the team council is able to vote and that's how it's decided.
Everyone knows, especially Karim, how much I admire him and his performances
— David Alaba (@David_Alaba) February 28, 2023
That choice provoked anger from Madrid fans and others because Alaba, who is Black, voted for Messi, who spent 17 seasons at Barcelona, Real Madrid’s biggest rival.
“The Austrian national team vote for this award as a team, not me alone,” Alaba wrote on his social media accounts. “Everyone in the team council is able to vote and that’s how it’s decided.
“Everyone knows, especially Karim, how much I admire him and his performances,” added Alaba, who joined Madrid last season after more than a decade at Bayern Munich. “I have often said that for me he is the best striker in the world, and that is still the case. Without doubt.” Dalic said Tuesday he refused to vote in protest at a perceived lack of respect for himself and his team, which eliminated Brazil before losing to Argentina in the World Cup semifinals.
“I am disappointed with FIFA’s attitude towards the Croatian national team because I strongly maintain that, based on everything we’ve achieved as a national team, we deserve more respect from the head governing body of world football than we have received,” the coach said in a statement published by the Croatian soccer federation.
ADVERTISEMENT
Croatia captain Luka Modric, another Real Madrid player, was fourth in the voting. Modric won the FIFA award in 2018 when his team reached the World Cup final, losing to France.
Dalic, who placed third in 2018 in voting for the best coach award, pointed Tuesday to himself being left off the five-man shortlist this time, and for his players being overlooked for other awards, including a player-voted all-star team.
“Was there really no place for Mateo Kovacic on that list, even though he’s won the FIFA Club World Cup (with Chelsea) and played a brilliant World Cup in Qatar? Where is Joško Gvardiol’s name?” Dalic asked. “And did Dominik Livakovic not deserve to be one of the five finalists for the Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper after everything he did in Qatar?” Dalic also noted that Morocco coach Walid Regragui was a candidate — finishing fourth for the coaching award won by Argentina’s Lionel Scaloni — despite Croatia beating that team in the third-place game at the World Cup and drawing in their group match in Qatar.
“Having taken all of the above into consideration, I have decided not to partake in the voting process for this year’s awards,” Dalic said, aiming a further barb at FIFA. “Both the time slots of our matches at the World Cup and the quality of refereeing — especially at the semifinal match — made me feel that there was a lack of respect towards the Croatian team.” FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/david-alaba-abused-croatia-coach-critical-following-fifa-awards-8471757/,sports
Over Rs 9 crore: That’s what Ronaldo’s four-and-half-hours cost a Saudi company,"The Saudi-based company would get four-and-a-half hours with Ronaldo, comprising a photo-shoot, five signed shirts and two plugs across his social media channels.","Before joining Saudi club Al Nassr for an eyewatering £173 million-a-year deal, Cristiano Ronaldo had cost a Saudi Arabia company around £920,000 (INR 91,951,122) back in 2017 for four and a half hours of his time.
This is according to Der Spiegel journalists Rafael Buschmann and Michael Wulzinger’s book Football Leaks which uncovered how much it cost to hire one of the biggest names in the world, let alone football.
According to the book, a Saudi telecoms business Mobily had struck a deal with Ronaldo’s Irish image rights company, Multisports and Image Management. The Saudi-based company would get four-and-a-half hours with Ronaldo, comprising a photo-shoot, five signed shirts and two plugs across his social media channels, where he reportedly earns around £1.6 million (INR 15,98,13,552) per sponsored post.
For all of these, Ronaldo and his representatives charged the company an a whopping amount of £920,000. The company was allowed to use the photos taken on the day but as it was a regional company, the advertisements were limited to the Middle East and North African countries.
Meanwhile, Ronaldo on Saturday netted an incredible first-half hat trick for his side Al Nassr against Damac FC.
After just 18 minutes into the game, Ronaldo gave his team the lead with a goal from the penalty spot after Ibrahim Al Nakhli had been penalised for a handball inside the penalty area.
With a brilliantly executed left-footed drive into the goal, Ronaldo doubled his tally and gave his team a 2-0 lead within the next five minutes.

With that goal, Ronaldo has now scored 153 goals with his weak foot. In his last four games, he has scored seven goals and registered two assists.

You could hear the graze of stud marks on earth as Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill strolled into the nets, the firm thud off the bat on the turf, the excited whisper of the net bowlers, restlessly tossing the ball in their hands to display their craft against two of the finest batsmen around, two most graceful stroke-makers in the world. The net bowlers, mostly in their late teens spotting scraggly stubbles, converged beside the nets where Sharma was batting.

"India may simulate English conditions in Ahmedabad Test to prepare for WTC Final, hints captain Rohit Sharma","The 2021/23 WTC cycle final will be played at The Oval in London from June 7-11, and it looks likely that India square up against Australia in the same.","Having already retained the 2023 Border Gavaskar Trophy, India lead 2-0 in the four Test series against Australia and walk into the third in Indore as firm favorites.
With that taken into account, it is a ‘possibility’ per Indian captain Rohit Sharma that the hosts try to simulate English conditions in Ahmedabad to prepare for the upcoming World Test Championship final, if they wrap up the series in Indore.

‘He’s due for a big one’: Brett Lee predicts a hundred from Steve Smith in 3rd IND vs AUS Test,"IND vs AUS: In absence of Pat Cummins, Steve Smith will lead the side in the third Test at Indore.","Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee said he is hopeful of big innings from Steve Smith and predicted a 100 will come in the third or the fourth Test. “B good opportunity to speak about Stephen Smith. He is a standout batsman in the first Test in Nagpur. He was probably the one that looked the most determined and I guess gritty to get through the hard overs.”
Talking about the kind of form Smith has come off, Lee said, “I’m expecting a big one from Steven Smith, maybe 100 in this next Test, or the one after because I think that he’s coming off some really, really good form. He found his feet a little bit in the first Test match even though he didn’t get any big scores. But once again, I actually believe he’s due for a big one.”
In terms of their squad composition, a lot has changed with Pat Cummins back in Australia to be with his ailing mother. Ashton Agar, Josh Hazlewood and David Warner too are back home. Steve Smith will lead the side. The visitors could not be faulted for the amount of effort they are putting in to stage a comeback in the series.
Smith scored 37 and 25 in Nagpur Test, while in Delhi he got out for a duck and 9 in the second innings. Adding further to his prediction, Lee also said,” So hopefully for Australia, they pay off the positive momentum that Steve Smith brings to the team. As I mentioned, coming off a bit of a purple patch back in Australia, fresh off the BBL with a wonderful series, and just the way he’s looking at the nets but also to the way he is looked at the middle in very tough conditions. Watch out for Steven Smith. He’s due for a big one hopefully for Australia.”

IND vs AUS: Stripping vice captaincy does not mean anything big- Rohit Sharma on KL Rahul ahead of 3rd Test,India and Australia to face each other in the third Test in Indore starting from Wednesday.,"IND vs AUS: Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has opened up on under-fire KL Rahul’s place in the Playing XI for the third Test against Australia in Indore. Addressing the media in the pre-match conference, Rohit said, “All 17 players in the team has a chance. The team will back those who are talented. Stripping vice-captaincy does not mean anything big. He was made the vice captain because maybe there was not many experienced players at that time. It is not a big thing.”

India have already secured the Border-Gavaskar trophy and they will now be playing for a record-extending 16th straight series win at home and a guaranteed spot in the World Test Championship final in June.
Leading 2-0 in a four-match series, India are sitting pretty and just need to make one tough decision of choosing between out-of-form K L Rahul and Shubman Gill. Rahul is no more the vice-captain of the side but the team management has shown tremendous faith in him and he might well get another opportunity to get back among the runs.
Rahul averages an underwhelming 33.4 after 47 Tests while Gill has been waiting patiently for his opportunity in red-ball cricket after a sensational season in limited overs cricket. Rahul, who has failed to cross the 25-run mark in his last 10 Test innings, was removed as vice-captain following the second Test in Delhi, raising hopes of a change for the remaining two games.

When asked the preparation of both Gill and Rahul, the skipper added: “As far as Gill and KL Rahul are concerned, that is how they train before any game. Today was optional training session for the entire group. Whoever wanted to come they came.
“As far as 11 is concerned, I would like to do it at the toss. I prefer it that way considering last minute injuries are a possibility.” India lead the four-match series 2-0 and a win here will guarantee them a place in the World Test Championship final in June.

Irani Cup: Chance for Mayank to remain relevant,"Though the Irani Cup has lost much of its significance in the last 15 years as most national players are always on the move, the tournament, at an individual level, is important for Agarwal, especially in the backdrop of KL Rahul's dipping form.","The Irani Cup could rekindle Rest of India skipper Mayank Agarwal’s hopes of returning to the national setup when his side takes on 2021-22 Ranji Trophy champions Madhya Pradesh in the season-ending domestic tournament beginning here Wednesday.
Though the Irani Cup has lost much of its significance in the last 15 years as most national players are always on the move, the tournament, at an individual level, is important for Agarwal, especially in the backdrop of KL Rahul’s dipping form.
Agarwal, a stylish opener, was dropped from the India team last year after a poor series in South Africa.
However, with Rahul enduring a poor run of form and Agarwal ending the Ranji season at the top of the scoring charts with 990 runs, he could return to the national fold at some stage during the year.
While the squad for the last two Tests against Australia has been selected, another good performance from Agarwal in the season-ending first-class tournament could make him a potential replacement for Rahul for the World Test Championship final in London if India qualify.
He could also be seriously considered for the tour of West Indies.
In the context of the Irani Cup match, Rest of India remain firm favourites against a depleted Madhya Pradesh in the absence of their top batter Rajat Patidar and regular captain Aditya Srivastava.
ADVERTISEMENT
But the likes of pacer Avesh Khan, all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer, left-arm spinner Kumar Kartikeya and batter Yash Dubey are no pushovers in the Madhya Pradesh side.
If Agarwal and his likely opening partner Abhimanyu Easwaran are the two men on the national selectors’ radar, there is another aspect that will be closely monitored by Shiv Sunder Das and Co — the next generation of spin bowlers.
Ravichandran Ashwin is 36 and Ravindra Jadeja 34. Both are still going strong in Indian conditions with the latter having a like-for-like cover in Axar Patel.
However, a look at India’s next generation of spin-bowling resources paints a grim picture.
ADVERTISEMENT
There is no clear off-break successor to Ashwin. Since Amit Mishra last played for India, there haven’t been any wrist spinners who have come close to Test team selection.
Pulkit Narang, an off-spinner discarded by the Delhi Ranji team a few years back, has got into the ROI squad on the back of nearly 30 scalps this season. A student of Virat Kohli’s childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma, Narang, despite his limited range of skills, has been an India nets regular during the series against Australia.
Ashwin’s cover for the longest time, Haryana’s Jayant Yadav, hasn’t done anything of note in the past few seasons to be considered.
Among left-arm options, India A regular Saurabh Kumar has stayed in the mix, while Rahul Chahar’s injuries and paucity of options have led to leg-spinner Mayank Markande’s selection in the ROI side.
ADVERTISEMENT
Among pacers, Mukesh Kumar and a fit-again Navdeep Saini will keep the selectors interested along with the under-rated wicketkeeper-batter Upendra Yadav, who many consider better than Kona Bharat.
This year’s Irani Cup is unique in the sense that the pending match — between Rest of India and 2019-20 Ranji champions Saurashtra — was played at the start of the season, while the game between ROI and 2021-22 Ranji champions Madhya Pradesh is being played as a domestic season finale.
This was necessitated due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the tournament could not be held during the 2020-21 season.
Irani Cup used to be a premier domestic tournament till the early part of 2000 and was considered a trial game for pathway into the national squad.

However, after the concept of regular India A shadow tours became the norm, Rest of India’s one-off game doesn’t mean much in the context of senior team selections.

IND vs AUS: Steve Smith says Australia batsmen will ditch ‘risky tempo’ in third Test,"Australia's hopes of reclaiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy have been extinguished following back-to-back defeats in Nagpur and New Delhi, with the touring batsmen struggling to score on spin-friendly wickets.","Australia’s stand-in skipper Steve Smith said their batsmen will aim to slow things down at the crease when they take on India in the third test in Indore starting on Wednesday after risky shot-making cost them dearly in the previous match.
Australia’s hopes of reclaiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy have been extinguished following back-to-back defeats in Nagpur and New Delhi, with the touring batsmen struggling to score on spin-friendly wickets.
Smith was among those who played reckless sweep shots in their second innings in the Indian capital only to fall lbw or be bowled by spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who have taken 31 wickets between them in two matches.
Australia went on to lose that match by six wickets for their second consecutive defeat inside three days.
“I was pretty angry,” Smith said of his dismissal which sparked Australia’s collapse as they lost eight wickets for 28 runs. “There haven’t been too many times in my 94-test career where I’ve come off and been bedazzled by what I’ve done.
“It wasn’t the way I wanted to play. We probably rushed things a little bit and it’s something we’ll talk about. When we’ve got them on the ropes we can slow things down.
“We don’t have to play at such a high tempo and risky tempo. We had them where we wanted them, we had men out and the ability to get off strike.”

Smith, who is filling in for Pat Cummins after the skipper left to be with his ailing mother back home, said that Australia would have another look at the Holkar Stadium wicket before deciding on their playing side.

Gutsy bouncer-happy Neil Wagner wins a thriller for New Zealand against England,The story of how the 1998 Donald vs Atherton epic battle gave Wagner the goosebumps and inspired him to be fast bowler who hurls bouncers,"Watching Neil Wagner bowl is one of the most visceral cricket experiences out there. He spews his guts out, drags us with him into the heat of the battle, make us feel his pain, his effort, his ceaseless energy, his undying passion- it can all get a bit gut-wrenching at times. No other pacer hurls as many bouncers as him. No one is as accurate as him. It all began with Allan Donald.
Neil Wagner was 12 and living in motherland South Africa when he saw one of the greatest duels between a fast bowler and a batsman: Allan Donald vs Mike Atherton, 1998. Balls of fire vs courage. “There were a lot of stares and glares in the middle of the wicket, and I remember getting absolute goose bumps,” years later Wagner would tell New Zealand Herald, nailing that moment of falling in love with pacy bouncers. He carried drinks for couple of South Africa’s Tests but with competition escalating, he switched to New Zealand.
And it was a game against Sri Lanka in 2016 when Neil Wagner became the bouncer-happy Wagner that the cricketing world watches in awe these days. In the words of Australian Matthew Wade, who was once peppered by a Wagner barrage in Perth, “If you looked at all the bouncers he bowled … he’s always between your shoulder and the top of your peak, or in your armpits. I don’t think anyone in the game has bowled bouncers the way he bowled and been so consistent, and not gotten scored off while also picking up wickets. I’ve never faced a bowler who is so accurate at bowling bouncers.”
WHAT A GAME OF CRICKET
New Zealand have won it by the barest of margins…
This is test cricket at its finest ❤️

— Cricket on BT Sport (@btsportcricket) February 28, 2023
In that game against Sri Lanka at Dunedin, urged by his team-mate Tom Latham, Wagner went for an all-bouncer attack. “It was a 10-over spell, and I just bowled bouncers. People like [Black Caps opener] Tom Latham had often suggested I play to my strength and concentrate on the bouncers. But it was the first time it really fell into place.It got to the point where I had set Mathews up, and Tim Southee came up and said don’t be shy of aiming a yorker at leg stump. I bowled a perfect one. It was an extremely special moment, a team-oriented effort, after a discussion that went around the players. It made me feel part of something bigger.”
And yet things had threatened to go pear-shaped in the second Test against England in the current series. Harry Brook repeatedly backed away from the stumps to thump him all over the park as he bled 101 runs from his 17 overs on the opening day’s play. The game hurtled towards the final day and came in the hands of Wagner, who is a bit of a fourth-innings specialist. When most pacers are running out of gas, Wagner, incredibly, manages to dig deep to fine undying fire.
England were resuscitated from the depths of 80 for 5 by Joe Root and Ben Stokes and reached 201 for 5, needing just 57 more when Tim Southee brought on Wagner. For one last dice roll, for one one final blast. Until then, Stokes, who was battling a dodgy knee, had gone anti-Bazball, dropping anchor to reach 33 from 116 balls.
Off his third ball, Wagner went round the stumps at Stokes and fired a short ball; Stokes swayed away. Next ball came another bouncer and this time Stokes decided to go for it. He backed away and flung his bat at it, but the bottom-hand slipped out, and he skied a catch.
“It’s about summing up the conditions. There is a period of where you go at him, take risks, and see if you can do this (bouncing at Stokes) – and buy a wicket . They needed runs, they also know they can get out,” Wagner would say later. “When you get wickets, it makes hard for the next guy to start. It’s about summing up the conditions in the moment of the game.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The conditions to be summed up was this: a fifth-day pitch without venom, just 50-odd runs needed, and two set batsmen in. And Wagner stirred.
But Root was still in, and on 95 no less. He knew what was coming from Wagner and so of the first ball next over, he retreated back in the crease and had a higher bat lift. But this Wagner bouncer doesn’t bounce as high and Root’s intended pull goes awry, ballooning up to the man at midwicket. 202 for 7, and Wagner’s New Zealand get ahead.
But Ben Foakes played a superb hand to show why England prefer him over Jos Buttler in Tests. Wondrous behind the stumps, and increasingly nerveless in front of it, these days. But with just seven runs left, Southee’s bouncer induces an out-of-control pull from Foakes, and the ball flies to fine-leg where who else but Wagner stood. “Tim [southee] always gives me stick for not taking catches in my career! He was very happy that I added a couple to tally. It’s a moment you live for; these pressure situations. Put up your hand – I take pride and passion.” And he swallows it.
But with 6 left, when James Anderson crashed a four, even Wagner felt it was over. “I was going for his gloves and last thing I expected him was backing away and getting a big hit at it. And going between Williamson’s legs is not something you see. Especially in the over prior, one edge flew over Blundell (the wicketkeeper). You start thinking, whether that’s it, is this the game?”
ADVERTISEMENT
Luckily, he refocussed and had one final dart at Anderson with just 2 needed. “Too much went through my head. Gosh! All the things that go at top of mark. What ball to bowl, they needed 2 runs. Should I pitch it and be at his stumps. You just stick to your guns. Keep thinking about getting that glove or catches in play. It just came off.”
There is also a moment when he was very young at backyard cricket in South Africa that probably decided the course of his career for him. An older brother bounced a tennis-ball, wrapped by insulation tape, at him at high pace, right on his ear. He was told not to cry and complain, but harden up. “We played a lot of back yard cricket, and what was supposed to be touch rugby which always ended up with contact. I wouldn’t say I was bullied, but I had to fight for things,” he told NZ Herald.
When he was 13, his parents lost their jobs in real estate business. They lost their home. It took five years for their parents to reestablish themselves, with catering and gardening business. Neil’s resolve to make something of his life grew.

IND vs AUS: Michael Kasprowicz wants Australia to prioritise seam ahead of spin in Indore Test,"With skipper Pat Cummins and batter David Warner ruled out of the contest, the tourists are likely to welcome back Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green.","Former Australian fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz has come up with different advice to the struggling Aussies ahead of the third Test in the Border Gavaskar Trophy starting from Wednesday in Indore.
Expecting Cameron Green and Mitchell Starc’s return to the playing XI, Kasprowicz said on SENQ Breakfast, “Coming up to this Test match with the line-up, Cameron Green is going to be picked. You’ll have Starc in for Cummins for other reasons he (Cummins) can’t be there. Green will come into the middle order, he may come in for Warner with the changes there.”
Starc suffered the injury to the middle finger of his bowling hand and was sidelined as Australia lost the opening two tests of the four-match series against India.
With skipper Pat Cummins and batter David Warner ruled out of the contest, the tourists are likely to welcome back Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green.
With Starc and Green almost certainties to play, Kasprowicz has called for Scott Boland to also join the XI as he hopes selectors go away from playing all three of Nathan Lyon, Todd Murphy and Matt Kuhnemann.

"A couple of holes in my shoes with few legs sticking in, says Neil Wagner about team huddle after New Zealand beat England by 1 run","Left-arm fast bowler took four crucial wickets - Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, and last man James Anderson just when the second Test seemed to be slipping away from New Zealand's grasp","NZ vs ENG: As the delirious with joy New Zealand players ran and jumped over each other before forming a huddle to celebrate the famous one-run win over England in Wellington, fast bowler Neil Wagner was the hero of the moment. Four wickets, including that of Ollie Pope, Ben Stokes, Joe Root and last man James Anderson, were priceless and he was also quick on the field taking two smart catches.
“Someone’s nail fish-hook in my face… a couple of holes in my shoes with few legs sticking in … these are the moments that stay with life forever – not 5 wickets or whatever,” Wagner said when asked about the celebrations within the huddle.
New Zealand, after being made to follow-on, had posted 483 and gave England a 258-run target.
For all his effort with the ball, Wagner came very close to handing England the win.

In what was to be the second last ball of the second Test, left-arm quick Wagner bowled short down the leg-side to last man James Anderson. England, riding high on their Bazball philosophy, needed two to win at that point. If the ball had been called a ‘wide’ the scores would have been tied. But it was not to be and the second Test at Wellington hung in the balance.
Four overs earlier it was Wagner who took a tumbling catch at fine leg to dismiss the last recognised batsman Ben Foakes who had skied his pull shot to Tim Southee. But Anderson and Jack Leach had survived and England were just a couple of runs away from sweeping the two match series 0-2. Anderson had even swung to find a four in Wagner’s previous over.
But Wagner would have the last laugh. His hard lengths and deceptively good short balls are always a handful. Here he was really steaming in and bending his back to get the ball to rise. The ball to dismiss Anderson wasn’t the best though. Short and once again more leg-side, the England fast bowler could have let it go. But Anderson’s feeble attempt to play it to fine leg as the ball was rising towards his hips ended up in the hands of diving wicketkeeper Tom Blundell. A little more bat on it and the ball would have headed to the boundary. But New Zealand had pulled off a famous win; the first time a team following on had won a Test since India’s famous win over Australia at Eden Gardens.

“Too much went through my head. Gosh! All the things that go at the top of the mark. What ball to bowl, they needed 2 runs. Should I pitch it and be at his stumps? You just stick to your guns. Keep thinking about getting that glove or catches in play. It just came off. Great character from the team to keep fighting,” Wagner said after pulling off the tense win.

It was Wagner who also struck major blows during England’s run chase when he dismissed the well-set Joe Root for 95 after getting rid of England captain Ben Stokes. Root was surprised by the rising trajectory of the ball and was caught at mid-wicket, Stokes tried to dispatch Wagner to the boundary but was caught too.
“It’s about summing up the conditions . There is a period where you go at him, take risks, and see if you can do this (bouncing at Stokes) – and buy a wicket. They needed runs, they also know they can get out. When you get wickets, it makes it hard for the next guy to start. It’s about summing up the conditions,” Wagner said about dismissing Stokes and Root in successive overs. Stokes and Root had added 121 runs for the sixth wicket and till they were at the crease, England looked in control.
When Anderson had hit a welcome boundary off Wagner in the 73rd over with England needing just six to win, it looked like this could be another win for the Bazball brand of cricket. Wagner said he felt the game had slipped away at that point.
“I thought that was the game. I was going for his gloves and the last thing I expected him to do was backing away and getting a big hit at it. And going between Williamson’s legs is not something you see. Especially in the over prior, one edge flew over Blundell (the wicketkeeper). You start thinking, whether that’s it, is this the game?.”

Kane Williamson who made a back against the ball century when they were following on called it a ‘fantastic game’.
“Doesn’t quite feel right to be standing here, after a game of cricket like that and the contributions we’ve seen from both teams throughout. A fantastic game of cricket to be a part of and, for us as a team, we’ve been fighting away in the test format for a while so it’s nice to get across the line on this one. This England team is playing incredible cricket at the moment and we’re up against it, coming into this game. So to fight away and compete and ultimately just get across the line is a really nice feeling,” Williamson said.

England skipper Stokes said that he and Root should have taken the team home.
“That game is what Test cricket is about, the emotions we were going through and the Kiwi boys as well. Everyone’s got their money’s worth today. We knew that at some point Tim would have to roll the dice. For Joe and myself, that was the opportunity to pounce, and sometimes things don’t happen how you want them to. With bouncer plans, you have to make a decision about what to go to. As soon as Waggie came on I saw it as an opportunity to take 20 runs.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/nz-vs-eng-neil-wagner-about-team-huddle-after-new-zealand-beat-england-by-1-run-8470536/,sports

“It was a case of assessing the situations, we always knew that at some point in that partnership (between himself and Root), Tim was gonna have to roll the dice with something. Wags came on and blew the game open for them. For myself and Joe there, that was our opportunity to pounce,” he added.

About attacking the short-balls from the Kiwi bowlers, Stokes said, “Sometimes things don’t happen the way you want them to. With those bouncer plans, we had to make a decision and obviously, it didn’t come off for us. It was an opportunity for us to score runs there. As soon as Waggie came on to do those bouncers, I saw it as an opportunity to maybe take 20 runs off the over and then bring the game even more in our favour.
“Credit to Waggie and Tim for coming up with that idea. (On his knee) Better than bad. Disappointing to end with a loss here. We had a great summer last year. We have a few months off before the Ashes. We will look to do what we can,” he added.
New Zealand completed a dramatic fightback on the last day to beat England by one run Tuesday and become only the fourth team in history to win a cricket Test after being forced to follow-on. On a day of constant twists and turns, Joe Root scored 95 in a partnership of 121 with Ben Stokes (33) which appeared to have batted England to victory and a 2-0 win in the two-test series.

The character shown by the guys has been very special. Try to stay as calm. Just give it your best shot. Great Test to be involved in.”
Speaking about the first Test which New Zealand lost by 267 runs he said, “We couldn’t read much into the Day-Night Test. England were all class in the first two days”

Praising the performances of his players Southee said “Number of guys to thank. The openers held it together in the second innings. Then Kane and Blundell. Neil has been doing this for a long period of time. It came off for him at the right time. Great for Test cricket for all the guys that are here. Having Test matches like these is good for Tests going forward.”

"Coming soon at Wankhede, a life-size Sachin Tendulkar statue",Sachin Tendulkar statue: Mumbai cricket officials are hoping that it will be unveiled during the 50-over World Cup in October-November,"Sachin Tendulkar statue: Ten years after he retired from cricket, a life-size statue of Sachin Tendulkar will be installed inside the iconic Wankhede stadium in Mumbai where he played his final game for India. Cricket officials are hoping the statue will be unveiled during the 50-over World Cup later this year.
“It will be the first statue in Wankhede Stadium, we will decide where it will be placed,” Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president Amol Kale told The Indian Express.
“He (Tendulkar) is a Bharat Ratna and everyone knows what he has done for cricket. As he turns 50, it will be a small token of appreciation from the MCA. I spoke to him three weeks ago and his consent was received,” Kale said.
Sachin Tendulkar retired from international cricket after playing his final and 200th Test against the West Indies.
Tendulkar has a stand named after him at the Wankhede. A season ago, the MCA decided to honour the former India captain Sunil Gavaskar with a corporate box and batting ace Dilip Vengsarkar with a stand.
There are not many life-size statues of cricketers inside stadiums in the country. There are three separate such statues of the former big-hitting India great C K Nayudu at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, VDCA Stadium in Andhra and and Holkar Stadium in Indore.

The pitch in Indore has a red soil coating at the top and black soil underneath to hold everything together. It is similar to the present-day wicket at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and puts the Australian batsmen under scrutiny against Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.

"After marathon win to qualify for Asian Games, army man Man Singh’s long, arduous trek to reach home in the hills","Tired of losing at 5000 and 10,000 metres races, Singh turned to marathon and has now clocked the third-fastest time by an Indian.","A day after winning his first-ever marathon at the age of 33, Man Singh travelled seven hours in a state transport bus to Pithoragarh. He then took a shared-taxi to Lumti, where his sister resides, to break the journey. To get home to Kumariyagair village in Bangapani tehsil, Singh has to trek uphill with a heavy army backpack on his shoulders. “It will take me almost three hours to cover the 10 kilometres. Most of it is through a forest area. Almost as tough as running a marathon,” Singh jested.
The backpack will be a little heavier too as Singh is carrying sweets to celebrate his New Delhi Marathon win. “In our village, the first choice of career for men is the Indian army. There are many others who are in the army. But I am the first national-level athlete and first marathon runner from Kumariyagair,” Singh, a naib subedar, said.
On Sunday, Singh led a trio of army runners in a 1-2-3 finish in the New Delhi marathon. All three ran faster than the Asian Games qualifying norm of the Athletics Federation of India (2:15:00). Singh clocked 2 hours, 14 minutes and 13 seconds with Appachangada Belliappa (2:14.15) snapping at his heels. Karthik Kumar’s 2:14.19 for third place made this one of the fastest marathons by Indian runners. Singh is now the third fastest-ever, after Shivnath Singh’s four-decade old national record of 2:12.00 and Olympian Thanackal Gopi’s 2:13:39.
Sunday was a special day for Singh because it was only his second gold medal in distance running events at a national-level event in seven years. Singh is a 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres specialist who ran in the shadow of Govindan Lakshmanan, the winner of the double gold at the 2017 Asian Championships.
“I won the gold in the 5,000 metres at the South Asian Games in 2016. That was my last major gold. But at the South Asian Games Lakshmanan didn’t participate in the event. I also had to compete against Gopi. Most of the time I was second or third in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres,” Singh said.
Last year, Singh decided to do something different in his quest to leave behind years of disappointment of being outclassed in races. His training group at the Army Sports Institute in Pune comprised seasoned marathoners like Olympians Nitender Singh Rawat, Gopi and Kheta Ram. Six years ago at the Mumbai Marathon he was one of the pace-setters till 30 kilometres. Back then a thought entered his mind: ‘If I am comfortable running 30 kilometers why not try 42.1 kilometres’.
It took a while for Singh to run his first marathon but the results have been encouraging. Last month at the Mumbai Marathon, his debut marathon, he finished second in the Elite Indian men’s category clocking (2:16.58).

“I have been preparing for the marathon for a few months. I was not able to crack the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres in terms of qualifying for big events. The second-place finish in Mumbai gave me confidence that I could do well in the marathon. When I came to Delhi, the weather was ideal for running a marathon. I had a feeling I could meet the qualifying norm for the Asian Games,” Singh said.
Singh had a sleepless night before the Mumbai Marathon. His biggest worry was whether he would be able to complete the distance of 42.195 kilometres. “What if I start to tire after 35-36 kilometres and quit? The other marathon runners had told me how they sort of hit a wall after 35 to 36 kilometres and then it is about mental strength. But I didn’t give up,” Singh, who finished second to Gopi, said.
The last two kilometres in New Delhi too was a challenge for Singh. He started to slow down and both Belliappa and Kumar fancied their chances. “Belliappa and I were neck to neck. I had to dip at the finish to edge him out.”
From hoping to finish on the podium at national events to a medal at this year’s Asian Games – the scale of Singh’s dreams have grown over the past few months. “Now, I have the belief that I can compete with the best in India and Asia in the marathon. I wanted to be the best in the 5,000m and the 10,000m. That didn’t happen. So maybe the marathon is the event in which I can fulfil my potential.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Singh started running long distances to get physically fit and get selected for army trials, which youngsters in his village aspire for. Before returning home for a short break as an army man-athlete set to compete in the Asian Games, Singh had a lucky break.
The call to his farmer-parents, Sher Singh and mother Muneri Devi connected. “There could be a phone signal for only a few minutes during a day in Kumariyagair. It is a really remote place, so to talk to the outside world over the phone is at times a small luxury.”

If red soil pitches are mostly dominant in the south, black soil is the preferred one in the north. While bounce can be a factor in the west, in eastern parts the low surfaces can challenge batsmen. Here we explain the different types of pitches.
Red soil
A staple at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, M Chinnaswamy, and at the Wankhede. Once the wear and tear starts happening and if the Test lasts all five days it will end up more like a Roland Garros surface with plenty of rough patches around the fuller-length area. The red soil pitches usually have a lot of bounce and spinners like bowling in it as they are always in the game. That said, if not watered enough, the red soil pitches are the ones which tend to crumble fast, making survival all the more challenging for batsmen.
Black soil
Feroz Shah Kotla, Mohali, and Eden Gardens have black soil pitches, where the bounce is low. Thanks to the clay, when watered, it tends to hold the surface together for long and batsmen usually tend to make merry in such conditions. To even the contest out, curators often leave a bit of live grass or stop watering it a couple of days before a Test so that spinners get some turn out of it. These pitches can even give way to invariable bounce. Batting often tends to become easy in the second session on such pitches and when the ball gets old. Also black soil pitches can act differently at different parts. For example in Bangladesh, the black soil pitches are slower than the one in India because of the low water content.

What is in store in Indore?
Here is where it gets interesting. Curators tend to be imaginative and often treat the square akin to how a farmer treats his agricultural field. Only they know what sort of ingredients are mixed and what it will offer during the course of the Test. It is a secret recipe even hosting teams can find hard to crack and on Monday there were mixed feelings as to what sort of pitch was on offer. Some citing the red patches on the pitch said it is a red soil pitch. Others who had the fortune of looking at the pitch said it is black. And what is in store is a mixture of red and black soil.

What does that mean? Is it routine?
It is routine. It is not any doctoring or tailor-made one prepared to suit India. The groundstaff have preferred a mixture of both because with summer setting in, they believe the black soil will hold the pitch together for a longer period. There were reports that suggested that the pitch was watered on Monday, which means it won’t crumble as quickly as red-soil pitch.

“Look, it doesn’t matter if it is red soil, black soil or violet soil. What makes a pitch is the mixture of all these ingredients. If we feel that the red soil, with exposure to sun, can break quickly and needs something to keep it intact, then black soil will be able to provide it.
“And in such cases, there will be bounce as long as the top layer (in Indore the top layer is red soil) is intact and once that is gone, the wear and tear will start,” a curator familiar with the development told The Indian Express.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/red-soil-black-soil-pitch-indore-wicket-for-third-test-between-india-and-australia-8470016/,sports
"Paul Pogba is back in Juve squad, Massimiliano Allegri says",The France international had an operation on a damaged meniscus in September and also missed the World Cup in Qatar with the national team.,"Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba could make his long awaited return to the pitch in the Serie A clash against Torino on Tuesday after recovering from a number of injuries, manager Massimiliano Allegri said on Monday.
The France international had an operation on a damaged meniscus in September and also missed the World Cup in Qatar with the national team.
The only time Pogba has been part of the squad this season was as an unused substitute in the 2-0 loss against Monza on Jan. 29.
“Pogba will be called up for the derby and will play if necessary. He doesn’t have much playing time in his legs, but more than enough,” Allegri told reporters.
“I have spoken to him as I have done with the other players. He must understand that we’re at an important stage of the season. He must have the drive to have given his contribution at the end of the season.”
Allegri added that forward Federico Chiesa, who has been on and off with injuries this season, is also back in regular training after missing recent games.
“Yesterday, Chiesa trained with the team after six so-so days. Now to say that Pogba can be a starter after 315 days on the sidelines or likewise, Chiesa, who has been out for 10 months, is another thing. A little patience is needed,” Allegri said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“(Leonardo) Bonucci is fine, but due to his long period of inactivity, he’ll be sitting close to me at kick-off tomorrow evening. But having him back is already an important plus, he is the club captain after all.”
Allegri’s side are eighth in the standings on 32 points, one above city rivals Torino ahead of the home clash, and will aim to expand their winning streak to four league matches.
“Torino are a team moulded by coach (Ivan) Juric, teams that have a very specific playing system. They attack a lot, they pile on a lot of pressure. These matches are very intense but we’ve done well at immersing ourselves in these kinds of challenges. If we think we can play on our tiptoes, we’re done for,” Allegri said.
Juve were deducted 15 points for the current season by an Italian soccer court investigating the club’s transfer dealings in January. Still, Allegri said that the season’s main goal has not changed.
“Regardless of what happens off the pitch, we have earned 47 points and we must try and stay in the top four, one of our aims at the start of the season,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/paul-pogba-is-back-in-juve-squad-massimiliano-allegri-says-8470010/,sports

"IND vs AUS: Aussies relying too much on Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschange, says Glenn McGrath",The Australia team has come in for criticism from former players over various issues including their approach and selection.,"The legendary Glenn McGrath on Monday said the Australian team is relying too much on Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschange in the ongoing four-match Test series in India and there is a need for the whole batting line-up to stand up.
Australia have already conceded the Border-Gavaskar trophy after suffering heavy defeats in the first two Tests.
“I think they’re relying too much on (Steve) Smith and Marnus (Labuschagne) at the moment. Travis Head has had a really good year as well. The whole batting line-up has to stand up,” McGrath, who is director of coaching at MRF Pace Foundation, told reporters here.
The Australia team has come in for criticism from former players over various issues including their approach and selection.
Speaking about the Australian team’s performance, the 53-year-old McGrath said, “I think they haven’t settled on a game plan on how to play spin in India that they are confident with and can execute.
“In the first Test, they were too defensive, and in the second Test, they were too aggressive. So we will see if they’ve learned from those two matches.
“They have to find a happy medium and put a price on their wicket. In India, you have to build an innings on solid defence and then look at ways to score and put the pressure back on the bowlers,” he added.

McGrath further said the absence of pacers Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green had affected the team balance but, at the same time, also questioned selection decisions, like the omission of Head for the first Test in Nagpur.
“They haven’t been able to come and clean up the tail. The last three batters have put on 160-plus. They are the ones causing problems. Whether they got the bowling changes right? Maybe Pat Cummins could have come in earlier.
“Little bit of reverse swing try to pick early wickets at the death there. Give credit to Indian players (Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin and Axar Patel). They know how to play on these pitches. They are spin bowlers. They know what opposition is trying to do,” the Aussie pace legend said, giving credit to the way the Indians have played in Nagpur and Delhi.
Looking ahead to the next two Tests, McGrath said, “Australia has a long way to turn things around. If they leave the shores with the scoreline not being 4-0, I think they would have done well.” He had words of praise for the Australian women’s team which won the T20 World Cup in South Africa on Sunday and said “they are a quality team and they’ve been a quality team for a long, long time.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-border-gavaskar-trophy-glenn-mcgrath-on-steve-smith-and-marnus-labuschange-8469994/,sports

"Journalists, police clash at Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan’s Lahore city",Video clips showed police officials and the journalists engaged in heated arguments after the police surrounded them and asked them to surrender their masks before entering the stadium.,"Chaos descended upon the Gaddafi Stadium, which was hosting a PSL cricket match, after a group of journalists were denied entry to the venue by police officials for wearing masks in solidarity with the slain journalist Arshad Sharif.
Sharif, 49, a former reporter and TV anchor with ARY TV, was shot dead in Nairobi on October 23 last year under mysterious circumstances, sending shockwaves across Pakistan.
On Sunday, television anchor Imran Riaz and his friends donning masks with the picture of Sharif were stopped by police from entering the Gaddafi Stadium, the venue of a PSL-8 match, despite having tickets.
The situation quickly escalated after Riaz and his friends began to chant slogans to show their solidarity with Sharif.
Video clips showed police officials and the journalists engaged in heated arguments after the police surrounded them and asked them to surrender their masks before entering the stadium.
In the video, a police inspector was seen shouting to the journalists that wearing the mask showing the ‘face’ of Sharif on the premises of the stadium was a clear violation of the regulations of the Pakistan Cricket Board.
Soon, a scuffle broke out between the police officials and the journalists.

“By wearing Arshad Sharif’s masks, we wanted to show solidarity with him and his family and seek justice for him,” Riaz was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.
In August last year, Sharif was booked on charges of sedition for interviewing former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s close aide Shehbaz Gill.
In the interview, Gill criticised the Shehbaz Sharif government for trying to pitch Khan against the country’s powerful Army. Sharif subsequently fled the country.
A month after he left Pakistan, ARY TV fired Sharif, saying he had repeatedly criticised the military on social media in violation of the company’s policy.

In October last year, he was shot dead in Nairobi, in what the Kenyan authorities claim was a case of “mistaken identity.” But in December last year, Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordered the federal government to constitute a special Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the case after the initial investigation revealed the murder was “premeditated.” Sharif was awarded the ‘Pride of Performance’ in 2019 by Pakistan President Arif Alvi.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/journalists-police-clash-at-gaddafi-stadium-in-pakistans-lahore-city-8469888/,sports

“It is important we take control of every hour, and not look at the big picture, just go from session to session.”
West Indies have lost 12 of their previous 15 tests in South Africa and won just one, though this is the first time they have toured the country in the longest format since 2015. Their only victory was a surprise success in Gqeberha 16 years ago.
Brathwaite, who opens the batting, concedes it will be a big step up from what they faced in Zimbabwe and it will be up to the batters to lay the platform for success against the home side’s vaunted pace attack on helpful wickets.

Murray pulls out of Dubai due to recurring hip injury,"The 35-year-old, a three-times Grand Slam champion, is no stranger to hip problems and was on the verge of retirement in 2019 after having surgery the previous year.","Andy Murray has withdrawn from the Dubai Tennis Championships this week due to a recurring hip issue, tournament organisers said on Monday.
The 35-year-old, a three-times Grand Slam champion, is no stranger to hip problems and was on the verge of retirement in 2019 after having surgery the previous year.
However, he got his career back on track after another operation and stormed into his fourth ATP final since returning to the tour at last week’s Qatar Open where he was beaten by Daniil Medvedev.
“We regret to inform you that Andy Murray is unable to participate in this year’s tournament,” Dubai organisers said in a post on Twitter. “Andy has been dealing with a recurring hip injury that has unfortunately forced him out of Dubai.”
Murray said after his defeat by Medvedev that he would have to manage his body better, especially after physically demanding matches.

Williamson surpasses Taylor as New Zealand’s most prolific test batter,"The former captain hit paceman James Anderson through midwicket for four with the fourth ball of the morning at Wellington's Basin Reserve on day four to pass Taylor's mark of 7,683 runs.","Kane Williamson cemented his claim as New Zealand’s greatest test batsman after he eclipsed Ross Taylor as the nation’s leading run-scorer on the way to an inspirational century against England in the second test on Monday.
The former captain hit paceman James Anderson through midwicket for four with the fourth ball of the morning at Wellington’s Basin Reserve on day four to pass Taylor’s mark of 7,683 runs.
By tea, Williamson had chalked up his 26th century in tests to give the hosts some hope of pulling off an unlikely win after they were asked to follow on.
As always, the mild-mannered 32-year-old from Tauranga kept the emotions in check, barely acknowledging the warm applause from the crowd after taking the runs record.
Later in the day, after being caught behind for 132 off Harry Brook’s part-time medium pace, Williamson showed he has lost none of his discomfort talking about his achievements.
“It’s not something that I’ve sort of thought about a whole lot but it is an honour,” he told reporters of the record.
“I look at that list and I’ve admired all of those players over the years, whether that’s watching from afar growing up or playing alongside a number of them as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s not a focus point, but it’s special to be amongst that company.”
A nation of 5 million, New Zealand has produced a slew of brilliant cricketers over the decades but none have made their mark with the bat quite like Williamson.
Taylor’s tally of runs came from 112 matches, while Williamson, now on 7,787 runs at an average of 53.33, is playing his 92nd test.
Former team mate Taylor, who retired last year, was quick to congratulate him.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This achievement is a testament to your hard work and dedication to test cricket, of which I was privy to for a number of years,” he said.
“Here’s to many more.”
Williamson managed only 10 runs across his three previous innings of the series against England but answered the team’s call for a big score on Monday.
He batted superbly through a 282-ball knock, anchoring partnerships with Henry Nicholls (29), Daryl Mitchell (54) and Tom Blundell (90) in New Zealand’s second innings of 483.
Tim Southee’s side will bid to record just the fourth win in history by a team asked to follow on.

Should they pull it off, they will have their quiet talisman Williamson to thank for setting up the chance.

WPL great platform to make India comeback: Poonam Yadav,"The Delhi Capitals player, who is hoping to take the WPL route to regain her place in the national side, added the tournament will take Indian women's cricket to the next level.","Seasoned India leg-spinner Poonam Yadav believes the Women’s Premier League (WPL) will not just provide a great opportunity to senior players to come back into national reckoning, it will also be a boon for young players to learn from international stars.
The Delhi Capitals player, who is hoping to take the WPL route to regain her place in the national side, added the tournament will take Indian women’s cricket to the next level.
The 31-year-old last played for India in an ODI against Bangladesh in March last year and was bought by the Delhi franchise for the inaugural WPL edition for Rs 30 lakh.
The WPL is scheduled to commence on March 4 with the match between Gujarat Giants and Mumbai Indians.
“The experienced players can utilise the WPL as a platform to make a comeback and the youngsters will get a chance to showcase their talent in the tournament,” Poonam said in a Delhi Capitals media release.
“We can also learn from foreign players and they will learn from us as well. The WPL will take Indian cricket to great heights.” Delhi Capitals’ star-studded 18-member side boasts of Meg Lanning, who became the most decorated captain in the history of the game after leading Australia to a record-extending sixth Women’s T20 World Cup title with a 19-run win over South Africa in Cape Town on Sunday.
Having won five World Cup titles for Australia, Lanning surpassed compatriot Ricky Ponting’s feat of four trophies and three by Mahendra Singh Dhoni in ICC events.

Delhi Capitals also have South African pace bowling all-rounder Marizanne Kapp along with the star Indian batting duo of Shafali Verma and Jemimah Rodrigues on their roster.
Top-order batter Jasia Akhtar from Jammu and Kashmir said she is relishing the prospect of playing alongside Lanning and Kapp.
“I switched off the TV when my name came up in the WPL auction. I switched off my phone for 15 minutes as well,” the 34-year-old recalled.
“I got a call from my brother after I switched on my phone and he told me that I had been picked by Delhi Capitals. I didn’t believe him, but then I spoke with my parents and they were very excited. I felt proud after being taken by such a big franchise. I am excited to play with Meg Lanning and Marizanne Kapp.” All-rounder Arundhati Reddy, who last played for India in a T20I against England in July 2021, is also looking forward to the “opportunity” of playing alongside international stars.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We’ve been waiting for the WPL for a long time. It’s a great opportunity for us to rub shoulders with some of the greats of the game,” the 25-year-old said.
“I went unsold in the first round of auction and I was not sure if my name would come (up) again. Jemimah (Rodrigues) called me and told me that I had been picked up by Delhi Capitals and that’s how I got to know. She was very excited,” she added.
‘Player of the Match’ in India’s Women’s U-19 T20 World Cup triumph last month, Titas Sadhu said getting picked by Delhi Capitals was a “huge relief” for her.

IND vs AUS: Starc says still not 100 per cent fit but good enough for third Test,"With skipper Pat Cummins back home to be with his unwell mother, Australia will rely on Starc to provide the odd breakthrough and support the spinners.","Senior Australian pacer Mitchell Starc has still not ‘100 per cent’ recovered from his injury but is ready to make an impact in the third Test against India beginning here on Wednesday.
With skipper Pat Cummins back home to be with his unwell mother, Australia will rely on Starc to provide the odd breakthrough and support the spinners.
Indian pacers have already made a substantial contribution in the series with Mohammed Shami being the standout fast bowler.
“I am feeling fine. There’s going to be a level of discomfort for a while. I don’t think it’s going to be a 100 per cent for a fair while, but it’s good enough.
“The ball is coming out quite nicely and I am bowling at full tilt. It won’t be the first Test that I will play with some sort of discomfort. If I only played when I was 100 per cent, I would have only played 5-10 Tests,” said Starc ahead of Australia’s opening practice session here.
Like the Indian pacers have done for their team, Starc too wants to make a significant contribution. He bowled full tilt for an hour to Cameron Green in the nets.
“Yeah, it’s been a challenge for the Australian seamers. We do see spin obviously playing a huge part, but the Indian quicks have still played a particular role with the new ball. And if it does reverse, they have brought the stumps into play. No doubt that spin will play a huge role again, but I will have to play an important role with the spinners to take those 20 wickets,” said the left-arm quick.
ADVERTISEMENT
Starc and Green are the likely pace options for Australia in the game. In Delhi, Cummins was the only fast-bowling option at the team’s disposal with the visitors going with three specialist spinners.
The 33-year-old, who has played 75 Tests, hopes the experience of playing in the sub-continent helps him here. He is also feeling good about his body.
“There is no concern at all. I had 8-10 days off after the injury. Since then, I have been bowling. Workload or body-wise, no concerns. I am happy with where my body is at. It’s now about executing the skills.
“Not sure anything has worked for me in the past here. I haven’t played a heap of cricket here. I think having those experiences in Pakistan and Sri Lanka recently will play a part.

"If you don’t score in India, you will get flak: Ganguly on KL Rahul","Stripped of vice captaincy, Rahul hasn't crossed 25-run mark in his last 10 Test knocks. An average of less than 35 in 47 Tests isn't an actual realisation of his real potential.","It will be difficult for KL Rahul to avoid scathing criticism for his protracted poor run because of the enormous expectations attached with the job, especially when past cricketers have set high standards, says former India skipper Sourav Ganguly.
Stripped of vice captaincy, Rahul hasn’t crossed 25-run mark in his last 10 Test knocks. An average of less than 35 in 47 Tests isn’t an actual realisation of his real potential.
“When you don’t score runs in India, obviously you will get flak. KL Rahul hasn’t been the only one. There have been players in the past also,” Ganguly told PTI in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of Delhi Capitals’ IPL pre-season camp.
Ganguly tried to put things in perspective as to why the Bengaluru man is being persisted with despite repeated failures.
“There’s so much focus and attention with lot of pressure on players. The team management thinks he is an important player for the team. At the end of the day, what coach and captain thinks is important,” the veteran of 113 Tests and 311 ODIs said.
While Rahul has played some quality knocks in England and Australia, Ganguly said it’s obvious that people will expect way more from a talented player like Rahul, who has managed just five Test hundreds in nine years.
“He has performed but obviously you expect a lot more from a top order batter playing for India because the standards set by others are so high.
ADVERTISEMENT
“When you fail for a while, obviously there will be criticism. I am sure Rahul has ability and I am sure as and when he gets more opportunities, he will have to find ways to score,” he explained.
So is Rahul’s problem technical or mental? “Both,” pat comes the reply.
But the former BCCI President also gave an interesting insight into Rahul’s lack of runs as he is getting out to pacers as well as spinners in all conditions in recent times.
“It also makes it hard if you are playing on these sort of pitches as the balls are turning and bouncing. There’s uneven bounce and when you are not in form, it makes it even more harder.” Shubman has to wait
ADVERTISEMENT
There has been a clamour to include Shubman Gill in the playing XI but Ganguly feels that the Punjab man will get his share of chances and there’s no harm if he has to wait a little bit.
But what do you tell a Shubman, who has to cool his heels when he is in red hot form? “I am sure when his time comes, he will also get a lot of opportunities. I think the selectors, the captain and the coach think of him and rate him very highly. That’s why he is playing ODIs and T20Is, and he has performed as well.
“But at the present moment, perhaps message from team management is that he has to wait.” While India have cantered to victories in both the Tests, the top order batters except Rohit Sharma have flattered to deceive with none getting a fifty.
Is the concept of dominant batters against spinners sounding too alien nowadays? “I don’t think so. These are very tough wickets. I saw in the first two Tests and it’s not easy boss. Playing Ashwin, Jadeja, Lyon and the new guy Todd Murphy, it is never easy with odd ball turning square. There is unevenness, there is everything happening for spinners.” This is not Steve Waugh’s team
ADVERTISEMENT
India have won two Test matches in a cumulative duration of five days of cricket and Ganguly isn’t surprised.
“India is a different beast in India. They are a pretty good team all around but in India they are pretty hard to beat. When it starts turning, they are a better side than anyone,” he was sharp in his response.
Is the scoreline of 4-0 a real possibility for India? “I think so. I don’t know how Australia can stop it,” he was practical while assessing Australia’s performance.
“The problem is, we keep comparing this Australian team from the teams of the past and it’s not the same. You don’t have a Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting, Steve and Mark Waugh, (Adam) Gilchrist, you name them. You don’t have that quality.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Steve Smith is a great player. (David) Warner hasn’t got going, (Marnus) Labuschagne is a good player but these are tough conditions for him as well.
“The mistake we make with Australian teams is that we think they are Steve Waugh’s Australia but that’s not the case. Different players get tested differently in different conditions.” Been in touch with Pant
Ganguly is the Director of Cricket for the Delhi Capitals and one of the toughest challenges for him is to fill in the void created due to unavailability of Rishabh Pant, who met with a horrific accident and underwent surgery recently.
“I spoke to him a couple of times. Obviously he is going through a tough period, through injuries and surgeries and I wish him well. In a year’s time or may be in a couple of years’ time, he will be back playing for India,” Ganguly’s voice had a tinge of sadness as he spoke about a player he has been very fond of.
ADVERTISEMENT
Will he like to see Pant being with the team for some time during IPL which could also help in his recovery.
“Don’t know. We will see,” Ganguly said.
DC is yet to announce Pant’s replacement and Ganguly is still undecided on who is better between young turk Abhishek Porel and domestic veteran Sheldon Jackson.
“We still need a bit of time to figure out. The next camp starts before IPL.” While David Warner is set to lead DC, Axar Patel will be his deputy this season.
Ganguly monitored a three-day camp in Kolkata which the likes of Prithvi Shaw, Ishant Sharma, Chetan Sakariya, Manish Pandey attended along with other domestic players.

England chase 210 runs for victory after pulsating day four,New Zealand captain Tim Southee bowled Crawley for 24 but opener Ben Duckett (23 not out) and nightwatchman Ollie Robinson (one not out) negotiated the tense final overs at the Basin Reserve.,"England lost opener Zak Crawley but held firm in the final hour of a pulsating day four in the second test against New Zealand to be 48 for one at stumps in Wellington on Monday, needing 210 runs to secure victory and a series sweep.
New Zealand captain Tim Southee bowled Crawley for 24 but opener Ben Duckett (23 not out) and nightwatchman Ollie Robinson (one not out) negotiated the tense final overs at the Basin Reserve.
England will fancy their chances of reeling in the remaining runs on day five after chasing down a slew of big scores in the home summer.
New Zealand, however, will rue having missed the chance to set a bigger fourth-innings target.
England spinner Jack Leach said he was looking forward to an exciting final day.
“We know how we are going to go about things, we’ll be positive, entertain the crowd, we’ll be doing the same tomorrow,” he added.
England rattled through the last five wickets after tea to wrest back the advantage after an inspiring Kane Williamson century raised the hosts’ hopes of an unlikely victory.
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked to follow on, New Zealand were bowled out for 483 in their second innings but it could have been much more.
Williamson scored 132 and anchored a big partnership with wicketkeeper Tom Blundell (90), the pair frustrating the English bowlers for the entire session to tea.
They had resumed on 423 for five after the break, looking well set to carry on.
Enter golden boy Harry Brooks, who provided the unlikely breakthrough for England when he had Williamson caught down the legside with his part-time medium pace.

New Zealand promptly crumbled, losing their last four wickets for five runs.
All-rounder Michael Bracewell hastened the collapse by being run out for eight when he failed to ground his bat, a howling error given he had jogged well past the line when Ben Foakes whipped off the bails.

"With win over world number 2 Carlos Alcaraz, distance-running enthusiast Cameron Norrie shows he has gas in tank for the long haul",The South-Africa born 27-year-old Norrie won his fifth ATP Tour title in Rio Open on Sunday,"As a player at the Texas Christian University (TCU), British Tennis player Cameron Norrie once ran a 10km marathon post his training session. The 27-year-old, who has competed in marathon five-setters on the ATP Tour circuit in the past, got the better of world number two Carlos Alcaraz of Spain with a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 win in the final of the Rio Open in Argentina to claim his fifth ATP Tour title. Norrie, who had reached Wimbledon semi-finals last year, before his loss against Novak Djokovic, is known for his fitness drills in the tennis circuit and that’s what his coach Devin Bowen had recalled.
“On his day off, he loves to run. He loves long-distance running as a hobby. There was a 10K in town and he just went and he didn’t text, he just did it. He ran the 10K and won it. It was like, ‘Yes, that’s great that you did that, but the whole point of today was to rest your body and we’re going to start up again.’ So he won the Fort Worth 10k, and that was just on a day off. It kind of gives you an idea of what kind of animal you’re dealing with,” Devin Bowen, assistant coach at TCU had told ATP Tour in an interview earlier.

Born to a Scottish father and a Welsh mother in Johannesburg in South Africa, a young Norrie grew up in Auckland and also represented New Zealand at the junior level. According to his mother Helen as reported by The Guardian, the youngster’s first tennis racket was a refurbished squad racket and Norrie played with it at the age of six in their backyard in their home in Auckland. Norrie moved to London having pledging allegiance to Britain at the age of 16 and was chosen for a scholarship at the Texas Christian University supported by London Tennis Association.
He spent more than four years in the USA before turning professional in 2017. Within an year, Norrie won his first Davis Cup match with a win over the then world number 23 Roberto Bautista Agut with former British Davis Cup captain John Lloyd terming his debut as one of the most impressive debuts in Davis Cup. The year also saw him making his Wimbledon main draw debut, where he lost to Jo-Wifried Tsonga in the first round before he made a second round appearance in the US Open. Starting 2021 at a world ranking of 74th, Corrie had 52 single’s wins on the ATP Tour with two titles resulting in his rise to world number 12.

Norrie broke into the top-1 in world rankings last year with his fourth ATP Tour title in Lyon, France before he reached the Wimbledon semi-finals with a 3-6, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 win over David Goffin. Though he lost to eventual champion Djokovic in the semi-finals in a four-set match, Norrie termed the quarter-final win against Goffin as a crazy day. He would also cycle from his London home to Wimbledon courts during the tournament. “Not had too much time for it to sink in, but it was just a crazy day, and to do it in the way that I did in five sets, coming back from two-sets-to-one, I can’t really describe it. Just a lot of emotions, and a pretty sick match to get through. I’m just glad they (his parents) got to witness it and they definitely deserve a glass of wine each.” Norrie had told Sky Sports post the match.

Last December, Norrie scored a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over former world number one Rafael Nadal in a United Cup match. He had never won a set against Nadal in their four previous matches but his win gave Great Britain a 1-0 lead in the tie. Sunday’s title was Norrie’s fifth title on the ATP Tour and the 27-year-old won the match with an ace in the final set to win his second title on clay. “It’s so special to win this one especially after losing a couple of finals already this year. I had to do it the tough way, I was a set and a break down and 0-30 on my serve. I managed to flick a switch and turn it around, so it was a good day.” Norrie said post the win.
The 27-year-old also plans to run marathons post his tennis career. On being asked about his love for running, he had shared his views on running marathons post his tennis career. “I would maybe like to after tennis. I quite enjoy running, but I haven’t been able to do that much.

IND vs AUS: Mark Taylor terms Indian pitches as unique and suited for Indian batsmen,The former Australian captain finds Australian batsmen execution of shots as poor and terms Indian pitches as unique,"With the Australian Test team going into the third Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Indore trailing by 0-2, former Australian captain Mark Taylor has questioned the execution by the Australian batsmen on ‘Unique’ Indian pitches. With Australia losing the first Test in Nagpur by an innings and 132 runs followed by a six-wicket loss in the second Test in Delhi, Taylor also termed the pitches in India as unique.
“Yes, conditions in India are different. Yes, the Australian side goes there more often these days with the IPL. But the pitches there are unique. There is not a doubt about that. They are putting out slow low turners, which suit their type of play. And we are not used to playing on those types of pitches. We went over there with a mentality to be positive to take it on, be aggressive which is not a bad mentality to have. But you gotta have a technique for that. The execution was poor in the second Test,” said Taylor while speaking with Wide World of Sports.
While Australia has been suffering from a selection dilemma in the four Test series, the side has left without captain Pat Cummins. The pacer has gone back to Australia citing a family emergency and Steve Smith will be captaining the side in his absence. Taylor, who played in 104 Test matches for Australia amassing 7525 runs, recalled Australia’s comeback in the last match of the three-Test series in India in 1998. With Australia losing the first match at Chennai by 179 runs followed by an innings and 219 runs in Kolkata, the then Taylor-led Australian team scored an eight-wicket win in the third Test match at Bangalore.

“I did not play a lot of Test matches in India. In 1998, we got beaten in the first test at Chennai in a pretty good game. Second Test, we played at Eden Gardens and got absolutely hammered. It’s not unique what has happened to the Australian team, it’s happened in the past too. We got beaten by an innings and 220 runs in Eden Gardens. It’s not too much fun. That’s what happened this time. All the sudden, you find the game moves ahead very quickly. As we saw with Australia on Day three in the last test match. All of a sudden, things start going in the wrong direction, it’s hard to stop the momentum. That’s happened with us in Eden Gardens. The good news for us was that we did turn it around in the final test in Bengaluru. We won on a much better even pitch. You can turn it around but it’s not easy when the pitches are as they are now,” said Taylor.
While Taylor has blamed the pitches, the former Australian captain praised the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. “Those pitches are unique as I said. They suit the two Ravis ( Ashwin and Jadeja) very well. You always bowl stump to stump and they are always challenging your front pad and stumps. That’s why the sweep and reverse sweep are dangerous. You miss the ball and you are going to be out. It’s a high risk shot,” said Taylor.

Taylor also believes that the Australian selector will take a decision about the future of opener David Warner. While Warner will miss the remaining two Test matches in India after an elbow injury, the Australian opener has shared that he wants to continue playing till 2024. “Dave has come out and said he wants to be around until 2024, so he wants to go to England later this year, he wants to play in Australia next summer. So he has really thrown the ball over to (selectors) George Bailey, Tony Dodemaide, (and captain) Pat Cummins, the selectors to say ‘OK what do you want to do?’.To me, the selectors have got to make a decision.

Or they make a decision now and say righto, we’re going to take the two younger guys… we’re going to make a change right now,” said Taylor.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-mark-taylor-terms-indian-pitches-as-unique-and-suited-for-indian-batsmen-8468849/,sports
‘Social media pushed me over the edge … to alcoholism’: South Africa’s Sinalo Jafta opens up after T20 World Cup final loss,"Luckily, with the help of her family and friends, she regained what she had after a 56-days treatment. Her mother is a single mom who brought Jafta and her brother on a teacher’s salary.","“Two months ago, I came out of rehab,” South Africa’s wicket-keeper batter Sinalo Jafta would say after South Africa’ heartbreaking loss in the T20 world cup final. “I’ve got God to thank for my sobriety, and the team have been so supportive. I came out on December 8, and for me to get fit, to play… hectic. What a journey. The person you get on the field is someone who gets on their knees every day. I am not in control of anything. God is always in control.”
It turns out it was social media vitriol that pushed her to alcoholism. ”Social media, it doesn’t support you. You have a really tough day and people just bullet you. That sent me over the edge. It just wouldn’t stop. I remember coming back from the Commonwealth Games [in August] and everything just broke. I lost who I was.”
Luckily, with the help of her family and friends, she regained what she had after a 56-days treatment. Her mother is a single mom who brought Jafta and her brother on a teacher’s salary.
“My mom [Lumka Jafta] was one of the people who supported me through it, and the team doctor and the management gave me two months’ medical leave. I was in treatment for 56 days. I learnt the best about myself. People are allowed to have their opinions but it doesn’t define who I am.”
Jafta, who kept the wickets and hit nine runs in the final, says she was about to walk away from cricket.
“I was walking away from cricket. October 7 is when I made the decision I was going to go into treatment. I was done. I felt like I had nothing left to give. I was 27. I was done. Now, as a 28-year-old, I’ve got my career ahead of me. The fact that I can say I have a career ahead of me.”

"‘Surreal to be that many weeks number one, to match Steffi Graf – one of the all-time greats,’ Djokovic",Djokovic suffered a three-centimetre hamstring tear en route to winning the Adelaide warm-up event before claiming his 22nd Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park to go level with Rafa Nadal.,"Novak Djokovic said he was now playing without pain after recovering from a hamstring injury as he prepares to return to the ATP Tour in Dubai this week following his record-extending 10th Australian Open title last month.
Djokovic suffered a three-centimetre hamstring tear en route to winning the Adelaide warm-up event before claiming his 22nd Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park to go level with Rafa Nadal.
The 35-year-old Serb said his Dubai participation was in doubt until a few days ago but he had passed all his fitness tests.
“Had a couple of weeks of no tennis. The last few days it’s really getting as much practice as possible to get myself back in shape to be able to compete at a high level,” Djokovic said.
“I haven’t felt pain on the court for a week. I’m getting closer to 100%. Still not there in terms of the game and how I feel on court. But the important thing is there’s no pain. I don’t have a hindrance in the way I move on the court.
“After every injury it takes time for mechanisms to be balanced, for adjustments to be done on court. It takes time to find that groove of moving effortlessly and not thinking about if something’s going to happen. I don’t have those thoughts.”
Djokovic begins the Dubai tournament having entered his 378th week as world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf as the player with the most weeks at the top of the sport.

In the past two years, he has worked really hard on his bowling and his fitness has improved as well. He wants to look good and speaks well.

Jake Paul takes first ring defeat by split decision to Fury,"Fury is the first actual professional boxer fought by Paul, who built his lucrative second career by taking on mixed martial artists and a fellow YouTuber in boxing bouts that generated huge social media attention despite featuring more enthusiasm than skill.","YouTube star Jake Paul took the first defeat of his professional boxing career Sunday night, losing a split decision to Tommy Fury.
Paul (6-1) knocked down Fury with a short left hand early in the final round of their cruiserweight bout, but the younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury controlled long stretches of the eight-round meeting at Diriyah Arena.
Two judges scored the bout 76-73 for Fury (9-0, 4 KOs), while the third favored Paul, 75-74.
“I’ve already won every single way in life,” Paul said. “I made it farther than I ever thought I would, and beyond. This is a humbling experience. I’ll take it on the chin and come back.”

Fury is the first actual professional boxer fought by Paul, who built his lucrative second career by taking on mixed martial artists and a fellow YouTuber in boxing bouts that generated huge social media attention despite featuring more enthusiasm than skill.
Fury also is much better known as a celebrity sibling — and much more accomplished as a reality television star — than as a boxer, leading to a relatively even matchup with Paul. Fury’s unbeaten record entering this bout was built against a series of wildly overmatched opponents with a combined record of 24-176-5.
“In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Both fighters had good moments in the first four rounds in front of a star-studded crowd in Saudi Arabia, but Fury landed more significant shots behind a consistent jab that allowed him to keep Paul at a distance.
Paul appeared to stun Fury with an accurate left hook early in the fifth round, but he also lost a point when the referee penalized him, apparently for pushing down on Fury’s head in a clinch. The referee then took a point from Fury in the sixth, apparently for excessive clinching.
Fury had a strong seventh round despite a cut near his left eye from a clash of heads, repeatedly tagging Paul with combinations. But Paul abruptly reversed the momentum with a perfectly timed left that wobbled Fury, who put his left glove on the canvas to steady himself and bounced up immediately.
Fury finished strong and claimed the decision.
Fury and Paul were slated to meet two times previously, but Fury was unavailable for both showdowns. He injured a rib before their scheduled bout in December 2021, and he was denied entry to the U.S. last summer ahead of a planned meeting in August.

"Harbhajan Singh: ‘Not in terms of skills, but mentally, this is the most fragile Australian cricket team’","One of the stars of India’s 2001 comeback series victory against Australia, Harbhajan Singh, the off-spinner, always performed well against the arch rivals.","Harbhajan Singh on Australian Cricket Team: In this Idea Exchange, former cricketer and AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP Harbhajan Singh discusses the mental fragility of the visiting Australian team, what India should do to win ICC trophies and why politics minus rancour is the way to go ahead. The session was moderated by Devendra Pandey, Senior Assistant Editor.
Devendra Pandey: Do you think this is the most mentally fragile Australian team to tour India?
If you compare to other Australian teams which toured earlier — we don’t want to go 30-40 years back but even if we go that far — I think this is probably the weakest team. Not in terms of skills, mentally they are very fragile. They are not able to handle pressure the way the Aussies used to. It’ll be fair to say this is not the Aussie-Aussie kind of team that we used to see or play against.
Read | If the BCCI wants a player of stature as chief selector, then pay as much as head coach gets: Harbhajan Singh
Devendra Pandey: Can you elaborate on what this team lacks?
The Aussies used to have a lot of plans before touring any country. They understood the conditions better than the other teams. That’s the reason they were a bit more successful than others, even in India. This team, particularly, are clueless. They don’t have any plans. In the first game, they were clueless. They knew these conditions would be challenging for any batter — the ball will spin from the first ball. It’s not something that’s started to happen now; it’s been happening for the last eight-10 years. In 2012-13, they lost on similar wickets. They were clueless even at that point in time but they fought better than this. But this team, I don’t see anyone standing up and taking those challenges and trying to do something different than what others are doing. Before the first Test even began, there was so much chaos. They were thinking about what will happen, will the pitches spin. They even got a bowler like R Ashwin at nets. But when you bat at nets and you bat in the middle, those are two different things. So you’ve hyped up among yourselves about how Ashwin and (Ravindran) Jadeja will bowl. So what! No matter how the pitch is, you should know how to manage the game. Know that 200-250 will be a good score… At least try to get that somehow. I couldn’t see any of this planning.
I have spent 20-odd years in cricket and enjoyed every bit of it. Today, whatever I am is because of the game. Even the reason why I was given the MP seat is because I am Harbhajan Singh, the cricketer
Devendra Pandey: What happened in the second Test?
In the second Test, they thought attack is the best option. That’s true when things are under your control. But when you are trying to attack the opposition, you still need to assess the bounce and spin of the pitch; who the bowlers are; what are the scoring options and how often will you attack. But that was not the case. They were trying to play those sweep shots which was not the right option. The ball was staying low. Again, this isn’t a new phenomenon. It’s been happening from the time since the stadium, which is now named after Arun Jaitleyji, was called Kotla. When the ball is keeping low, sweep is the worst option you can apply. Out of the 10 wickets, seven fell to sweep shots and one batsman lost his back stump while trying to hit a reverse sweep. That shows there wasn’t any plan and the one they had wasn’t right. So, if this is the way the Australian team is thinking, this is probably the worst I have seen…

Devendra Pandey: Is the art of defence dying?
To be fair, these are very challenging conditions even for our batters. If spinners are bowling, it’s very challenging for any batter to defend. But you need to learn the art of how to defend. Suddenly, if you come to India and think you’ll learn defence in three-four sessions, that’s not going to happen. You see how (Cheteshwar) Pujara bats or any Indian batsmen. They play with soft hands. But they still get out because the wicket is doing so much. When the wicket is so challenging, no batsman is set even when you are batting at 70-80. One good ball will take your wicket. These are tough conditions, not just for Aussies but for Indians also, but Indians are doing better because they are kind of used to it. It’ll be very harsh for me to say they (Australians) don’t know how to play. They do, but these are challenging conditions, these snake-biting conditions are making life very difficult for a batsman.
The BCCI is right. We shouldn’t be sending our team to Pakistan. Even recently, some firing happened next to Karachi stadium. You don’t want to send your team to a place where anything can happen at any time
You see the averages of our Indian batsmen have dropped drastically in the last eight-nine years. Ajinkya (Rahane) mentioned the other day that one of the reasons his average fell was that Indian pitches were such that it was impossible to bat on them. So, it is difficult to pinpoint anyone on these pitches… to say (Australian cricketer) David Warner isn’t playing well, or someone else for that matter. But yes, their intent isn’t correct.

Venkata Krishna B: With influence of spinners getting reduced overall in limited-overs cricket, should ICC go back to just one ball, as every second World Cup is going to happen in the Indian subcontinent?
ADVERTISEMENT
There has to be some balance between bat and ball. Now, everything tilts towards the batsman. If I am an off-spinner, I will have to have point or mid-off in at all times. It becomes a challenge for spinners as well as fast bowlers. There needs to be some cushion for them. As long as the ball is new, there will be swing. Around the 25-over mark, the ball is in the best condition for hitting. So, from the 25th to 35th overs, when the ball will get old, reverse swing will be there and spinners will be able to bowl in the later stages as they will be able to grip the ball better. So, the old rule was much better. Two different balls from two ends, and five fielders inside the circle is too much in favour of the batsmen. You talk to any of the greats — Brian Lara, Jacques Kallis, Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni — they will say it was hard work to score a hundred. You will not see scores of 340, 380 getting chased. Now, just because you have two new balls, which are harder balls, and five fielders in, those runs are not safe enough and getting chased most of the time.
Venkata Krishna B: Is there a dearth of off-spinners coming through the system now?
The shorter format is killing the art of spin bowling. Nobody wants to take up the challenge, because with IPL, we see different bowlers doing different sort of stuff, not proper off-spin or left-arm spin. Left-arm spinners are trying to bring the ball in, rather than spinning the ball. The same goes for off-spinners. They are not spinning the ball in, but taking it away, or trying the knuckle ball. The mindset has changed.

It’s an altogether different field for me. I have spent 20-odd years in cricket and enjoyed every bit of it. Today, whatever I am is because of the game. Even the reason why I was given the MP seat is because I am Harbhajan Singh, the cricketer. I am still very new, very raw in politics and trying to know how things work. Being at Parliament sessions, meeting the big people of our country, the decision-makers, is an experience. Sharing my knowledge, getting to know their mind in a lot of different aspects of life and what is happening in India is obviously a big learning. The more time I spend in it, the more I am trying to learn from different people. I try to keep as much track as I can of these political agendas — what is happening in India — and try to raise the same issues in Parliament and also what is happening recently in Delhi with (the election of the) mayor and stuff between the BJP and AAP.
Mallica Joshi: What is your overall sense of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) mayoral poll issue in Delhi?
Whatever happened there isn’t a good thing and it’s not a good sight for people of any country watching the proceedings. It is not the right thing to do and a lot of people are watching you. No matter which party you belong to, this kind of behaviour is not right at all. You can sit and talk to find a solution to issues. But if we take this approach, it will just keep on swinging back and forth. I am too young to say what is right or wrong but issues can be resolved by sitting and talking. For that, people from both sides must come forward, putting their pride aside. They need to find the right solution and I think these things can be sorted out very easily.
Tushar Bhaduri: Has left-arm spin become the most effective style of spin bowling?
ADVERTISEMENT
Those bowlers who aim at the stumps will do well. You see how good Ashwin and Jadeja’s records are. Axar Patel played when England visited India and his record is good as well. Left arm-spinners are effective because when the ball stays straight, the batsman tries to save the pad and when the batsman tries to save the pad, the bat comes in. And if the ball spins from there, the slip and the keeper come into play.
Nihal Koshie: At the moment, there is no chief selector. How important is it for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to hire someone with stature?
A man with stature, one that has played the game quite often, will solve a lot of issues at the selector level. But why wouldn’t they take up the opportunity? I’ll give the example of Virender Sehwag.
If you ask Virender Sehwag to become the chief selector, then the salary of that post needs to be analysed. I don’t know how much the chief selector in India earns, but if Sehwag is in commentary or in other businesses around cricket, then iti s likely he is earning more money. If you want Sehwag, a player with stature, for the chief selector’s job, then spending money has to be key. If you don’t spend money, then you will have to choose selectors from players who may have only played a year and might not be that big a name. If a man like Rahul Dravid is made the coach, then the chief selector must have the same stature as well — jiski awaaz mein dum ho, jiske wajood mein dum ho (whose voice and stature carry weight).
ADVERTISEMENT
Nihal Koshie: If the BCCI pays more, will you be open to become the chief selector?
Let’s see. If things shape up moving forward, and coach and selector are equally paid, then why not?
The job of the coach is to stay with the team and plan around the team. But team selection is also an equally important job. You have to pick and select the best players and if you don’t select players that are needed by the coach or captain, then the chief selectors position doesn’t have value.

Navjeevan Gopal: I wanted to ask you about the Asia Cup controversy between India and Pakistan and what do you think of the BCCI’s role in it?
ADVERTISEMENT
I think the BCCI is right. We shouldn’t be sending our team to Pakistan. Even recently, some firing happened next to Karachi stadium. You don’t want to send your team to a place where anything can happen at any time. Any place which can be a security issue for players shouldn’t be considered.
Devendra Pandey: Should the BCCI monitor the work load better to make players play longer?
A machine runs well when it’s used regularly but not overworked and overused; it will go bad. Jasprit Bumrah or any other talent should be treated likewise. Take Yuzvendra Chahal, no one takes his name these days, but his record is so good. Or Ashwin. If you want these players to play long, then there should be a rest period, think what’s good for them. Rest is as important as playing. Else, the body slowly and surely will break down. The day it breaks down, then no one knows after six months or a year, how it will function.
Tushar Bhaduri: Was it easy to transition as a commentator?

Playing is tough, and the real fun is in playing. On mike, you can share your mind, what you feel is happening in the game — what can happen, what should happen, according to your experience. It’s fun as it’s still to do something with the game that I love and played. It allows me to stay connected with the game in some capacity. I am still trying to learn every day; you see a new shot, new ball.
Devendra Pandey: Why has India not been able to win an ICC event for a while now?
It has become a bit of a pattern. In 2018-19 we saw that there was a lot of shuffling of players. Dinesh Karthik was playing, Rishabh Pant was also playing… How to win a big match, there is a little lack of experience. Big matches are high pressure. World Cup pressure is different from bilateral series. Bigger the tournament, the higher the pressure is. Very few people actually take that kind of pressure. We used to say that if Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli make runs, then India will win. But now there is Hardik Pandya. We have more players now (potential match-winners) and I hope this trend will change. With the kind of talent we have, I think we should be able to. If you are unable to win with the talent we have, then when will you win?
Devendra Pandey: This year the 50-over World Cup is being played in India. So what can the team do differently?
I think we need to show a little more intent. If you are playing T20s then you can’t play it like a one-day match. If you are playing one-day, you can’t play it like a Test match. We can’t be dependent on two-three players to win you the championship. When you have a World Cup in front of you, you need eight to nine guys performing at the same time. One or two players can win you matches, but it is the team which can win you the tournament.
Devendra Pandey: Going ahead, do we need a younger coach for the T20 format?
Yes, you have two captains, so you can have two coaches. Why not? Someone whose planning is different. Like England has done with Brendon McCullum. Someone like Virender Sehwag or Ashish Nehra who worked with Gujarat Titans and Hardik Pandya won his first tournament (IPL) as captain. So, bring someone who understands the concept of T20 and the demands of the game. The coach knows that focus is on T20 cricket. Say if Nehra is the T20 coach, then he knows that his job is to make the Indian team champions in the T20 format, and Dravid knows he has to work on how the Indian team can be No.1 in Tests and ODIs.

It was pretty special: Meg Lanning on record-extending sixth T20 WC title,A dominant Australia on Sunday defeated hosts South Africa by 19 runs in the final to clinch a hat-trick of T20 World Cup titles and extend their domination in world cricket.,"Australia captain Meg Lanning has termed their record-extending sixth ICC Women’s T20 World Cup title as a “special” effort from the group, saying she was super proud of the feat.

“It’s pretty special from the group. All teams came hard at us but super proud. We felt like it was a good score but we have to bowl well. It was not as good as the semi-final. We had to put pressure on South Africa. It was about enjoying the process and do what we were doing. It was about keeping things simple when the pressure is on,” Lanning said after the win.
“Thoroughly enjoyed it. We were able to get out and see what this country has to offer. Nice to enjoy the win with this group. It’s a special group. Not just the players but the support staff that put in a lot of effort. Thanks to the families, including my mom and dad who are here.” South Africa skipper Sune Luus rued the loss of wickets at crucial junctures but was proud of the effort from her side.
“To play to this crowd with so many people watching and supporting, we never imagined. If you would have told me before the game that Australia would have scored 156, we would have taken it. We lost wickets at crucial times, they bowled well and we are proud of how we did. I don’t think it’s going backward.” She congratulated Australia for their outstanding show in the tournament.
“You guys are very annoying! But congratulations to Meg (Lanning) and the team. You are setting benchmark for other teams to live up to.” She said women’s cricket is on the upswing and will continue growing with time.

Inter title hopes fade with more misery in Bologna,"Simone Inzaghi's team are second in the standings on 47 points from 24 matches, 18 behind leaders Napoli who beat Empoli 2-0 on Saturday.","Inter Milan suffered a damaging 1-0 defeat at Bologna on Sunday which virtually ended their slim hopes of winning the Serie A title.
At the same ground where their title aspirations were dealt a fatal blow last season, Riccardo Orsolini’s goal condemned Inter to another loss.
Simone Inzaghi’s team are second in the standings on 47 points from 24 matches, 18 behind leaders Napoli who beat Empoli 2-0 on Saturday.
Inter will also be looking over their shoulders with concern at AC Milan and AS Roma, who are level on 44 points and are yet to play in this round of fixtures. Bologna are seventh on 35 points.
Bologna thought they had taken the lead at a rain-sodden Stadio Renato Dall’Ara through Musa Barrow in the 12th minute, only for the effort to be ruled out following a VAR review.
Minutes later, Roberto Soriano rattled the woodwork on the rebound after Andre Onana had parried Andrea Cambiaso’s volley into his path.
Inzaghi, missing Federico Dimarco, Milan Skriniar and Joaquin Correa through injury, rested Nicolo Barella among a raft of changes from their midweek Champions League win over Porto, and his much-changed Inter team lacked fluidity.

"Trained in tennis by father using YouTube clips, James McCabe eyes Top 100","The 19-year-old Australian, ranked 346th in the world, lost to senior compatriot James Duckworth in the Bengaluru Open semi-finals","James McCabe was not even three years old, but his father was convinced he could be a tennis player some day. There was something about the sight of the toddler swinging a tennis racquet that convinced Patrick that he was meant to be a professional tennis player.
“He just seemed to have an aptitude for tennis. He hit some forehands, and then backhands. He hit them really well, that too from the service line. It was crazy, actually. After that, I took him to the tennis court everyday for the next three-four years. We’d just hit balls. That’s how everything started,” recollects McCabe Sr, who is also James’ coach.
Patrick, who has never played the sport professionally himself, admits that he picked up the intricacies of the sport by watching clips on YouTube, which he would then pass on to his son.
“I didn’t know what I was doing (in the initial days). Not knowing a lot about teaching tennis, I strayed onto YouTube, where I sought out videos of tennis training for kids,” says McCabe Sr.
On Saturday, the 19-year-old McCabe, ranked 346th in the world, had his much senior compatriot James Duckworth, ranked 128th, fretting for a few brief moments in the semi-final of the Bengaluru Open Challenger. With the score at 3-3 in the second set, McCabe had a break point on Duckworth’s serve. But his inexperience came through and he let Duckworth claw out of the difficult situation, before the 31-year-old sealed a 6-3, 6-3 win to set up a final against Max Purcell.
McCabe was in the news last year for being Novak Djokovic’s training partner during the World No.1’s short stay in Australia. The Serb practised with McCabe in the days between him being sent to a detention hotel and being deported out of Australia for not being vaccinated against COVID-19.
While Djokovic never got to play the 2022 Australian Open, McCabe did get a wildcard in the qualifying tournament in 2022 and again this year.

For the McCabes, those training sessions with Djokovic and the wildcards are validation that their decision to take the plunge into tennis – despite McCabe also being a national champion in swimming when in school – was the right one.
The father also proudly points out that James was in a choir and can play various musical instruments, from the flute to the piano to the guitar.
But his focus now is on breaking into the Top 100 in the ATP rankings, and going from strength to strength from there. And then maybe someday, parents of three-year-olds will be watching his YouTube videos for inspiration.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/trained-in-tennis-by-father-using-youtube-clips-james-mccabe-eyes-top-100/,sports

"Ian Chappell slams Australian sweep ploy, says need to have good footwork","Citing the example of Indian skipper and opener Rohit Sharma, Chappell feels the key is to survive the first 10 minutes with a shade of luck on turning Indian tracks.","Former Australia captain Ian Chappell believes sweeping is the not only way to survive against spinners on Indian pitches, instead a batter needs to have good footwork to thrive against tweakers in sub-continent conditions.
Australia’s predetermined sweep ploy to tackle Indian spinners failed miserably as the hosts have won the first two Tests to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with two more matches left in the series.
“Sweeping regularly is not the answer to playing good spin bowling, and anyone who says so is talking through his hat,” Chappell wrote in his column for ESPNcricinfo.com.
“The odd player is very good at sweeping and should utilise the shot, but for the majority there are better ways. Any good spin bowler who makes the ball bounce is likely to expose the dangers in sweeping constantly.” Australia prepared on special scarified pitches in Sydney and chose not to play a single tour game in India for the gruelling month-long series.
“You don’t discover how to play good spin bowling later in life on a scarified Australian pitch just prior to a vital tour of India.
“You have to learn good footwork — coming three paces out of your crease or retreating quickly onto the back foot — at a young age,” he wrote.
The Australian legend feels Pat Cummins and Co erred in forming their batting strategy in the build up to the series.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It should have been obvious in Australia’s build-up what kinds of batting strategies needed to be used in India.
“The most beneficial are to watch the ball closely, more so than in Australia, and that there is a fraction more time than you think,” he wrote.
“Selectors can be fooled into thinking that playing spin bowling well in Australia automatically means success will follow on Indian pitches.
“That isn’t so but if the method in Australia is a sound one, selectors should assume it could lead to success in India.
“Once a batter understands about the extra time on slightly slower Indian pitches, he can work the ball into a gap to collect precious runs. Those runs, especially early in an innings, when survival is treacherous, can frustrate even the best spinners.” He also questioned Australia’s team’s selection in the first two Tests.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Australia’s selection on this tour has been awfully inconsistent and at times irrational. Getting selection right makes for an air of calm, which, along with effectively putting a stop to dressing-room tantrums, can aid team spirit,” Chappell opined.
“Like picking a well-balanced cricket team, good administrations should be a sensible combination of playing knowledge at the highest level along with sound business acumen so the game is well managed.
“The Australian cricket team is very good at many venues around the cricket world but alarm bells should have rung long ago about the trip to India.” Rohit Sharma showed the way
===================
Citing the example of Indian skipper and opener Rohit Sharma, Chappell feels the key is to survive the first 10 minutes with a shade of luck on turning Indian tracks.
“A successful player needs to quickly work out how to survive the first ten minutes on a typical Indian pitch that encourages spin, and hope he enjoys a share of luck.
ADVERTISEMENT
“If he plays sensibly, like Rohit Sharma has admirably shown during the series, batting isn’t impossible on testing Indian pitches,” the former Australian skipper wrote.
The 79-year-old went on to recall his approach to tackle spin in India.
“My perception of playing good spin bowling in India is ancient, based on experiences from more than five decades ago “Can those principles still work? If they are followed, and complemented by a common-sense approach, then bloody oath, they can.” “I was taught (not in the metric era): ‘If you’re stumped, make it by three yards not three inches.’ This was wonderful advice, followed by: ‘Don’t consider the wicketkeeper, because if you do, you’re thinking about missing the ball.'” “Armed with those suggestions and years of on-the-job training in all forms of cricket, I trusted my defence in India. If you don’t, as the current Australian team has demonstrated, you can easily be panicked into playing a rash shot,” he added.
Australia will face India in the third Test from Wednesday in Indore. The fourth and final Test is slated from March 9 in Ahmedabad.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ian-chappell-slams-australian-sweep-ploy-says-need-to-have-good-footwork-8467824/,sports

Cummins returned home to be with his ailing mother in Sydney after Australia crashed to their second successive defeat in the four-test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which India will retain having taken a 2-0 lead.
Warner also flew back after suffering a fracture to his elbow and a concussion in the second test in New Delhi, but all-rounder Green is fit again after shaking off a finger injury. Starc, who also suffered a finger injury, is set to return to action as well.
“They’re two world-class players and Pat’s our captain as well, so it’s definitely going to make it tougher… It’s going to be a big loss not having those two,” batter Handscomb said.
“But we’ve got all the information we need… We’ve got the training and the facilities that we need to be ready to go for Indore and Ahmedabad.
“Starc is coming back from injury and Green is coming back from injury. We’ve got a couple of big ins potentially, so there’s that exciting part as well.”

New Zealand frustrate England after Stokes enforces follow-on,"New Zealand were 202 for three in their second innings at stumps, needing only 24 runs to make England bat again at the Basin Reserve.","England snared three quick wickets with spin but New Zealand’s batters frustrated the tourists with their resistance on day three of the second test in Wellington on Sunday after Ben Stokes enforced the follow-on.
New Zealand were 202 for three in their second innings at stumps, needing only 24 runs to make England bat again at the Basin Reserve.
Kane Williamson (25 not out) and Henry Nicholls (18 not out) held firm after Jack Leach triggered a batting collapse that netted 3-18.
New Zealand resumed on 128 for no loss in their second innings after tea, with openers Tom Latham and Devon Conway pushing their partnership to 149 runs before Leach made the breakthrough.
The spinner found a thick inside edge which careened off Conway’s pad and looped over to short leg, where Ollie Pope dived forward to take the catch and remove the batter for 61.
The wicket shifted the momentum back to England, with Latham soon out lbw for 83 trying to sweep Joe Root.
Number four Will Young, selected for the match to add depth to the hosts’ batting, was bowled for eight by Leach, having managed two in the first innings.
ADVERTISEMENT
Young’s wicket left New Zealand 167 for three, still needing 59 runs to make England bat again.
Williamson and Nicholls rode their luck through the final hour but strode off unbeaten, with New Zealand having some hope of setting England a proper fourth innings chase.
New Zealand were earlier bowled out in the morning session for 209 in reply to England’s declared first innings total of 435 for eight, the Black Caps falling 27 runs short of avoiding the follow-on.
England skipper Stokes had little hesitation sending the hosts back in to bat on an overcast morning but Latham and Conway survived 19 watchful overs to lunch and then the entire middle session to tea.
ADVERTISEMENT
Latham brought up his 5,000th test run before tea with a single off James Anderson.
New Zealand started the day on 138 for seven in their first innings, still needing 98 runs to avoid the follow-on.
They briefly held hope of mowing the runs down as tail-ender captain Tim Southee went on a six-hitting spree in an entertaining knock of 73 off 49 balls.
Southee smashed Leach for three sixes in an over, the second bringing up his fifty from 39 deliveries and sending the ball onto scaffolding behind the fence at long-on.
ADVERTISEMENT
Leach dropped Southee when he slogged Stuart Broad to just in front of the fine leg rope when on 71.
But the spinner’s anguish lasted only one ball as Southee was caught by Zak Crawley at midwicket after another top edge.
That ended an excellent 98-run partnership with wicketkeeper Tom Blundell and the match quickly turned.
Blundell whacked Broad straight to Leach at mid-on to be out for 38 before the England paceman wrapped up the innings by dismissing a slogging Matt Henry for six.

Wayne Rooney supports Glazer rule; calls for possible new owners to take club forwards,"Rooney, who in 2010, tried to quit Manchester United saying that the club lacked ambition in the transfer market, has now come out backing the Glazer administration of the club, despite rampant fan protests.","Despite decades of fan opposition against the Glazer family’s ownership of Manchester United, former striker Wayne Rooney has come out in support of their rule as the club continues its search for new owners.
The support of the Glazers by Rooney comes in the face of intense backlash from fans over their rule that has seen a lack of player purchases at the right moments, a stagnation of the club’s training facilities, a long overdue renovation of the Old Trafford Stadium continuing to be pushed off but primarily the debt.
When the Glazers purchased Manchester United, they did so by taking on debt and then leveraged that debt onto the club. It has since been stopped by the English Football Association to be repeated for any other football club, but the debt has been a major factor in the lack of player acquisitions and the degrading of the facilities of the club.
“Firstly, I think the Glazers have done a fantastic job, they’ve been at the club for, well they signed me in 2004, so they’ve been at the club for 20 years now and I think they’ve always allowed managers to bring the players in they want,” said Rooney to ESPN.
Rooney also added that he knew the fands clearly wanted change and that the new owners of the club should be people who can take Manchester United forward.

This is not the ‘Aussie-Aussie’ kind of team… mentally they are very fragile: Harbhajan Singh,"The current team touring India don't have a plan and are clueless; the sweep shot was the worst option on a pitch like the one in Delhi, says Harbhajan Singh.","Calling them ‘clueless’ and bereft of any gameplan, former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has slammed the touring Australian side, saying it is ‘probably the weakest team’ to travel to India for a Test series.
Speaking at The Indian Express Idea Exchange, Harbhajan said the Australian teams of the past ‘understood the conditions better than the other teams that toured India’ and hence were a bit more successful.
“But… I think this is probably the weakest team. Not in terms of skills, mentally they are very fragile. They are not able to handle pressure the way the Aussies used to. It’ll be fair to say this is not the ‘Aussie-Aussie’ kind of a team that we all used to see or play against,” he said. “This team, particularly if we see now, they are clueless. They don’t have any plans.”

Australia have lost the opening two Tests of the four-match series without putting up a fight. The visitors lost the first Test in Nagpur by innings and 132 runs, inside three days. And while they were in the game while going into Day 3 of the second Test in New Delhi, Australia were bundled out cheaply once again as they suffered a six-wicket defeat. The result meant India retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
Harbhajan, one of the stars of the famous series win against Australia in 2001, criticised the strategy adopted by Pat Cummins-led, especially during the second Test, where six of their batsmen were dismissed attempting to play a sweep or reverse sweep. The sweep, he said, was the ‘worst option’ on a pitch like the one in Delhi where the bounce has always been low.

“The ball was staying low – again, this isn’t a new phenomenon. It’s been happening from the time since the stadium, which is now named after Arun Jaitley ji, was called Kotla. When the ball is keeping low, sweep is the worst option you can apply,” he said. “And out of the 10 wickets, seven fell to sweep shot and one batsman lost his back stump while trying to hit a reverse sweep.
So that shows there wasn’t any plan and the one they had wasn’t right. So this is the way the Australian team is thinking, this is probably the worst I have seen… there is no option or thinking as to what should be done.”

Australia arrived in India nearly two weeks before the first Test but instead of playing a practice game, they chose to train away from the public glare in Alur, the outskirts of Bengaluru. Anticipating that spin would play a decisive factor in the series, they also got an ‘Ashwin duplicate’ and had tailor-made practice pitches.
Read | Before becoming an MP, Harbhajan Singh consulted Sachin Tendulkar
Harbhajan wasn’t impressed with the idea, saying that with such actions they ‘hyped up’ the likes of Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja among themselves. The all-rounder duo has wreaked havoc in this series and has accounted for 31 wickets so far.
“Before the first Test even began, there was so much chaos. They were thinking about what will happen, will the pitches spin, they even got a bowler like Ashwin at nets. But when you bat at nets and you bat in the middle, those are two different things,” Harbhajan said. “So you’ve hyped up among yourselves about how Ashwin and Jadeja will bowl. So what! No matter how the pitch is, you should know how to manage the game. Know that 200-250 will be a good score… At least try to get that somehow. I couldn’t see any of this planning.”

He added that the Australians should have been better prepared for these conditions to at least put up a fight.

“They knew these conditions would be challenging for any batter – the ball will spin from the first ball. It’s not something that’s started to happen now; it’s been happening for the last 8-10 years.

"If the BCCI wants a player of stature as chief selector, then pay as much as head coach gets: Harbhajan Singh","A chief selector is currently paid Rs 1 crore, while head coach Rahul Dravid is reportedly paid over Rs 7 crore .","To have a former cricketer of stature as the chief national selector of the men’s team, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) must be willing to pay handsomely,” former India off-spinner Habhajan Singh said during an Idea Exchange session of The Indian Express.
With top former cricketers being on commentary panels of broadcasters, the chief selector’s role is not lucrative enough,” Harbhajan felt.
“A man with stature, one that has played the game quite often, will solve a lot of issues at the selector level. But why wouldn’t they take up the opportunity? I’ll give the example of Virender Sehwag. If you ask Virender Sehwag to become the chief selector, then the salary of that post needs to be analysed. I don’t know how much the chief selector in India earns, but if Sehwag is in commentary or in other businesses around cricket, then it’s likely he is earning more money. If you want Sehwag, a player with stature, for the chief selector’s job, then spending money has to be key. If you don’t spend money, then you will have to choose selectors from players who may have only played a year and might not be that big a name. If a man like Rahul Dravid is made the coach, then the chief selector must have the same stature as well – jiski awaaz mein dum ho, jiske wajood mein dum ho (whose voice and stature carry weight).

The chief selector of the senior men’s team is paid Rs 1 crore per annum and the other members of the selection panel Rs 90 lakhs, while head coach Rahul Dravid is reportedly paid over Rs 7 crore.
The current selection committee for the senior men’s team is without a chairman after former fast bowler Chetan Sharma was at the centre of a sting operation and subsequently resigned.
When asked if he would be open to being chief selector if offered the post, Harbhajan said that it depended on pay parity with the national coach.

“Let’s see. If things shape up moving forward, and coach and selector are equally paid, then why not? The job of the coach is to stay with the team and plan around the team. But team selection is also an equally important job.

Team India can have two coaches… bring in someone who understands the demands of T20: Harbhajan,"If Indian team can have two captains, then why not two coaches, asks Harbhajan Singh.","The men’s Indian cricket team should have two coaches with one appointed as a specialist T20 coach, former off-spinner Harbhajan Singh said. The Indian team has two captains with Rohit Sharma leading the side in Tests and One-day Internationals and Hardik Pandya in-charge of the T20 team following the team’s semifinal exit at the last T20 World Cup.
“Yes, you have two captains, so you can have two coaches. Why not? Someone whose planning is different. Like England has done with Brendon McCullum. Someone like Virender Sehwag or Ashish Nehra who worked with Gujarat Titans and Hardik Pandya won his first tournament (IPL) as captain. So, bring someone who understands the concept of T20 and demands of the game.
The coach knows that focus is on T20 cricket. Say if Ashish Nehra is the T20 coach, then he knows that his job is to make the Indian team champions in the T20 format, and Rahul Dravid knows he has to work on how the Indian team can be No.1 in Tests and ODIs,” Harbhajan said during an Idea Exchange session of The Indian Express.
Read | Before becoming an MP, Harbhajan Singh consulted Sachin Tendulkar
Harbhajan also said that with the talent at India’s disposal it is high time the team wins a major ICC title. When asked what he thinks is the reason India have not won a World Cup since 2011, Harbhajan said it boils down to the ability to handle pressure.
He also blamed too much of shuffling in the past for the team not being settled going into a World Cup.
“It has become a bit of a pattern. In 2018-19 we saw that there was a lot of shuffling of players. Dinesh Karthik was playing, Rishabh Pant was also playing. How to win a big match, there is a little lack of experience. Big matches are high pressure. World Cup pressure is different from bilateral series. Bigger the tournament, the higher the pressure is. Very few people actually take that kind of pressure. We used to say that if Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli make runs, then India will win. But now there is Hardik Pandya. We have more players now (potential match-winners) and I hope this trend will change. With the kind of talent we have, I think we should be able to. If you are unable to win with the talent we have, then when will you win?
With this year’s 50-over World Cup to be hosted in India, Harbhajan said the home team needs to play with the right kind of intent in order to be successful.

"Before becoming an MP, Harbhajan Singh consulted Sachin Tendulkar",Sachin Tendulkar told Harbhajan Singh that he should commit to being an MP only if he is sure about devoting enough time.,"Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who is a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament nominated by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said that he had consulted his close friend and batting legend Sachin Tendulkar before joining politics. Tendulkar also had a term as a Rajya Sabha MP starting 2012.
“I have the most respect for Paaji (Tendulkar). He has made me feel so comfortable. We became very close because there was that comfort and I think he enjoyed my company as well. Then I started speaking in Punjabi to him and we both used to enjoy talking to each other. If I ever need advice, I always go to him. Even before joining the Rajya Sabha, I talked to him. He told me that I was getting an opportunity to serve my country and that I should only commit if I could give the job time. I thought that was good advice. Now this is my new innings – I don’t know how long it will go, just that I do it well,” Harbhajan Singh said during an Idea Exchange session with The Indian Express.

Talking about the switch from cricket to politics, Harbhajan said his innings in parliament is a learning experience.
“It’s an altogether different field for me. I have spent 20-odd years in cricket and enjoyed every bit of it. Today, whatever I am is because of the game. Even the reason why I was given the MP seat is because I am Harbhajan Singh, the cricketer. I am still very new, very raw in politics and trying to know how things work. Being at Parliament sessions, meeting the big people of our country, the decision-makers is an experience, sharing my knowledge, getting to know their mind in a lot of different aspects of life and what is happening in India is obviously a big learning. The more time I spend in it, the more I am trying to learn from different people. I try to keep as much track as I can of these political agendas, what is happening in India and try to raise the same issues in Parliament and also what is happening recently in Delhi with mayor and stuff and BJP and AAP,” Harbhajan said.
When asked about the clashes in the MCD House after the mayor election, Harbhajan said ‘it was not the right thing to do’. The Aam Aadmi Party’s Shelly Oberoi was elected as the mayor of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on Wednesday.

January signing Leandro Trossard arrowed a stunning strike into the net midway through the first half, but the Belgian was denied his second goal for Arsenal after VAR ruled Ben White to have fouled goalkeeper Danny Ward in the build up.
It took the dominant visitors until the first minute of the second half to break the deadlock as Martinelli raced onto a Trossard pass and stroked home what proved to be the winner.
The hosts did not look like getting back into the contest, with Arsenal seeing out the win that stretches their lead over Manchester City, who play at Bournemouth later on Saturday. Leicester stay 14th, three points clear of the relegation zone.

With the title race twisting and turning each week, Arsenal travelled north to Leicester fully anticipating a tough match against a side who thrashed Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 in their previous home match.
The hosts, without the influential James Maddison in midfield due to illness, never really got going, however, and failed to muster a shot on target in the match.
The visitors did not have to overly exert themselves to get the job done. Trossard was unlucky in the first half — he will not hit many better strikes all season.
Martinelli’s finish was equally impressive on the run. No Arsenal player has more league goals than the Brazilian this season.

The result could have been more comfortable, with Arsenal having the ball in the net again only for it to be ruled out for offside, but they had no trouble seeing out the victory to keep them on course for a first league title in 19 years.
Arsenal have now won 10 of their 13 away league games this season, one more than in the whole of last term. It is the fastest they have reached 10 away wins in any league campaign.
Meanwhile, New Leeds United manager Javi Gracia’s reign began with a 1-0 Premier League home victory over bottom club Southampton as Junior Firpo’s goal helped the Yorkshire club to snap a 10-game winless run and move out of the relegation zone on Saturday.
Leeds jumped to 17th on 22 points after 24 games, a point above the drop zone, following a first league win since before the World Cup break.

The hosts dominated possession in Gracia’s first game since his appointment this week and edged a scrappy first half in which neither side created much of note.
Firpo finally broke the deadlock in front of a raucous Elland Road in the 77th minute, squeezing a tame effort under Gavin Bazunu after being cleverly set up with a flick by Jack Harrison.

Southampton piled on the pressure as they desperately searched for an equaliser, and dead-ball specialist James Ward-Prowse nearly created one as he whipped in a corner in 90th minute, but he was let down by a poor header from team mate Armel Bella-Kotchap.
Southampton, who will have thought their luck was turning after taking three points at Chelsea last week, remain 20th — three points behind second-from-bottom Bournemouth, who host Manchester City later on Saturday.
While Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins scored a penalty and Emiliano Buendia added a second goal as they beat Everton 2-0 in a frenetic Premier League encounter at Goodison Park on Saturday to leave the home side in the bottom three.

Despite dominating the game for long spells, Everton could not fashion a goal and are now 18th in the table on 21 points, above Bournemouth on goal difference, while Villa are 11th on 31 points.
The best chance of a high-energy first half fell to Everton, with Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez forced into a superb reflex save to deny Amadu Onana’s header in the 34th minute.
With Villa pinned back in their own half and struggling to pass the ball out from the back, Everton went even closer in the 54th minute as Tyrone Mings was forced to clear the ball off the line after a goal-mouth scramble.

Villa made a rare foray forward in the 59th minute and Watkins went close with a header but Jordan Pickford showed why Everton awarded him a new four-and-a-half-year contract this week by pulling off a superb save.
There was little he could do two minutes later when Villa were awarded a penalty in the 61st minute after John McGinn was upended in the box by Idrissa Gueye and referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot.
Watkins stepped up and smashed the spot kick down the middle and past Pickford to give his side a lead that was scarcely deserved.

Everton substitute Ellis Simms hooked a volley over the bar in the 77th minute but things went from bad to worse for the home side when they were punished by Buendia for committing too many players forward.
McGinn broke through the middle and angled a pass to Buendia who lashed a shot inside the near post in the 81st minute to double Villa’s advantage.
That took the wind out of the sails of the Toffees and Villa were able to contain them as they held on to secure all three points.
Watkins set a club record for Aston Villa by scoring for the fifth Premier League game in a row, and he was delighted with how his side weathered the storm and set him up to succeed from the spot.

Most of the Torch Bearers' forward moves were limited to counterattacking ones as ATKMB kept control of the possession.,"ATK Mohun Bagan produced a dominant 2-0 win against East Bengal FC here on Saturday to extend Kolkata derby winning streak to six matches in the Indian Super League. It also confirmed a third-place finish for the Mariners in their final league game of the season.
It was ATKMB who were ahead for much of the first-half.
The opening five minutes involved a lot of attacking moves on their part, although none resulted in any substantial scoring opportunities. Pritam Kotal came closest when a ball was chipped to him at the far post after a corner, but the defender sent his volley over the bar.
East Bengal’s first shot on goal was a long-range effort from Suhair VP that Vishal Kaith gathered with ease. Most of the Torch Bearers’ forward moves were limited to counterattacking ones as ATKMB kept control of the possession.
By the middle of the first half, there were pacey crosses in either direction, with robust challenges also coming into the fray which would result in three yellow cards before the half-time whistle.

The second half began similarly to the first, and Petratos was given space to break the deadlock just as the packed spectators held up their flashlights in the 52nd minute.
Ashique Kuruniyan slid the striker through on the left side of the box and he took a moment before striking across the face of the goal with his left foot, only to hit the upright.
But ATKMB would eventually get into the lead. After a series of back-to-back corners that East Bengal FC were able to stave away, centre-back Slavko Damjanovic managed to put the Mariners in front in the 68th minute.

The corner was aimed at Manvir Singh at the near post, whose clever flick bounced over the defensive wall and towards Damjanovic’s head. The defender’s glance bounced off the upright before he helped into goal as it trickled back towards him.

The match continued to keep its high pace, but once again, neither team was presented with anything more than half-chances.
Kuruniyan’s trickery down the left allowed him to cut in at one point, but his right-footed effort was fired over the goal.
At the other end, East Bengal FC were industrious, but were unable to break into the box with regularity.
Their commitment to the equaliser eventually meant two big chances in the span of seconds for ATKMB, and Petratos was on hand to seal the derby for them.

Substitute Kiyan Nassiri was played through in front of goal, but Kamaljit parried his shot; unfortunately for the goalkeeper, it fell straight into Petratos’ path and the striker tapped it in to seal third place for ATKMB.
Their third place finish means ATKMB will stay in Kolkata for their first playoff fixture. The loss for East Bengal FC meant they finished the season in 10th place.

"Red Bull look very strong, says Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc","Leclerc was runner-up last year to Red Bull's double world champion Max Verstappen, and the pair will be renewing their rivalry when the season starts in Bahrain next week.","Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc topped the morning timesheets on the final day of Formula One’s pre-season test in Bahrain on Saturday but said Red Bull remained the team to beat.
The Monegasque lapped the Sakhir circuit with a fastest time of one minute 31.024 seconds on the Pirelli C4 tyres, 0.418 quicker than Mercedes’ George Russell who was using the softer C5 rubber.
“I feel we’ve got some work to do,” Leclerc told reporters after handing over to team mate Carlos Sainz for the final session.
“Red Bull seems to be very strong in these three days.”
Leclerc was runner-up last year to Red Bull’s double world champion Max Verstappen, and the pair will be renewing their rivalry when the season starts in Bahrain next week.
The Ferrari driver said he felt in the best shape of his life after some extreme winter training in the Dolomites, and was fully recharged.
Ferrari started last year strongly, with Leclerc winning two of the first three races, before the challenge petered out in strategic errors, poor reliability and driver mistakes.
Mattia Binotto has left as principal since then, replaced by Frenchman Fred Vasseur whose task is to deliver the team’s first championship since the constructors’ title in 2008.
ADVERTISEMENT
Red Bull won 17 of 22 races last year, Verstappen triumphant in 15 of them.
Leclerc said the new SF-23 car was a very different one to last year’s.
“I’ve been trying a lot of different driving styles. I seem to have found my way a little bit this morning, finally,” he said.
“I expect us to be a bit quicker in the straights, maybe struggling a little bit more in the corners,” he added.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We are still working quite a bit on trying to find the sweet spot of the car in terms of setup so I hope there’s some margin on that still, that we haven’t found the sweet spot yet.”
Verstappen, who was quickest in both sessions on Thursday and second on Friday evening, told reporters he was happy with his car even if it remained a work in progress.
“It’s been very good. I think the car’s working really well. Just going through a lot of things we wanted to try and it’s very interesting what we have been trying.

"F1 tyre blanket ban would be dangerous, says Lewis Hamilton",The governing FIA said this week that new wet weather tyres that did not need blankets would be introduced from Imola in May.,"Banning tyre blankets in Formula One from 2024 would be dangerous and a pointless exercise, seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton said on Saturday.
The warmers provide immediate grip and performance but getting rid of them appeals for reasons of cost and sustainability.
The governing FIA said this week that new wet weather tyres that did not need blankets would be introduced from Imola in May.
Pirelli’s F1 head Mario Isola told motorsport.com during testing in Bahrain that plans to ban blankets entirely next year could be put to a vote after tests following the British Grand Prix in July.
Mercedes driver Hamilton told reporters the sport could be making a wrong move.
“I think it’s dangerous,” said the Briton.
“I’ve tested the no-blankets and there’s going to be an incident at some stage. So on a safety factor I think it’s the wrong decision.
“Also you have to drive multiple laps to get the tyres to work and the whole argument is that taking away the blankets is for going more sustainable, more green. In actual fact we’re just using more fuel to get temperature into tyres.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Hamilton said a car with unheated tyres would be very twitchy, skating around on the surface.
“If there is someone else who is on tyres that are working, you could easily collide with them,” added Hamilton. “It’s a pointless exercise.”

Be it landing in India without fully fit players, benching an inform player, sending home a spinner they had initially trusted, batsmen surrendering meekly without a fight, being spooked by how the pitch is going to behave, playing just one pacer – when fast-bowling has been their strongest suit. The list may get longer in Indore and Ahmedabad, the venues for the third and fourth Test matches. These are the sort of characteristics one never got to see from past Australian teams.

Leave alone the 2001 and 2004 touring Australian teams which had more than a handful of match-winners, even in 2008 and 2010, they were hard to dislodge. In those tours, they arrived here with a pace unit that is inferior to the current one, but Ricky Ponting ensured India had to earn each run they scored and each wicket they picked up.

South Africa hope pace bowling attack can subdue Australia,"South Africa will be outright underdogs against the five-time champions, despite having a strong bowling lineup and the homeground advantage at what is likely to be a sold-out Newlands in Cape Town.","Whatever the result in Sunday’s Women’s Twenty20 World Cup final against powerhouse Australia, South Africa captain Sune Luus says the team already feel like winners having become the first side from the country to reach a global final.
South Africa will be outright underdogs against the five-time champions, despite having a strong bowling lineup and the homeground advantage at what is likely to be a sold-out Newlands in Cape Town.
But having stunned England in a tense semi-final on Friday, Luus believes they laid down a marker for women’s cricket in the country from which they can grow.
“We are achieving our goals, we wanted to inspire a nation and put women’s cricket on the map, to get young boys and girls to pick up a bat and ball. Hopefully tomorrow is just another step in that,” Luus told reporters on Saturday.

“We never thought people in our country would stand in long queues to buy tickets for a women’s cricket match. It is something special. I hope once this World Cup is finished, that will stay the same.
“There are a lot of good things to come out of this tournament. If people don’t take women’s cricket seriously by now, then there is no hope.”
South Africa had been to five previous World Cup semi-finals across all formats without success, but now stand on the brink of a career-defining moment for what is largely a young group of players.
Luus said that in the final staying focused and not letting the occasion get to them would be crucial.

“We have always known we have the ability to be in the final, it was just to break the semi-final curse,” she says.
“For us it is to stay calm and focus on what we do best. We need to trust our skills and abilities.”
South Africa have lost all six previous T20 meetings with Australia, including a six-wicket defeat in the pool stages of this competition when they clashed in Gqeberha.
“We were 20-30 runs short in that game,” Luus says. “Australia bat extremely deep. Whether we bat or bowl first, we have to put up a big fight, we have to take it as deep as possible.

Richa lone Indian in Women’s T20 WC Player of Tournament shortlist,India made a semifinal exit with a heartbreaking five-run loss against five-time champions Australia in Cape Town on Thursday. The 19-year-old's shone in her role as a finisher in South Africa.,"Young wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh was the lone Indian among nine players shortlisted for the Women’s T20 World Cup Player of the Tournament.
India made a semifinal exit with a heartbreaking five-run loss against five-time champions Australia in Cape Town on Thursday. The 19-year-old’s shone in her role as a finisher in South Africa. She smashed two scores in the 40s including an unbeaten 47 against England that took her side to within sight of victory.
Richa was only dismissed twice from five innings at the tournament and scored at a strike-rate greater than 130 that further displayed her attacking prowess.
Overall she finished with 168 runs at an average of 68. Behind the stumps also she impressed with her agility and took a screamer to dismiss English opener Danni Wyatt.
Players from Australia dominate the ICC shortlist with three from the reigning champions, followed by two from England and South Africa. India and the West Indies have one each.
Skipper Meg Lanning (139 runs, average 69.50), wicket-keeper batter Alyssa Healy (171 runs, average 57) and all-rounder Ash Gardner (81 runs and nine wickets) were the Australians in the list.
All-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt (216 runs. average 72) and spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who finished with 11 wickets with a tidy economy of 4.15 were picked from England.

The two from South Africa were Laura, Wolvaardt, who played a key role in taking the team to the final, and opener Tazmin Brits.
Brits saved her best performance for when it mattered most with a stylish 68 against England in the semi-final on Friday.

Australia punched themselves in mouth long before first ball was bowled: Greg Chappell,"Australia have already conceded the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after being hammered in the first two Tests of the four-match series, both games ending under three days and prompting sharp reactions from the country's former cricketers.","Citing Mike Tyson, Australian great Greg Chappell has slammed the team’s forgettable performance in the first two Tests against India, saying the visitors “punched themselves in the mouth long before the first ball was even bowled”.
Australia have already conceded the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after being hammered in the first two Tests of the four-match series, both games ending under three days and prompting sharp reactions from the country’s former cricketers.
“It was Mike Tyson who said in the lead-up to a fight with Evander Holyfield: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.
“My concern after watching the first two Tests is that the Australian team punched themselves in the mouth long before the first ball was even bowled,” Chappell wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
He has also questioned Australia’s planning for the ongoing tour of the country.
“It is one thing to plan, but to base that plan on a flawed premise is an exercise in futility,” he added.
Beaten by an innings and 132 runs in Nagpur, Australia opted to go in with only one pacer in Delhi — skipper Pat Cummins. They dropped Scott Boland and handed debut to left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann.

“Australia needed to play to their strengths to have a chance of winning this series. Spin bowling is not our strength. Picking spinners for the sake of it is not the way to success in India.
“We had to pick our best bowlers and trust them to do the job and back that with sensible batting, based on sound principles.” He said leaving out Boland for an extra spinner was a mistake.
“That Cummins under-bowled himself and failed to use the short ball on a wicket of variable bounce was another mistake. To complete the trifecta, it seems that no one saw fit to tell Cummins that he was under-bowling and that he should use the short ball.” Chappell also gave his views on the Australian batters’ overreliance on the sweep shots — which led to their downfall — in the second innings of the Delhi Test.
“Adding it to your repertoire in spinning conditions can be sensible, but not if it is the only option. There are other shots that are less risky and likely to be more profitable but, because the sweep for most batsmen has to be pre-meditated, the other options invariably fall by the wayside.
ADVERTISEMENT
“One of the first things to learn about batting in Indian conditions is that you have more time than you realise. The main goal should be to survive the first couple of overs and rotate the strike. If you can survive that, then batting no longer seems as challenging as Fermat’s Last Theorem.”
India won the second Test in Delhi by six wickets despite Australia having their nose ahead at one stage of the game. The visitors reduced India to 139 for seven in their first innings but a 114-run partnership between Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel rescued the hosts.
Then, in their second innings, Australia were going along nicely before committing a harakiri on the third morning.
“What can Australia do from here? Firstly, pick their best team and then play with the passion, tenacity and grit which is our hallmark. Australian fans know that it is tough in India.

“They can accept getting beaten by a better side, but they won’t cop seeing an Australian team playing recklessly and bowled out in a session or two and turning its toes up inside three days. There is red-hot anger, bewilderment and embarrassment in our fans,” Chappell said.

‘Invincible’ Australia stand between South Africa and their fairytale,"South Africa showed commendable fighting spirit to upset England in the semifinal but they will need to stitch together a perfect game to topple the mighty Australia, who are the record five-time champions and are in their seventh successive final.","South Africa will get their fairytale finish at home if they find a way to halt the Australian juggernaut in the Women’s T20 World Cup final here on Sunday.
South Africa showed commendable fighting spirit to upset England in the semifinal but they will need to stitch together a perfect game to topple the mighty Australia, who are the record five-time champions and are in their seventh successive final.
South Africa have made rapid strides over the past 12 months and after making the semifinals of the ODI World Cup last year, they entered their maiden final of an ICC event here on Friday.
In Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits, a former world junior javelin champion whose Olympic dream was shattered in 2012 due to a car accident, South Africa have one of the best opening pairings in the tournament. They both go into the final in top form and are vital to the team’s chances against Australia who managed to beat India in the semifinals despite not playing their best game.
All-rounder Marizanne Kapp is another important player for South Africa and produced a much needed cameo in the semis. Skipper Sune Luus thinks she has the world’s best bowling attack at her disposal and why not when you have the express pace duo of Shabnam Ismail and Ayabonga Khaka in your ranks.
The crowd will be fully behind South Africa and the home team will look to feed off them like they did on Friday. Australia had comfortably beaten South Africa in the group stage but they will be wary of them in the title clash.
Australia, who by far have been the most successful side in women’s cricket history, look good to extend their dominance. They have all bases covered and no total is safe when they are chasing. India needed only 39 off the last five overs but Australia did not give up and gave their 100 per cent on the field to wrest the game in their favour.
ADVERTISEMENT
Champion outfits find a way of winning even when things are not going their way and the Meg Lanning-led side is known for that.
South African opener Britz was asked about Australia’s undisputed rule over the game after the famous win over England on Friday.
“I’m a bit too straight forward, so I’m trying to work on that because I like to say things as they come – but the end of the day cricket is a very funny game and Australia might be the top but at the end of the day, you play the ball you don’t play the players, and I think that’s what we did in this England side.
“We didn’t play England that we always lost to and it’s a constant reminder that I heard I was never in that. You know the semi-finals when they lost is the first semi-final I’ve ever been in and the first time against England so we’ll take it as it comes but very excited to go to the final,” said the opener.

‘Wow I need someone to teach me that’: Peter Handscomb recalls chat with Ajinkya Rahane over countering spin in India,"During the IPL in 2016, Handscomb shared the dressing room with Rahane. The two had a chat were the Indian spoke about how to use the feet and wrist to open up the leg side while playing spinners.","Australia’s middle-order batter Peter Handscomb has recalled how former India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane helped him combat spin bowling in the sub-continent.
During the IPL in 2016, Handscomb shared the dressing room with Rahane. The two had a chat were the Indian spoke about how to use the feet and wrist to open up the leg side while playing spinners.
“He was playing these shots off his back foot through midwicket which I thought were ridiculous,” Handscomb told Sydney Morning Herald.
“I was like, wow I need someone to teach me that. So we spoke about getting his front leg out of the way and being able to manipulate the ball from there.
“That helps your back foot become a scoring zone, and then if they overpitch, you can hopefully score off the front foot as well. Then all their good balls you just find a way to defend.” After scoring an unbeaten 72 off 142 balls in the first innings, Handscomb, like many of his teammates, got out for a duck while attempting a sweep shot in the second essay of the second Test at Kotla.
“India personally outplayed me in that situation. They gave me my scoring gap, but without the reward, so it was just going to be a single, but tempted me to hit the ball there.
“And I fell for that and tried to manipulate the ball there when, had that been my third ball of the first innings, I would have just tried to defend, because I was still trying to understand the pitch and what was going on.
ADVERTISEMENT
“For me, it’s just about being stronger and starting again. I probably walked out there thinking ‘I’m still on 72 not out, I can just pick up where I left off’, and you can’t think like that.”
Handscomb, who has been to India about eight times including when he was an academy scholar, feels tours are important in getting the hang of the conditions in the sub- continent.
“I’d have sessions where no matter what the bowler was bowling, I had to hit every ball on the leg side, and then the next day and every ball had to go on the off side, and every ball had to be played off the back foot, or every ball off the front foot,” he says.
“It was learning what I could and couldn’t do in subcontinent tours with no repercussions. I get to try all this. It’s just so different to back home, where bounce is key for spin. So tours are crucial.” Despite conceding the Broder Gavskar Trophy after losing the first two Tests, Handscomb said the Australian camp is positive.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The feeling around the group is one of trust in each other’s games, which is very hard to come by. We’ll definitely take the positives out of Delhi.
“We still had a first innings lead, we’d done well there, we’d started well in the second innings and then it all just happened really fast and we didn’t stop it at any stage.
“The challenge is if there’s a moment where we have lost two or three quick ones, it’s being able to stop the flow for a second and let us all just take a step back, have a breath and then continue on with the game, and hopefully stem the flow of wickets that way.” As a good player of spin bowling, Handscomb was always in line to be a part of the India tour but the batter wants to be “on every Australian tour from now”.

The response from the Pakistan skipper reminded everyone of Rohit’s response where he said, “Agar main Pakistan ka coach bana to main bataunga, abhi kya bataunga (If I become the coach of Pakistan, I can tell. What will I say now),” replied Rohit with a big smile when he asked about how Pakistan batters can improve.

UEFA opens probe after Sevilla keeper attacked by fan on pitch,"The match was halted in the closing stages after a supporter ran onto the pitch and assaulted Dmitrovic, punching him in the face before being wrestled to the ground by the Serbian.","European soccer’s governing body UEFA has opened an investigation after Sevilla goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic was attacked by a fan on the pitch in Thursday’s Europa League match at PSV Eindhoven, The Athletic sports website reported.
The match was halted in the closing stages after a supporter ran onto the pitch and assaulted Dmitrovic, punching him in the face before being wrestled to the ground by the Serbian.
Players and staff from both teams gathered around Dmitrovic and the pitch invader before stewards intervened and took the invader off the field.
Sevilla lost the knockout stage playoff 2-0 but still advanced to the next round with an aggregate score of 3-2.
UEFA did not release a statement but The Athletic said the governing body confirmed to the website on Friday that a case had been opened following the incident.
Reuters has asked UEFA for comment.
Dmitrovic, who had a red bruise on his neck after the incident, urged UEFA to intervene.
“I have never seen anything like it,” Dmitrovic told Movistar Plus after the game. “I’ll keep my mouth shut so I don’t say what I would really like to do in that moment.

New Zealand vs England: Joe Root shrugs off identity crisis with unbeaten century,Root was 153 not out when Stokes declared England's first innings closed at an imposing 435 for eight.,"Only days after admitting to something of an identity crisis in Ben Stokes’ England setup, former captain Joe Root can now rest easy after a brilliant, unbeaten century in the second test against New Zealand.
Having shared in a 302-run stand with fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook, Root went on with the job after the dynamic rookie was dismissed for 186 early on day two at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.
Root was 153 not out when Stokes declared England’s first innings closed at an imposing 435 for eight.

England have won 10 of their past 11 tests since Stokes replaced Root as captain and are on target for another victory after New Zealand collapsed to be 138 for seven, with rain halting play early on day two.
Root helped kick off England’s sparkling run under Stokes by scoring a mountain of runs against New Zealand and India in the home summer.
However, he feared he was not pulling his weight after a relatively lean run against South Africa and away to Pakistan.
“I’ve just got to find out what sits best for me and it’s going to take some time,” Root said after scoring 14 and 57 in the first test win over New Zealand at Mount Maunganui.
“If I’m being brutally honest, there was the initial relief of coming out of the captaincy and now I’m just trying to find out what my role is within this team.”

It was a surprising comment coming from one of England’s greatest batsmen after his 128th test.
Yet, such are the standards of the 32-year-old Yorkshireman, invariably his own harshest critic.
England’s attacking ‘Bazball’ revolution under Stokes and head coach Brendon ‘Baz’ McCullum has been a game-changer for both the team and the format.
Root may have wondered how he fit in the new paradigm.

While by no means a plodding batsman, he is unlikely to ever be described ‘swashbuckling’ like some of his harder hitting team mates.
Such concerns may no longer bother him, though, after his majestic 224-ball knock featuring 10 fours and three sixes at the Basin Reserve on Saturday.
“I might not have explained it exactly as I’d like to the other day,” he told reporters.
“I kind of know I have a very good understanding of what my role is.

“But I felt like in that situation (today), I found a very good tempo to manage those conditions.”
Root was dismissed in the first test with a botched reverse ramp, a shot that seemed out of character.
Yet in Wellington he has used it to great effect, hitting a six off Tim Southee early in the morning and then another four off the paceman-captain to push England past 400.

He will take on Nicolas Jarry, who topped Sebastian Baez 6-3, 7-6 (3).","A rematch is in sight for Carlos Alcaraz and Cameron Norrie in the Rio Open final. Both advanced to the semifinals of the clay-court tournament on Friday and could repeat last weekend’s Argentina Open decider, which the Spaniard won.
Defending Rio Open champion Alcaraz beat Dusan Lajovic 6-4, 7-6 (0). He will take on Nicolas Jarry, who topped Sebastian Baez 6-3, 7-6 (3).
The Chilean was suspended for doping for 11 months in 2020 and is trying climb back in the rankings since February of last year. His best ranking was No. 38, but today he is now No. 139.
Once again, the 19-year-old Alcaraz did not play his best tennis in Brazil, as in his first two matches, but still prevailed. Unforced errors, difficulties with the first service and less energy than the usual were evident throughout the Spaniard’s match against Lajovic.
Alcaraz, who won last year’s U.S. Open for his first major, is playing his second tournament since a right leg injury that sidelined him for four months.
Alcaraz and Jarry have never played each other in a tour match.

New Zealand vs England: Joe Root shines before New Zealand collapse in second test,"New Zealand were 138 for seven when showers fell midway through the last session at Basin Reserve and forced play to be halted for the day, still 297 runs short of England's declared first innings total of 435 for eight.","An unbeaten Joe Root century and a bowling masterclass by James Anderson put England in complete control of the second test on Saturday, as New Zealand’s hopes of levelling the series plunged with shambolic batting on a rain-hit day two.
New Zealand were 138 for seven when showers fell midway through the last session at Basin Reserve and forced play to be halted for the day, still 297 runs short of England’s declared first innings total of 435 for eight.
Though Harry Brook (186) was denied a double-century in a 302-run stand with Root, the former England skipper marched on to an unbeaten 153.
Ben Stokes’ declaration paid immediate dividends as Anderson, the world’s top-ranked test bowler at the age of 40, scythed through New Zealand’s top order with three quick wickets.
Spinner Jack Leach grabbed another three and Stuart Broad one victim, leaving wicketkeeper Tom Blundell (25 not out) and tail-ender captain Tim Southee (23 not out) with an improbable rescue mission.
“I just think it was a brilliant call, personally, from him,” Root said of Stokes’ declaration. “We might not be sat here with them seven down tonight, so credit to him.”
Though New Zealand were thrashed by 267 runs in the series-opener in Mount Maunganui, they have plumbed new depths in the nation’s capital, leaving home fans in the sold-out crowds dismayed.

Their bowlers were humiliated by Brook and Root on day one, and their batsmen crumbled meekly on day two.
Five of them fell due to poor shot selection, including Kane Williamson who was caught behind off Anderson for four with a loose shot.
Anderson has now dismissed New Zealand’s top batsman nine times.
“It’s been disappointing,” New Zealand batting coach Luke Ronchi told reporters.
“Because I think guys are sort of struggling with … the trust element of things.
ADVERTISEMENT
“But that’s the message that we’re going to keep giving them, is to trust their skills.”
ONE-HANDED CATCHES
Opener Tom Latham (35) and number five Henry Nicholls (30) made starts but both fell trying to reverse-sweep Leach.
Number six Daryl Mitchell was out for 13 off Leach’s last ball before tea.
Ollie Pope took a brilliant, one-handed catch at silly point to remove the all-rounder but Mitchell was culpable for hitting in the air off the face of the bat.
ADVERTISEMENT
It was Pope’s second one-hander, having taken the first with his left after a sweeping Nicholls top-edged into his own elbow, with the ball pinging over his shoulder to the fielder.
All-rounder Michael Bracewell later spooned a catch straight back to Broad to be out for six.
Only opener Devon Conway (0) and number four Will Young (2) might feel at peace with their dismissals, both beaten by good balls from Anderson that caught thin edges on the way to wicketkeeper Ben Foakes.
England’s batters also threw away wickets on day one but it was of no consequence due to Root and Brook’s contributions.
The tourists started the day at 315 for three, with the Yorkshire duo looking to carry on.
ADVERTISEMENT
Recalled New Zealand paceman Matt Henry ended their epic stand when Brook hit a return catch to the bowler but Stokes kept up the pressure with a quickfire 27 before he was caught slogging Neil Wagner to mid-off.
England lost 3-27 in that phase, with Bracewell trapping both Foakes (0) and Stuart Broad (14) lbw.
Root stayed firm, though, as his batting partners dwindled, thrashing the New Zealand bowlers for 10 fours and three sixes in his 224-ball knock.

The incident occurred when New Zealand were 96-5 and Ben Stokes brought in left-arm spinner Jack Leach to take the ball. Mitchell who was 13 at the time defended the ball solidly stretching forward, however, to his surprise Pope around the bat took the catch in flash. The batter looked stunned at the effort.

Man United’s ‘too small’ Martinez has silenced his critics,"In a matter of months, however, the World Cup winner from Argentina has established himself as a bedrock of United's four-pronged trophy challenge and become one of the most dominant defenders in the English Premier League.","It took only two games for some to question whether Lisandro Martinez could make it at Manchester United.
In a matter of months, however, the World Cup winner from Argentina has established himself as a bedrock of United’s four-pronged trophy challenge and become one of the most dominant defenders in the English Premier League.
“In the beginning, in Argentina, it was the same (to doubt),” Martinez said. “But it’s normal because, in football, it’s not normal to play as a center back with my height.” At 5-foot-9 (1.75 meters), he was dismissed as too small to play center back in the league and United’s shocking 4-0 loss to Brentford in August was evidence to some that he was out of his depth.
Jamie Carragher, a former Liverpool center back who is a television commentator, described the Argentine’s height as a “huge problem” for United manager Erik ten Hag.
“I can’t control that. It’s just an opinion,” Martinez said. “I understand when people say that, they show me who they are. It’s not my problem.” United paid almost $58 million to sign Martinez from Ajax last year, after Ten Hag identified him as a key part of his rebuild at Old Trafford. The pair worked together for three years at the Dutch club and Martinez’s ability to play out from the back with his left foot was considered vital to the new manager’s plans.
Focus, however, was on his height, rather than his ball skills after United’s back-to-back losses in the opening two games of the league, including the humiliation at Brentford.
Martinez was not only a target for opposition players, but critics as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It was tough, for sure, because it was not the start that we wanted,” he said. “It was hard, the result, the way that we lose, the attitude was really bad.
“The team, we changed directly the mentality. It was like, OK, we are in the ground, but now we have to prove, to fight again. Sometimes it is good to see the bad things and then you have to change on the pitch.” Few would have expected United to still be in contention on four fronts after such a troubled start.
On Thursday, United knocked out Barcelona from the Europa League with a 2-1 win at Old Trafford. On Sunday, the team can win the first trophy of the season when it plays Newcastle in the English League Cup final at Wembley Stadium.
A Premier League title challenge is also on for third-placed United, and the team is in the FA Cup fifth round.

While Ten Hag values Martinez’s technical qualities, his fighting spirit has seen him become a favorite among fans.

“Argentine players are always like this, we are passionate,” Martinez said. “Football for us is like everything so that is why we always give everything of us.

"Barring one session in Delhi, Australia have been outstanding: Maxwell",Australia lost nine wickets for 52 runs in their second innings to squander the slight advantage they had at the start of day three.,"Glenn Maxwell feels Australia were “outstanding” in the first two Tests against India barring the one self-destructing session in Delhi on day three.
Australia lost nine wickets for 52 runs in their second innings to squander the slight advantage they had at the start of day three.
“I think they’ve showed a lot of fight. Bar that one session I thought they were outstanding. It’s bloody difficult over there – it’s not an easy place to play, it’s so foreign for us.
“But I feel like, apart from a couple of little moments, we’ve been in the fight, we’ve been matching India at different times and they’ve shown a lot of fight,” he was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald.
Among the current lot, Maxwell is the only one to have scored a Test century in India alongside Steve Smith.
“It’s just sticking it out for a little bit longer and I’m sure that’ll be the message, to keep trying to stay up with India and take a hold of those key moments in the game.
“At the start of day three [in Delhi] I thought we were well ahead in the game, and to be ahead of India at any stage of a Test match over there is a sign we’re doing the right things, it’s just doing it for a little bit longer,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Maxwell has been named in the ODI squad for the three games in India beginning March 17. He has not played international cricket since breaking his leg at a birthday party in a freak accident last November.
“I’ve been in constant touch with the selectors for a while now, and it probably hasn’t happened as fast as I’d like,” he said.
“I probably would’ve liked to be playing a little bit earlier, but the fact I knew the timeline for the one day side and the realistic goal, I was able to manipulate my rehab program to fit that timeline I was racing against.

“I never judged myself from that point of view; what we ended up achieving as a team and as a cultural change that always going to be a matter of pride for me.
“A tournament happens for a certain period of time but a culture happens over a long period of time and for that you need consistency for that you need more characters than just winning a tournament.”
“I won a World Cup as a player. I won the Champions Trophy as a player. I have been part of the team that has won five Test maces. If you look at that point of view there have been people, who have never won a World Cup,” he added.
Kohli also spoke about how lucky he was to be part of the 2011 ODI World Cup-winning side.

“To be honest, I was lucky enough to be part of that 2011 team. And what led to my selection was also amazing because I had a great run of great scores, and I ended up being with the team.

Venkatesh Prasad vs Aakash Chopra’s social-media battle and what it says about cricket ecosystem,"When does criticism turn personal? When does defence feel cheer-leader-ish? Welcome to the cricketing world of social media where hipsters, contrarians, bigot, meme-star inhabit","In the last 20 days, former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad has put out 18 tweets to express his displeasure and argue about KL Rahul’s inclusion in the Test team. This includes a long thread of seven posts to throw a lasso around former Test cricketer and YouTuber Aakash Chopra, who had questioned the timing of his criticism. This KL chatter has allegations of favouritism, accusations of agenda-peddling, Chopra’s offer of a live debate and Prasad’s ‘don’t wish to engage with you’ refusal.
No Aakash, nothing is lost in translation. In your 12 minute video you have called me as an agenda peddler because it didn’t suit your narrative.
It is crystal clear. And I have made my points very clear in this Twitter thread. Don’t wish to engage with you further on this 🙏🏼 https://t.co/GhlfWI0kHA
— Venkatesh Prasad (@venkateshprasad) February 21, 2023
Purely going by the book, Prasad can’t be faulted for his serial tweeting. Having represented India with distinction, he has earned the right to judge cricketers. Moreover, Twitter has a limit on characters and not a cap on tweets directed at an individual. But Prasad’s questioning did raise eyebrows for his relentlessness. Never in the short history of cricket’s digital discourse has a former cricketer been so persistent in his demand to drop an active top player.
Welcome to Indian cricket’s highly-volatile, ever-changing new media landscape. It’s a stiflingly crowded world with oceans of opinions, mountains with slippery slopes, and inhabited by restless souls with an insatiable urge to be liked, followed and subscribed. The language is mostly argumentative, conversations peppery and the grammar lacks tonal subtlety. This is a raging democracy that gives equal gravitas to the voice of an anonymous rabid troll or a hardened blue-tick veteran. It’s a terrain that transforms people. And in pursuit to be popular, the new media is also trying to set new rules of engagement.
Read | IND vs AUS: Stripped of vice-captaincy, KL Rahul to lose playing XI spot to Shubman Gill for Indore Test
On the first morning of the India-Australia Test, in Delhi’s late winter golden-hued sunlight, Kotla was the venue for a congress of this smart phone-carrying tribe. Indian cricket’s decision-makers and the army that judged them were not far from each other. Before the toss, scores of television pundits, mostly ex-cricketers, stood on the turf facing cameras, speculating about the playing XIs. Across the fence, in the media box and the stands too, there were arguments about KL’s credentials as a Test cricketer.
There are no readily-available mobile data consumption records at the time of the toss but as soon as Rohit Sharma announced from the central square that KL was in, social media traffic around Delhi 6’s busy ITO junction would have spiked. Instant sermonising was no longer the right of those with a broadcaster’s microphone in hand or the live blog-updating reporters. The non-accredited self-publishing internet users were also telling the world about their take on the playing eleven.

Thousands of frenzied fingers of cricket’s first responders were typing KL Rahul on their phones, some would even mention Rahul Dravid, Rohit, Shubman Gill and even Anna in their posts. If by some miracle Kotla had gone silent for a brief moment, the sound of fingers tapping smartphones would have the deafening clutter of a stadium full of typewriters.
Vying for attention
Regardless of your batting average or wicket count, it’s a challenge to be heard in the social media din of takedowns and shout-outs. This pressure to draw attention, stay relevant, to say something wise quickly and correctly all through the day can take a toll. Expectedly, most cricketers outsource their voice to their teams or to social media spin doctors allegedly equipped to read the pulse of the nation. It’s the first step to raise your profile and even be a product-peddling, message-amplifying, well-paid influencer. In many cases, it has opened the doors for a thriving political career.
Read | IND vs AUS: KL Rahul’s selection is not based on performance but favouritism, says Venkatesh Prasad
Former cricketers take pains, or are told to, carefully craft their social media image. While many remain plain vanilla birthday-wishers, there are others who position themselves cleverly. At present, there is a batsman with contrarian views, a bombastically-hipster all-rounder, one rapidly-rising rabble-rousing bigoted spinner, and a meme-sharing plain funny opener. Never imagined, this is how they would want the world to see them in their second avatar. Just like one didn’t expect Prasad, a bowler famous for his frequent changes of pace, to be an untiring critic of an out-of-form cricketer.

A strict but sensitive coach, back in the day, he loved to talk about the intricacies of pace bowling and insisted on avoiding specific comments about individual bowlers. Even his famous send-off to Aamir Sohail in the 1996 World Cup was nuanced. Pointing to the dressing room, mouthing a quick mandatory invective, he didn’t stop for an eye-to-eye long ugly exchange. He had enough reasons to make it unpleasant but kept running towards his mates to celebrate the crucial wicket. His famous scowl or sledge didn’t have the Virat Kohli voltage.
As a junior India coach, he was strict with the boys but also deeply sensitive towards the teenagers coping with the ups and downs of the very demanding profession they dreamt of pursuing. An incident from the 2006 U-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka, where he was in charge of a very talented team that had Rohit and Cheteshwar Pujara, underlines his empathy for those not in form.

At the start of the ICC event, Prasad had put a condition for all post-match media interactions. He said that along with the day’s top-performer, he would send another player, someone who hadn’t done all that well on the day, for media duties. The idea, he said, was to give equal exposure to everyone in the team and also not make those struggling with form feel unwanted or abandoned.
Game of opinions
With time, people and their opinions change. Closer scrutiny shows that Prasad’s tweets aren’t all angry rants. He does make a few valid points. He talks about the need for players struggling in Tests to have a county stint. The World Cupper follows it with a pertinent question: But will it be possible to skip the IPL? He talks about the team management’s double standards – the length of the rope to KL is not the same as the one given to Kuldeep Yadav.
ADVERTISEMENT
Prasad’s Twitter exchange with Chopra is an interesting insight into most former cricketers’ understanding of their post-retirement careers in media – be it old or new. On his YouTube show, Chopra calls Prasad’s serial posts a “Twitter tirade” and sees this as evidence of agenda-peddling. This raises a couple of counter-questions. Like criticism, shouldn’t unending praise too be seen with suspicion? Can’t there be a hidden motive in talking up a few and ignoring the rest? Do broadcasters too have an agenda when they break into Virat Kohli specials, even on days when Axar Patel has emerged as a world-class all-rounder?
There is a Chopra tweet that needs special attention. It’s in reaction to Prasad’s tweet about KL Rahul’s first innings failure at Kotla.
“Venky Bhai, Test match chal raha hai. How about, at least, waiting for both the innings to get over? All of us are in the same team i.e. Team India. Not asking you to hold back your thoughts but timing could be a little better. After all, our game is all about the ‘timing’” – tweeted Chopra.

— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) February 19, 2023
A couple of takeaways from the tweet: Like the ‘first ball is trial’ street-cricket rule, first innings failures too should be pardonable by law. And since Chopra says that ‘all of us are in the same team, i.e. Team India’, the next time an Indian captain walks out for a toss with the team sheet, for the sake of transparency, he should have an extra page with names of every former cricketer in the commentary box and also those on Twitter.

“I don’t want him [Cummins] carrying the burden of so much captaincy for too long,” Healy said on SENQ’s Pat and Heals.
“I want him to finish as just a bowler. The captaincy creates a burnout and four to five years is a long time as captain.
“He’s done a few years already. Now he’s adding short-form captaincy to his thought process at a time when he’s dealing with some sort of family illness back home.
“So yeah, I would like to see him finish his career as a tearaway fast bowler and someone else with the captaincy burden.”
Healy backed middle-order batsman Travis Head to lead Australia in the near future.
“I think Travis Head is quite capable,” Healy said.
“He’s led South Australia since he was a 21-year-old, he’s quite capable and has got a lot of experience. He’s the main one that stands out to me.

“The likes of Glenn Maxwell might be able to do parts of it in the short form, but as far as longer-term captaincy prospects other than Travis Head, I can’t think of any.”

Renard is arguably France’s greatest women’s footballer. She has played 142 internationals, adding 34 goals. Renard has won 15 league titles and eight Champions League trophies with Lyon.
Following Renard’s decision on Friday, striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto and forward Kadidiatou Diani also announced they were putting their international careers on hold.
Although Renard stopped short of retiring, she said she no longer felt able to play for the national team.
“I love France more than anything, I am not perfect, far from it, but I can no longer accept the current system which is far away from the demands required at the highest level,” Renard wrote on her Instagram page.
“It’s a sad day but a necessary one to protect my mental health. It’s with a heavy heart that, with this message, I inform you of my decision to take a step back from the France team. Unfortunately I won’t play in the World Cup under these conditions.”
Renard did not go further into detail, but there have been strong tensions in the France squad for years between the players and coach Corinne Diacre.

After taking charge in 2017, Diacre stripped Renard of the captain’s armband then gave it back to her in 2021.
Katoto posted on Twitter, “I’ve taken the decision to put my international career aside until the necessary changes have been made.”
Diani said on Twitter she will return to the national side only if significant changes are made.

Sergio Garcia: Rory McIlroy ‘lacking maturity’,"McIlroy, 33, partnered with Garcia in the Ryder Cup and served as a groomsman at his wedding in 2017. McIlroy, however, told the Irish Independent that he was offended that Garcia sent him a text during last year's U.S. Open ""basically telling me to shut up about LIV, blah, blah, blah.""","Accusing Rory McIlroy of lacking maturity about players’ PGA Tour-LIV decisions, Sergio Garcia also blamed him for ending their friendship after the latter left for the upstart circuit last year.
“I think it is very sad,” Garcia, 43, told the Telegraph on Thursday ahead of this weekend’s LIV season opener at Mayakoba. “I think that we’ve done so many things together and had so many experiences that for him to throw that away just because I decided to go to a different tour, well, it doesn’t seem very mature; lacking maturity, really.
“But Rory’s got his own life, and he makes his own choices, the same way that I make mine. I respect his choices, but it seems like he doesn’t respect the ones I make. So, one-way street.”
McIlroy, 33, partnered with Garcia in the Ryder Cup and served as a groomsman at his wedding in 2017. McIlroy, however, told the Irish Independent that he was offended that Garcia sent him a text during last year’s U.S. Open “basically telling me to shut up about LIV, blah, blah, blah.”
Garcia told the Telegraph he’d be open to clearing the air, but it doesn’t appear that will happen.
“Sure, I don’t have a problem with him,” Garcia said. “He’s the one that has a problem. So if he wants to reconcile, then I’m willing to talk, but I’m not sure he’ll put himself down to that level.”
If the LIV players win an arbitration case that would allow them to remain on the DP World Tour, the rift between the two stars could grow deeper. It would allow Garcia — the all-time Ryder Cup points leader — and other LIV members earn points toward automatic qualification for the Ryder Cup. Also, if they play well enough but don’t automatically qualify, European captain Luke Donald could add them with any of his six wild-card selections.

Star pacer Ismail brought back South Africa in the game with a double strike in the sixth over. Both Dunkley and incoming batter Alice Capsey (0) were caught at midwicket by Britz. The one-handed catch to dismiss Capsey off a short ball stood out among the four catches she took in the game.

In Southee’s next over, ninth of the day, Brook looted three fours, two square drives but it was the third that was startling. He charged down the track to wallop it over mid-on. Soon, he would repeatedly start moving outside the leg stump, and whack Neil Wagner wherever his mood seized. A pull, a thwack over mid-on, and one astonishing flat-batted crunch to the straight boundary.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/new-zealand-vs-england-prodigious-talent-harry-brook-breaks-30-year-old-record-held-by-vinod-kambli-with-an-unbeaten-184-8465178/,sports

‘They need absolute danda’: Former India women’s captain slams Harmanpreet & Co.,"Edulji, who was part of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee which ran the BCCI for 33 months, was appalled at the fielding effort displayed by India in the T20 World Cup semifinal in Cape Town on Thursday.","Former captain Diana Edulji has no qualms in saying that India’s U-19 stars fielded way better in their victorious T20 World Cup campaign in comparison to the seniors’ effort in South Africa and reckons that most of them will struggle if the ‘yo yo’ test becomes mandatory in women’s cricket.
Edulji, who was part of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee which ran the BCCI for 33 months, was appalled at the fielding effort displayed by India in the T20 World Cup semifinal in Cape Town on Thursday.
Speaking to PTI, Edulji said the poor standard of fitness was responsible for the team’s ordinary fielding and running between the wickets. She also thought skipper Harmanpreet Kaur was casual while running the second run before the bat got stuck in the ground and led to a game-changing run out.
With another T20 World Cup scheduled in September next year, Edulji wants the BCCI to appoint permanent support staff in the women’s team rather getting personnel from the NCA on an ad-hoc basis.
“Most will fail yo yo test”
Edulji slammed the fitness levels of the current squad, saying the triumphant U-19 World Cup winning squad looked fitter.
“I found the U-19 team much fitter than the seniors. They didn’t choke in the final. From 2017 to 2023 it is the same old story (for the senior team).
“The BCCI must have proper assessment of players’ fitness. I know yo yo test is a bit tough for women. Out of 15 , 12 will fail that test but you have a different criteria for them for acceptable fitness standards. Right now there is no accountability on that front,” she told PTI a day after India’s five run loss in the semifinals.

India were poor in their fielding and catching while Australia were brilliant, making the difference in the end.
“You are definitely looking at an overhaul (in terms of planning and preparation after the World Cup loss). They need to improve fitness first of all, their fielding, their catching running between the wickets. Unless you have strength in the legs, you won’t be able to run.
“They need absolute danda (BCCI needs to crack the whip) to reach the top. You are getting everything from the BCCI including equal play.
“Every time you lose a winning game, it is a habit. BCCI has to take a strong call and not give in to the demands of the players.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Have a proper strategy for the future. We have had enough of this star culture. It is not going to work like this,” said Edulji.
“Harman was casual while taking the second run”
Harmanpreet’s run out was the turning point of the game and Edulji felt the India skipper could have done better.
“She is thinking the bat got stuck but if you see the second run she was jogging. Why are you running in a relaxed manner when you know when your wicket is so important? You have to play professional cricket to win. Look at the dive Perry made to save those two runs. That is what professionalism is.
“They don’t give up till the end and we are not ready to fight at all. You can’t be falling at the last hurdle all the time.
ADVERTISEMENT
“She was casual on the second run. She thought she would comfortably reach. We were told in the 1970s by Mr. Sunil Gavaskar that every ball you have to learn to ground your bat then only you get into that habit,” she said.
“Shafali’s shot selection is poor”
Though still a teenager, Shafali Verma is into her fourth year of international cricket. She was below par in the World Cup and did not have the best of times in the U-19 World Cup where she was captain.
“If Shafali Verma thinks she can’t be dropped then she is mistaken. I would like to see videos of her getting out, which ball has been good enough to get her out? Her shot selection is so poor.
“Even in the U-19 World Cup, she did not perform with the bat though the team won. Let the other U-19 opener (Shweta Sehrawat) come in and take her place.
ADVERTISEMENT
“And what was the need for Jemimah for play that shot? You just got a four before, read the game a little more considering the game situation.
“Smriti and Harman too have been inconsistent that is why India have not won a major tournament. The talent is there but they have to be given rigourous training. We have enough firepower in the batting department.” Edulji feels a change in leadership will not make much of a difference.
“A captain is as good as the team. if Smriti comes in, same players are there. It won’t make much of a difference. Also it’s high time that musical chairs of the support staff is stopped. What is the bowling coach doing? The bowling has deteriorated. Spinners have completely gone out of form.

"‘Aur kitna achha chahiye aapko, 300 karlien’: Watch Babar Azam’s epic reply on strike rate",Babar Azam was subjected to harsh criticism for his poor strike rate despite contributing with a respectable knock for Peshawar Zalmi in PSL 2023.,"Babar Azam-led Peshawar Zalmi was defeated by Shadab Khan’s Islamabad United in Match 12 of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2023 on Thursday.
Islamabad United won the toss and opted to field. Batting first, Peshawar scored 156/8 in 20 overs with Babar Azam top-scoring with 75 not out.
In reply, Islamabad reached the target in just 14.5 overs, Rahmanullah Gurbaz scoring 62 off 31 balls and Rassie van der Dussen smashing 42 off 29 balls.
Babar, however, was subjected to harsh criticism for his poor strike rate despite contributing with a respectable knock for his side.
During the post-match conference, when a journalist questioned the skipper about his strike rate, Babar gave a hilarious reply and said, “Aur kitna accha [strike rate] chahiye aapko? 300 kar lein? Koshish hai (How much better do you want? Why not 300? I am trying to reach there as well)”

The journalist then said, “you are batting brilliantly, I am not questioning you on that…you are world number 1 but it is said that you can improve your strike rate in T20s.”
To this, the 28-year-old batter replied, “People talk when I bat at a good strike rate as well, so that doesn’t bother me. In the first 10 overs, I was striking at 160 and when we were 6 down, there you don’t focus on increasing your strike rate, rather I would build a partnership then and that was my plan in today’s innings.”
“When you build a certain momentum, you try to carry it for long unless it gets broken by a wicket or two, or when you are not able to hit. Then my plan was to build a partnership after the 10-over mark because I told Shanaka that we’ll play normally till 15 overs and then take the charge. Then we lost back-to-back wickets and in that process, the strike rate is bound to come down and it was still 150,” he added.

Ministry unhappy with top wrestlers for skipping international meets,"The top wrestlers including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Ravi Dahiya, Deepak Punia, Anshu Malik and Sangita Mor have skipped UWW Ranking Series events in Zagreb and Alexandria as a probe panel is investigating the sexual abuse allegations against WFI chief","The Sports Ministry is apparently livid with country’s top wrestlers for opting out of international events in the wake of their ongoing stand-off with the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and its chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.
The top wrestlers including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Ravi Dahiya, Deepak Punia, Anshu Malik and Sangita Mor have skipped UWW Ranking Series events in Zagreb and Alexandria as a probe panel is investigating the sexual abuse allegations against WFI chief, who has stepped aside pending enquiry.
The move has irked the government, which provides financial assistance to the wrestlers under Target Olympics Podium Scheme (TOPS) to support their preparation and training.
“We don’t get it why they are not competing when their demands have been met. We need to give time to the committee to complete its probe. It is wrestlers’ decision and we can’t force anyone but they should not have missed the events,” a ministry official said.
The sport is currently being run by a six-member Oversight Committee, led by legendary boxer MC Mary Kom.
The committee is investigating into the claims that Brij Bhushan has sexually harassed several women wrestlers and also intimidates the athletes.
The ministry was forced to set up the panel after the wrestlers staged a sit-in protest at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed from the top post and WFI be disbanded.
ADVERTISEMENT
The ministry asked the committee, formed on January 23, to submit its report within four weeks and asked Brij Bhushan to step aside till the completion of the probe.
As per the earlier deadline, the committee was scheduled to submit its report on February 23 but the ministry has given a two-week extension after being asked for some more time.

"Arsenal’s Partey in contention for Leicester trip, Jesus still out","Partey missed Arsenal's 3-1 home defeat by Manchester City and 4-2 comeback victory at Aston Villa last week due to a lower back injury, while Jesus has been out of action since suffering a knee problem playing for Brazil at the World Cup in Qatar.","Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey could be back for the Premier League leaders at Leicester City on Saturday but Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus is still recovering from his long-term injury, manager Mikel Arteta said.
Partey missed Arsenal’s 3-1 home defeat by Manchester City and 4-2 comeback victory at Aston Villa last week due to a lower back injury, while Jesus has been out of action since suffering a knee problem playing for Brazil at the World Cup in Qatar.
“Thomas has not trained much but looks like he could be available. Let’s see how he trains today,” Arteta told reporters on Friday on the eve of the visit to 14th-placed Leicester.
“He is a really important player for us who we missed in the last few games but hopefully he can be available.
“(Jesus) is progressing well. He is doing more and more on the field. The knee is not reacting so it’s really positive. We want him back quickly but respect the timeline from the doctors. He is usually pushing the boundaries.”
Arsenal lead the table with 54 points, two above second-placed City who have played a game more. Manchester United sit third with 49, while Tottenham Hotspur are fourth on 42.
But Arteta believes the championship is not a two-horse race.

“I think there are more teams involved and every day is going to be a race – a race to convince those players how to train better, to play better,” he said.
“Against Leicester, we are going to have to be really good to beat them, especially with the way they have been playing the last few weeks.”

Selles appointed Southampton manager until end of season,"Spanish coach Selles, 39, was placed in temporary charge after Nathan Jones was sacked on Feb. 12 following a dismal run of nine defeats in 14 games that left Southampton sitting at the bottom of the standings with 18 points.","Relegation-threatened Southampton have appointed interim coach Ruben Selles as their manager until the end of the season, the Premier League club said on Friday.
Spanish coach Selles, 39, was placed in temporary charge after Nathan Jones was sacked on Feb. 12 following a dismal run of nine defeats in 14 games that left Southampton sitting at the bottom of the standings with 18 points.
Selles led Southampton to a 1-0 victory over Chelsea last Saturday. His first task in his newly confirmed post will be this Saturday’s trip to relegation rivals Leeds United.
Jones’s departure came 95 days after he was appointed in November as Ralph Hasenhuettl’s replacement, days before the World Cup break.
Selles, Southampton’s third head coach this season, was also in interim charge when Hasenhuettl was sacked in November and he oversaw a League Cup penalty shootout win over Sheffield Wednesday.
Selles joined Southampton in July 2022 as an assistant to Hasenhuettl. He has previously managed Valencia’s under-18 team and has coaching experience in Greece, Denmark and Azerbaijan.

"‘The bowler is not the villain here’, says Kumar Sangakkara on batters stealing ground at non-striker end","""Every batter has a choice; to stay in their ground, or risk being given out if they try to steal ground, If they choose the latter, they are the ones who are breaking the Law,"" says Kumar Sangakkara.","The World Cricket Committee of the MCC, the custodians of the laws of the game, wants to see the non-striker being run out by the bowler normalised at all age-group levels besides calling for “calm” on the contentious subject.
Last month, the MCC issued a clarification to the wording of the law following an incident in which bowler Adam Zampa attempted to run out non-striker Tom Rogers in a Big Bash game in January. The clarification involved changing the wording of Law 38.3 to deliver better clarity and dispel “misconceptions” on it. The World Cricket Committee (WCC) of the MCC, which met at the ICC headquarters in Dubai last week, is now calling for calm across all levels of the game — from the grassroots level of recreational cricket to the elite level — given that the act of running out a non-striker who opts to steal ground is within the laws of the game.
“The overriding factor is that there is a simple way that all confusion and controversy around this form of dismissal can be eradicated – by non-strikers complying with the Law and remaining within their ground until they have seen the ball being released from the bowler’s hand,” the MCC said in a statement.
“Part of the discussion in Dubai touched on the growing narrative for the bowler to be vilified for this type of dismissal. The committee members were unanimous in their view that the batter stealing ground is the one breaking the Laws of the game and therefore deserving of recrimination.
“They were also in agreement that there is no precedent to require a bowler to give a warning to a batter, confirming they are completely within their right to dismiss the batter on the first occasion they break the Law,” it added.
The WCC comprises greats of the game including Kumar Sangakkara, Sourav Ganguly, Justin Langer, Alastair Cook, with Mike Gatting being the chairman.
“The bowler is not the villain here. Every batter has a choice; to stay in their ground, or risk being given out if they try to steal ground. If they choose the latter, they are the ones who are breaking the Law,” said Sri Lankan great Sangakkara.

Gatting added: “We have seen suggestions that this method of dismissal will be attempted more and more at recreational level and there is the possibility of matches descending into chaos. “Whilst attempts may increase in the short term, we would expect batters to learn their responsibilities under the Laws very quickly and drive it out of prominence.”

Although the wording of the Law has recently been clarified, the timing of when the run out can be attempted is unchanged since 2017, so very little has actually changed.
“Our stance on this is simple batters must not steal ground if they do not wish to be given out in this manner. Nor should they be expecting to be given a warning if they do.
“If all non-strikers only left the popping crease once the ball had been released, there would never be the need for such a dismissal again,” said the former England batter.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/the-bowler-is-not-the-villain-here-says-wcc-member-kumar-sangakkara-on-batters-stealing-ground-at-non-striker-end-8464016/,sports

Australia have suffered twin injuries blow ahead of the third Test with pacer Josh Hazlewood and opener David Warner are ruled out from the remaining two matches. Hazlewood will fly home to Australia due to an ongoing Achilles injury, while Warner has been ruled out of Australia’s remaining two Test matches in India after injuring his elbow and sustaining a concussion. Left-arm spinner, Ashton Agar, who was in the original squad, is all set to fly home.
However, Cameron Green and Mitchell Starc’s availability will give a boost to Australia. Green’s return would give Australia a second seam-bowling option and they can afford to play three spinners.

"NZ vs ENG: Henry Brook, Joe Root put England in charge in 2nd Test vs New Zealand",A day which began without promise with a lost toss and three early wickets ended after only 65 overs and after a parade of records and milestones which saw England take almost unbreakable control of the match and series.,"Harry Brook made 184 and Joe Root 101 in an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 294 which carried England to 315-3 at stumps Friday on the rain-shortened first day of the second cricket test against New Zealand.
A day which began without promise with a lost toss and three early wickets ended after only 65 overs and after a parade of records and milestones which saw England take almost unbreakable control of the match and series.
Brook’s score was his highest in tests, beating his 153 against Pakistan in December, and was his fourth century in his last five tests. He also has three half centuries and now has 807 runs from only nine test innings, more than any other player in the history of Test cricket at that point in their careers.

Behind him now are players such as Henry Sutcliff, Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Sunil Gavaskar. His score already is the highest by an England batsman in Wellington.
Brook said he went to the crease with England 21-3 with “just the usual mindset, just the way I’ve been playing the whole time I’ve been playing test cricket to be honest.
“I looked to put pressure on the bowler and be as positive as possible,” he said. “I did change a few little things but the more positive you are generally the more you get away with.” Root has his 29th Test century, completing the milestone a moment before the rain began. The partnership between Yorkshiremen now is England’s highest for the fourth wicket against New Zealand.
England reinforced the superiority over New Zealand the visitors showed in the first test which they won by 267 runs and they now look likely to become the first team to beat New Zealand in a test series at home for six years.

Brook was ‘man in the match’ for his scores of 89 and 54 in the first test, both of which were made at better than a run a ball and helped take that match away from New Zealand.
The home team had only a few days to regroup from that mauling and were reinforced Friday by the return of fast bowler Matt Henry and batsman Will Young while England happily named an unchanged side.
New Zealand would have been happy when it won the toss and bowled first, more so when Henry and Tim South had early success and England stumbled to 21-3 in less than seven overs.
Then came Brook and once again the match was transformed. His first half century was sedate by his standards, coming from 51 balls and his century came from 107 deliveries, the second 50 from 56 balls. He then went on to 150 from 145 balls, having stepping up his and England’s scoring. The third half century needed only 38 balls and was a trial for New Zealand who saw the match slipping away.

New Zealand had taken the risk of playing with an extra batsman, perhaps motivated by the dual failure of their top order in the first test. That left them with the all-rounder Daryl Mitchell as their third seamer, bowling relatively unthreatening medium pace.
And they went again with Neil Wagner who England milked for 192 runs from just over 29 overs in the first test.
Brook might have shown some caution at the start of the innings after seeing Zac Crawley, Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope all fall to catches behind the wicket.
But after a settling in period he approached his innings with typical forcefulness while Root provided him unwavering support.

Chess player expelled for using mobile phone in toilet,"Mihalache found using Chess Apps on a mobile phone hidden in toilet, faces FIDE disciplinary charges","Paul-Stelian Mihalache, a player with a FIDE rating of 1698, has been expelled from Romanian Chess Championship after a mobile phone was found in his restroom. The issue has been brought to the notice of the FIDE’s disciplinary commission and the player faces a ban for a certain period of time.
During the fifth round of the Romanian Championship, a nine-round Swiss tournament currently underway in Sebes, Mihalache showed suspicious behavior which included frequent visits to the restroom.
After one of his frequent visits, an arbiter decided to check one of the toilet cubicles where a smart phone was found. The phone, which was left unlocked, had three chess apps on it with one showing Mihalache’s game after 15 moves with the engine Stockfish 15 runnings. A Google account with Mihalache’s name and email address was also active on the phone.
Right through the tournament a special anti-cheating officer has been doing random checks before and during the matches on players using metal detectors. After the phone was found, Mihalache was subjected to an inspection in a separate room, but no devices were found. And confronted with the information about the smart phone found in the washroom which had his Google account and the Chess app, the player denied it was his. However, he did sign the scoresheet which declared he lad lost the game.
Such incidents are not new in Chess. In 2015, Georgian grandmaster Gaioz Nigalidze was found using iPod at the Dubai Open and was expelled from the tournament. He even ended up losing his GM tag.
And more recently, Magnus Carlsen had found Hans Niemann’s behaviour to be suspicious and pulled-out of a tournament.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/chess/chess-player-paul-stelian-mihalache-expelled-for-using-mobile-phone-in-toilet-8463846/,sports

"Matthew Hayden masterclass on sweep shot. When Hayden asked Harbhajan Singh, ‘how is my ability now?’","The story of how Hayden, who has offered to help the current Australians, consciously worked on his sweep shot for the 2001 Test series in India","It was a sight for the ages, the tall huge Matthew Hayden swiftly going down on his knee to repeatedly hammer the sweep shot against Harbhajan Singh and co. in the 2001 Test series in India. He was on air during Australia’s harakiri by sweep last week on a low surface at Delhi and moved to blurt out, “you can’t sweep on this surface”. As if he couldn’t understand what his eyes revealed to him.
Another man in Australia, Allan Border, was sharper with his assessment: “They panicked, and you can’t tell me that the reverse sweep or sweeping on that sort of pitch is the ideal way of scoring your runs,” he told Fox Cricket.
It was Border, along with the coach Bob Simpson, who had kickstarted Hayden’s tryst with the sweep all those years back. In fact, the seed was planted not in some four-day camp ahead of the series but a decade back in 1993.

“The seed was planted in 1993 when I was working with Allan Border and Bob Simpson. Border was a very good sweeper as well and I got the foundation of it from him: understanding when and how, what lines to play, and picked his mind on that,” Hayden had once told this correspondent. “Have you thought about the sweep shot?’ They taught me the basics of it – keeping the head in line of the ball, hitting through the ball and also when not to hit it.”
And then, two years before the famous Test series, came a seminal spin’s camp in 1999 in Chennai where Hayden ran into the Indian greats Erapalli Prasanna and Bishen Singh Bedi. That changed Hayden’s game against spin to another level.
“It [the spin camp] was a very important camp. Based on that experience, I was able to formulate a game plan and batting strategy,” Hayden said. “Importantly, I came to understand the mindset of a spinner. I practised a variety of shots, tried out lots of options and developed my game against spin.” Incidentally, Todd Murphy, the off spin bowler who troubled India at Nagpur, too had been to a spin camp in Chennai last year. But back to Hayden.
Clarke joined calls for Matthew Hayden, who has 30 Test centuries including two in India, to be brought into the Aussie support staff.
Prasanna had once shared what he and Bedi had taught and observed in Hayden.

“We told him, ‘either you take the ball on the full or wait’. And we also talked about his sweep shot,” Prasanna said. “Some batsmen usually take the left leg out and expose the middle stump. We asked Hayden to get in line a bit more before he plays that shot forcefully. He was obviously a very keen student.” Hayden would pull out the sweep when the ball began to turn, to put doubts in the umpire’s minds in the pre-DRS era that it could be missing the stumps, when it hit the pad.
Hayden’s attacking game against spin began to take shape. “I had a solid defensive strategy but what I came prepared to was to have an attacking strategy with that sweep. I prepared hard for that and sweeping was a strategy. It has been copied around the world now really. Most left-handers now look to play that sweep as a go-to shot to scoring,” Hayden said.
The spin camp wasn’t the end of it. Just before he came to India in 2001, Hayden would ask Ross Harris, then the curator at the Allan Border Field in Queensland, to replicate Indian conditions for his sweep-shot practice. Days were spent honing the shot.Hayden also opened the bat-face bit more than what he would do in Australia – “you tend to close the bat’s face in Australia because you don’t want anything angling across the bat and get caught out in the slips”.

Hayden’s sweep shot too was a touch different from the likes that Joe Root, say, employs. The bat-parallel-to-the-ground sweep, as played often by Root who sweeps the entire arc from wide mid-on to backward square-leg after crouching really low with the bat coming from the side of the ball, almost.

Hayden would smash the ball from the top; the bat would come crashing down on the ball to negate the bounce. Like England’s former captain Graham Gooch, who once swept India out of the 1987 world cup, would do.
“You can handle the extra bounce with this movement – swooping down from the top. It helps keep the ball down somewhat and this top-to-bottom sweep also allows a batsman to rotate strike. You can access the areas safely,” Gooch once told this newspaper.

“If you want to hit the ball for a six, then you go from low to high with the bat flow,” Gooch says. “The bat also comes out differently for a lap or when you want to keep it along the ground and where you want to hit it – behind square or front of square. So, all these decisions you have to take in the semi-premeditative shot and based on what comes out of the hand. You can’t be lazy with this shot.”
Gooch has a length in mind to pull out the sweep shot. “My principle was that the ball I tried to sweep is the same I would play a forward defensive to. The kind of ball that can potentially hit the splice of the bat, too, you would want to lap or sweep them. Also, important to mix things up. Not be unidimensional with the sweep. In my career, I have tried to play a mixed game to the turning ball – sweep, occasional use of the feet, backfoot nudges, laps. I didn’t look to attack all the time – barring that ’87 semi-final game.”

One final story for the road, from Hayden. In that 2001 series, he played a tour game and came against Harbhajan Singh, but interestingly he says he chose to hide the fact that he could sweep and attack. It was a game against India A in Nagpur where Harbhajan picked five wickets in the match (2 and 3 respectively in both innings) and Hayden hit 49 and 37.
“My battles with Harbhajan [Singh] started in a warm-up game. I didn’t want to give him any indication of my abilities. So, I had a very defensive game plan and I wanted to see if I could survive against him without revealing my arsenal. He came up to me and politely mentioned just how disappointed he was that a player of my credentials was even considered to play for Australia. I took all that on board and he actually dismissed me that day as well,” he once told Bcci.tv. “I think off his second or third ball in the Test, I came down the wicket and hit him with ease over extra-cover and asked him, ‘How’s my ability now?’”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-matthew-hayden-masterclass-on-sweep-shot-when-hayden-asked-harbhajan-singh-8463786/,sports

"Watch: Manchester United, Barcelona players in ugly scuffle",Bruno Fernandes smashes ball at De Jong as temperatures flare in Europa League play-off match,"In a match where tensions simmered between both Manchester United and Barcelona, a ugly spat ensured between both the teams during their Europa League encounter at the Old Trafford.
Goals from Fred and Anthony helped hosts United come back from a goal down to beat Barcelona and ensured their place in the last-16.
There were some ugly scenes around the hour mark after Frenkie De Jong was fouled by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. As the Dutch midfielder was on the ground, United’s temperamental skipper Bruno Fernandes smashed the ball at De Jong leading to Barcelona players angry reaction.
Watch Video: 
Several United and Barcelona players were involved in the scuffle – including defensive midfielder Casemiro, who was sent off following a similar incident during a Premier League game against Crystal Palace earlier this month. There were no red cards handed out on the occasion.
De Jong was one of United’s summer targets before he decided to stay put at Barcelona. The 25-year-old was coached by current United manager Erik ten Hag during their time together at Ajax, where they won the Eredivisie and Cup in the 2018/19 season.
During the 2019 transfer window, De Jong was bought by Barcelona and ever since Ten Hag took charge at United last summer, the club has been looking to bring the Dutch player to Old Trafford. United had even agreed a transfer with Barcelona for the midfielder, but De Jong wanted to stay at the Camp Nou to continue playing under Xavi.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/europa-league-manchester-united-barcelona-players-in-ugly-scuffle-8463727/,sports
"Sergio Ramos announces Spain retirement, slams manager",Spain's most-capped player to continue play club football as new Spain manager says Ramos is not part of his plans,"Spain’s most capped player Sergio Ramos has announced his retirement from international football following a phone call with new manager Luis de la Fuente. Ramos, who was part of Spain’s World Cup and Euro winning teams had represented Real Madrid in La Liga and now plays for PSG in Ligue 1.
“The time has come, the time to say goodbye to the National Team, our beloved and exciting Red,” Ramos wrote. “This morning I received the call from the current coach who told me that he doesn’t count and that he won’t count on me, regardless of the level I can show or how I continue my sporting career.”
Ramos made his Spain debut in 2005. He went on to play 180 times for his country, and was part of the squad which won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championships in 2008 and 2012.
Seguiré animando a mi país desde casa con la emoción del privilegiado que ha podido representarlo orgulloso 180 veces. ¡Gracias de corazón a todos los que siempre creísteis en mí! ❤️💛❤️ pic.twitter.com/KzVldPhiqo

However as Spain pressed a reset button after the 2018 World Cup, he was left out of the national squads for the Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup. After their shock defeat against Morocco eliminated them, Luis Henrique stepped down as manager and before de la Fuente took charge and informed Ramos that he is not part of his plans going forward.
“With great regret, it is the end of a journey that I hoped would be longer and that would end with a better taste in the mouth, on the height of all the successes we have achieved with our Red,” Ramos’ statement continued. “Humbly, I think that that career deserved to end because of a personal decision or because my performance was not up to what our National Team deserves, but not because of age or other reasons that, without having heard them, I have felt.
“Because being young or less young is not a virtue or a defect, it is only a temporary trait that is not necessarily related to performance or ability. I look with admiration and envy at Modric, Messi, Pepe… the essence, tradition, values, meritocracy and justice in football.
“Unfortunately it won’t be like that for me, because football is not always fair and football is never just football. Through it all I take it with this sadness that I want to share with you, but also with my head very high and very grateful for all these years and for all your support.

"How Mac McClung, an undrafted player who was dropped by G League teams, became ‘saviour’ of NBA’s Dunk Contest","During NBA's All-Star weekend, Mac McClung becomes only the second white player to win the dunk contest","Just before the Dunk Contest at the 2023 NBA All-Star Weekend started, basketball legend-turned-analyst Shaquille O’Neal filmed himself telling Mac McClung: “This is where you steal the show. Nobody knows your name. Make them remember your name. And don’t miss a dunk!”
Over the course of four dunks, McClung did all of that at Salt Lake City. He did so well, in fact, that Shaq and Magic Johnson later said that McClung had ‘saved the dunk contest’. LeBron James went even further in his praise, putting McClung’s defiance of gravity on par with the iconic performances in the past by Michael Jordan and Vince Carter. With their praise, the three NBA superstars had put on a lofty pedestal a man who, until a week before the All-Star Weekend, none of the 30 NBA teams had deemed worthy of even a spot on their rosters.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/basketball/how-an-undrafted-player-who-was-dropped-by-g-league-teams-became-the-saviour-of-nbas-dunk-contest-8463364/,sports
Sergio Ramos retires from Spain duty with parting shot at coach,Sergio Ramos was dropped by former Spain coach Luis Enrique and had not made an appearance since coming on as a late substitute in a 3-1 win over Kosovo in a World Cup qualifier two years ago. ,"Spain’s most capped player Sergio Ramos announced his international retirement on Thursday after being told by new coach Luis de la Fuente that he was not part of his plans.
The 36-year-old Paris St Germain defender, who won the World Cup in 2010 as well as two European Championships, has not played for Spain since March 2021, yet said he should have been given the chance to show he could still be of service to his country.
“The time has come, the time to say goodbye to our beloved and exciting national team,” Ramos, who captained Spain 52 times, said in a statement.
“This morning I received the call from the current coach who told me that he doesn’t and will not count on me, regardless of the level I can show or how I continue my sporting career.”
The Spanish FA (RFEF) confirmed to Reuters that the conversation between coach De la Fuente and Ramos took place on Thursday, but provided no further details.
Ramos was dropped by former Spain coach Luis Enrique and had not made an appearance since coming on as a late substitute in a 3-1 win over Kosovo in a World Cup qualifier two years ago.
“Humbly, I think that my path deserved to end because of my personal decision or if my performance was not up to the level that our national team deserve, but not because of age or other reasons,” Ramos said.

Anish Bhanwala’s breakthrough: Young shooter wins first senior World Cup medal in Cairo,20-year-old Indian got the better of Rio Olympic champion Christian Reitz of Germany to finish on the podium in Cairo,"After winning the bronze medal in the men’s 25m Rapid Fire Pistol final in the ISSF World Cup in Cairo on Thursday afternoon, 20-year-old Anish Bhanwala was in for a pleasant surprise. Rio Olympic champion Christian Reitz of Germany, the shooter Bhanwala had edged out for the bronze medal, came over and spoke to him. Bhanwala admitted the short chat with the 35-year-old German was a fan-boy moment.
“For any young shooter Christian Reitz remains an idol. To win my first senior World Cup medal ahead of him is a special feeling. I will always remember this medal for his appreciation post the medal ceremony. There was pressure during ranking as well as the medal match. But to win the medal here at Cairo, in tough conditions… I see it as a new phase in my career,” Bhanwala told The Indian Express from Cairo
One of the biggest takeaways from the World Cup for Bhanwala is how he performed when under the cosh. The bronze was also his first senior World Cup medal.
“I had competed against Reitz and others in two tournaments in Europe last year and that held me in good stead today. When Reitz shot a perfect series, I just wanted to enjoy my shooting and the perfect five came at the right time for me,” Bhanwala said.
He has taken some time to win his first senior World Cup medal.
Bhanwala’s talent came to notice when he became the senior national champion in 2017. In the field that day was London Olympics silver medalist Kumar.
“When I became the national champion, his (Vijay Kumar’s) praise meant more than the gold medal for me. I understand I got early success at a young age and could not maintain my form in senior-level competition after the CWG games (2018),” Bhanwala admitted.

Bhanwala, whose father Jagpal Bhanwala owns farm land and is a lawyer in Gohana, started off as a pentathlon shooter before he switched to pistol events under the guidance of 2014 CWG silver medal-winning shooter Harpreet Singh, who also happens to be his neighbour.
Post the national title in 2017, Bhanwala was seen as the next big shooter to emerge in the event. He had titles to back his talent. He won junior world titles in 2017, 2018 and 2019. He also became India’s youngest medal-winner at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast with a final record of 30 shots.
However, he missed the Tokyo Olympics bus.
A fifth place in the ISSF World Cup in Delhi in 2021 meant that he couldn’t bag a Tokyo Olympics quota through world rankings. “When I missed the medal in the Delhi World Cup, I knew I was not ready for the Tokyo Olympics,” Bhanwala said.
Post the Olympics, Bhanwala spent some time with his mentor and coach Harpreet at the Dr Karni Singh Range in New Delhi. Harpreet emphasised on going back to the basics during training sessions.
ADVERTISEMENT
“His main strength has been his retention power and there are moments when he remembers one particular thing from a training session 3-4 years ago and tells me to work on it. Post the Delhi World Cup, we worked on making his head position more stable apart from spending some time on getting his pistol lift better along with his posture,” Harpreet said.
On Thursday, Bhanwala finished seventh in qualification with one shooter not eligible for the ranking match. His seventh-place finish meant that he shot in the second relay, comprising second-placed Matej Rampula of Czech Republic, Yan Chesnel of France and Massimo Spinella of Italy. Bhanwala shot a score of 12 after the end of the fourth series and was tied with Chesnel for the second spot. In the first shoot-off, Bhanwala and Chesnel shot three points each before both tied again with four points each in the second shoot-off.
In the third shoot-off, Bhawala shot four points while Chisnel shot two to hand the Indian a spot in the medal match. With Reitz and Clement Bessaguet of France qualifying from the first relay, Bhanwala started the medal round with a perfect series of five to lead. The second series saw him missing three shots (a score above 9.7 is counted as a shot) and the youngster dropped to second. Having shot four in the third series, Bhanwala was in the lead along with Tokyo Olympics finalist Bessaguet at 11 points. With Reitz shooting a perfect 5 in the fourth series to be at 12 points and Bessaguet and Spienella at 20 and 19 respectively, Bhanwala needed to shoot a minimum of three shots to be assured of a medal ahead of Reitz. The youngster shot a perfect series of five to assure himself of a medal before bowing out in the next series.
India’s foreign pistol coach and two-time Olympic medallist Munkhbyar Dorjsuren was watching the final in the coach’s corner and counts this medal as an important one for the youngster. “Anish is a very humble shooter and eager to learn. He has good potential and he displayed that today. It’s an important medal for him and a confirmation of his talent in such a strong field,” said the six-time Olympian coach.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/anish-bhanwalas-breakthrough-young-shooter-wins-first-senior-world-cup-medal-in-cairo-8463323/,sports
Heartache at Cape Town: BCCI should stop the musical chairs of coaches for Indian women’s cricket team,"Given the youth and the system they come up in, the women's team needs support staff who are technically well equipped and can assist them tactically on the field.","Teary eyes. Face buried into their palms. Folded hands seeking supernatural help. Laughs giving way to grim faces. A few cheers here and there whenever hope shot up. Stunned faces as the familiar heartbreak finale closed in. A collective sigh in the end followed by free-flowing tears. Senior players and support staff once again left quizzing themselves how to pick up the pieces and move on. And a run out that will haunt a lifetime.
This heartache is not new to Women in Blue. From the time they made it to the final of the 50-over World Cup in 2017, where they collapsed near the finish line against England, they have gone through such phases regularly in ICC events. A year later, they lost to England in the T20 World Cup semifinals in the Caribbean; two years later to Australia at Melbourne in the final of the T20 World Cup. Last year, as cricket returned to the Commonwealth Games, they settled for silver losing to Australia in the final in Birmingham.
And now this at Cape Town, where they lost the semifinals by 5 runs to Australia. Like in the case of CWG final and the 2017 World Cup final, India were on course for a statement win – Australia had no answers to Harmanpreet Kaur — only for the unlucky dismissal of their captain to ensure the story repeated itself.

“It’s very difficult to control myself. I don’t know,” Harmanpreet said. “Right now, I am sitting in a hangover. I don’t understand how it is going on. But after this, when we go to the room, we will know how many more days it will take. But I think we played good cricket. That’s all I can say,” she said.
Dropped catches, poor fielding, mix-ups in the middle, failure to close down important moments… all had a role to play in India’s downfall. For a team that aspires to be the powerhouse in women’s cricket, they still have plenty to make up on the field.
It’s vital that India and the BCCI go back to the drawing board and have a vision in place and ensure continuity when it comes to support staff. Last December, with just two months left for the tournament, the BCCI chose to shuffle – the team has had three different head coaches for each of the three last three T20 World Cups. In an internal shuffle that had few signs of coming, Ramesh Powar, who has been the head coach since 2021, was assigned to the men’s wing of the National Cricket Academy.
Hrishikesh Kanitkar who had been handling the men’s Under-19 and A teams along with the senior women’s team as a batting consultant, was put in charge of the team for the T20 World Cup. To assist him, the BCCI had Troy Cooley – a fast bowling coach that the team felt was necessary for South Africa conditions. With Powar not around, and spin being one of their team’s strongest suits, there was none to assist the likes of Deepti Sharma, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Radha Yadav and Devika Vaidya.

Even Sairaj Bahutule, who was earlier in South Africa with the victorious women’s Under-19 team – and whose experience of the conditions could have been handy – was not told to stay back, and instead was seen part of the men’s team in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy which has experienced R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel in the mix.
ADVERTISEMENT
In their most important league match against England, the Indian spinners were out-bowled by their counterparts, and a defeat meant they ended-up playing Australia in the semifinals. For a team that is still in the developmental stage, having a strong support staff is essential and so is continuity in terms of planning.
Make no mistake, this team is not similar to the men’s side, which prefers more of a man-manager than a tactically nuanced coach. Given the youth and the system they come up in, the women’s team needs a bunch of support staff who are technically well equipped and can assist them tactically on the field.
Top teams that regularly vie for top prizes all have continuity in planning and let the process take over. But by constantly changing coaches almost every couple of years, be it the players or the BCCI are not giving themselves a best chance to win. Coaches, like captains and selectors are normally appointed from one 50-over World Cup cycle to another, which includes two T20 World Cups. However, Indian teams, under Mithali Raj and Harmanpreet, seems an exception to it and unsurprisingly continues to pay the price.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/heartache-at-cape-town-bcci-should-stop-the-musical-chairs-of-coaches-for-indian-womens-cricket-team-8463322/,sports
ICC Match Referee gives ‘average’ rating to Jamtha and Kotla tracks,"In Delhi, Australian batters couldn't adjust to the up and down nature of the track on the third day and lost last nine second innings wickets for 52 runs.","The ICC match referee has given “average” rating to both pitches in Nagpur and Delhi, respectively, where India thrashed Australia inside three days to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
The ratings will be uploaded on the ICC website but PTI can confirm that match referee Andy Pycroft hasn’t given any adverse report about the two tracks.
While the Australian media went paranoid about the nature of the Nagpur track where the visitors scored 177 and 91 in both innings, India were able to score 400 in their only innings.
In Delhi, Australian batters couldn’t adjust to the up and down nature of the track on the third day and lost last nine second innings wickets for 52 runs.
While Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja ruled the roost during the two games, an “Average” rating means that no demerit points are awarded to the venue.
There are six distinct classifications — Very Good, Good, Average, Below Average, Poor and Unfit.
Only when a pitch is rated below average, poor or unfit does, it attracts demerit points. The Nagpur venue had once earlier been suspended when an India versus South Africa match ended in two days with ball turning square from first hour.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-match-referee-gives-average-rating-to-jamtha-and-kotla-tracks-8463317/,sports

She scored 52 runs off 34 balls before her bat got stuck while she was taking a run. This was in the 15th over with India at 133. She had joined hands with Jemimah Rodrigues to score a 69-run fourth-wicket to give India a fighting chance.

"‘Do it, or you’re out!’ Bruno Fernandes reveals how Erik ten Hag laid down law to Cristiano Ronaldo and others",Fernandes spoke about the United's boss' my-way-or-the-highway approach even with superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford.,"Midfielder Bruno Fernandes has revealed just how much of a strict disciplinarian Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag can be.
In a conversation with club legend Rio Ferdinand just before Manchester United’s Europa League clash against Barcelona, the Portuguese footballer spoke about the United’s boss’ my-way-or-the-highway approach even with superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford.
“He demands from people that ‘you do it, or you’re out’. You don’t play. Everyone in the beginning was a bit like ‘if a big player doesn’t do what he wants, he will pull him apart or what?’ But he did it many times, he did it with Cristiano (Ronaldo), with Jadon (Sancho), with Marcus (Rashford) also.
“Marcus did something wrong, and the manager just put him out and everyone was like ‘wow’… He demanded there from Rashy ‘you have to be consistent in everything’, not only in your game and your goals and your performance, but off the pitch also,” Fernandes said in an interview on BT Sport.
Clashes with Ten Hag was one of the biggest reasons that led club legend Ronaldo to leave United in the middle of the season. Before his exit, the Portuguese superstar gave an explosive interview where he said: “Yes, I feel betrayed (by Manchester United). Some people don’t want me here not only this year, but last year too.
He also slammed Ten Hag saying: “I don’t have respect for him because he doesn’t show respect for me.”
Manchester United are currently third in the Premier League, with 49 points from 24 games. They’re just three points behind second-placed neighbours Manchester City.

"Indian Open: Yannik Paul tops leaderboard, Baisoya leads the way on good day for Indians",The Indian contingent – used to the challenging nature of the course at the DLF Club in Gurugram – put up an impressive display in the first round of the golf tournament.,"Each of the four top 100 golfers at the Indian Open this year, playing on the tricky terrain of the Gary Player Course of the DLF Golf and Country Club in Gurugram, failed to register a score under par in the first round on Thursday.
In-form Dane Thorbjørn Olesen, fresh off his win at the Thailand Classic, was one over par, and Spain’s Pablo Larrazabal hit a par score of 72. Elsewhere, Scotland’s Robert MacIntrye was two over, and Japan’s Kazuki Higa three over par.
Defending champion Scott Gallacher also had a poor day, finishing five over par, while Team Europe’s Ryder Cup vice-captain, Denmark’s Thomas Bjorn, finished one over.
There were some exceptions – Germany’s Yannik Paul had a brilliant flourish in the end, hitting four successive birdies in the final four holes to top the leaderboard by finishing seven under par. But for the most part, those unfamiliar with this challenging course, struggled.
With testing conditions with the wind picking up in the second half of the day, the experienced Indian contingent were able to take advantage of those struggles.
Honey Baisoya, a regular here given his sponsorship with DLF, was second on the leaderboard by hitting 66 and finishing six under par. The Delhi-based 26-year-old hit eight birdies, but one double bogey – on the 14th hole – which he felt was his only error of the round. “That’s how DLF is, if you make one bad shot, you’re going to come up with a bogey or even a double,” he told media later.
The 16th, 17th, and 18th holes at this course have been spoken about with a fair bit of caution all week. Baisoya, like Paul after him, managed them well, with two pars and a birdie, but warned that it required some attention to detail.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You really need to focus on these three holes in particular,” he said. “. My goal was just to keep the ball in play (smiles), keep it on the center of the green, and get the putts going.”
Course record-holder Shubhankar Sharma was tied-four on the day, after his four under par score was equalled by Angad Cheema. Shubhankar, the highest-ranked Indian in the event, was pleased with his back nine, but regretted some of his early holes.
“Sometimes you don’t make too many mistakes, but even good shots don’t get the result and that happened a couple of times with me on the back nine (front nine for him since he teed-off from the 10th) where I made two bogeys, but I was playing well,” he said.
“The course is playing tough. And as the wind has picked up, it hasn’t been easy.”
ADVERTISEMENT
When asked, Baisoya had a pretty clear-cut response as to why the Indians had succeeded in Gurugram on day one: “Because we play here a lot (laughs). I come here every day. So I play every day on this golf course.”
Eyes were also focused on Manu Gandas, the 26-year-old topper of the PGTI Order of Merit after winning six successive titles last year. Manu got his round off to a solid start, hitting three birdies on the front nine, before falling off to hit 70 and finish two under par.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/golf/indian-open-yannick-paul-tops-leaderboard-baisoya-leads-the-way-on-good-day-for-indians-8463189/,sports

Indian Ravin Jain is new Ferrari F1 team’s head of strategy,Ravin Jain will begin the high-pressure job at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix next weekend.,"Ferrari’s long-serving race strategy engineer Ravin Jain has taken over from Spaniard Inaki Rueda as the head of strategy of the iconic car-maker’s F1 team.
Jain will begin the high-pressure job at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix next weekend. Reports say the Ferrari F1 team management decided to promote Jain following quite a few high-profile errors last season.
Ferrari did well last season with Charles Leclerc finishing second behind title winner Max Verstappen of Red Bull. Their other driver George Russell was fourth. Some of the questionable calls made last year included a bad pit strategy during the Monaco Grand Prix which cost Leclerc a potential win, while at the Brazilian Grand Prix, he was the only driver on intermediate tyres for the start of Qualification 3.
In the backdrop of the two questionable decisions, Ferrari’s new team principal Fred Vasseur, who took over from Mattia Binotto, decided to ease out Rueda from the role and make the Oxford-graduate Indian with a first-class degree in physics, the head of strategy.
Jain joined Scuderia Ferrari in 2017 and, over the last six years, rose to the post of Race Strategy Engineer. Rueda will continue to be a part of the team with a factory-based sporting role at Ferrari’s headquarters in Maranello.

Early this year Vasseur had indicated he would make changes in Ferrari’s strategy team, saying he was in the “process of reviewing everything”.
“We are in the process to review everything. It’s a bit short notice for me, but we’ll have to do some improvement,” Vasseur had said in January this year.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/motor-sport/ravin-jain-india-new-ferrari-f1-teams-head-of-strategy-8463089/,sports
"KL Rahul shouldn’t be singled out for lack of runs, feels Gautam Gambhir","In his last 10 Test innings, Rahul has averaged a dismal 12.5 with not a single score of above 25. His sequence of scores read 8, 10, 12, 22, 23, 10, 2, 20, 17 and 1, raising questions about his place in the playing XI.","Former India opener Gautam Gambhir feels that it is a tad unfair to single out KL Rahul for scathing criticism as every player goes through lean phases in their respective careers.
In his last 10 Test innings, Rahul has averaged a dismal 12.5 with not a single score of above 25. His sequence of scores read 8, 10, 12, 22, 23, 10, 2, 20, 17 and 1, raising questions about his place in the playing XI.
There are strong calls to induct Shubman Gill in playing XI.
“KL Rahul should not be dropped from the Indian side. One should not single out any player. Everyone goes through a lean patch. No one, no cricket pundit or anyone should tell him that he is not doing well and be dropped,” Gambhir told PTI during an interaction on the sidelines of IPL pre-season camp organised by Lucknow Super Giants.
Gambhir is the mentor of LSG and Rahul is the skipper of the same franchise.
The two-time IPL champion former captain of KKR also cited current India captain Rohit Sharma’s example of how he was backed to the hilt by the erstwhile team management so that he is successful in Test cricket. Once Rohit started opening, things looked up for him in traditional format.
“You have to back players who have talent. Look at Rohit Sharma. He also had a lean patch. Look at the way he started his career. He had a late flourish. Compared (earlier times) to how he is performing now. Everyone could see his talent and backed him. Now see the result. He is going great guns. Rahul can do the same,” Gammbhir seemed confident of his abilities.

The southpaw is of the opinion that if the team is winning matches comfortably, there is no point in tinkering with winning combination and single out one player for harsh treatment.
“India is 2-0 up and not 0-2 down. So let’s not axe anyone and appreciate the team’s performance. I think the Indian team management is right in backing KL Rahul. He is a great player. He had scored runs in international cricket.” On the Indian women’s team’s semi-final encounter against Australia in ICC T20 World Cup, Gambhir said: “I think India has got the talent to beat Australia. Obviously, Australia is a good team but I am sure the Indian women’s team has the potential to beat Australia. If you can play those 240 balls better than Australia, then the team can beat them.” While Indian women lost badly to England in a group league match, Gambhir feels that they have been consistent enough.
“I think the Indian team has been very consistent the way they are playing this tournament. Now the occasions should not matter. You know people will talk about the semi-final. ultimately it is not the occasion, it is the contest of the bat and ball,” he added.

Yorkshire confirm data related to racism ‘irretrievably deleted’,"Pakistan-born cricketer Azeem Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire for more than 10 years, had claimed that racism at the club had left him on the brink of suicide.","The Yorkshire County Cricket Club has confirmed that documents related to allegations of racism and its responses to those charges had been “irretrievably deleted”, which could be prejudicial to the interest of the game in the country.
Pakistan-born cricketer Azeem Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire for more than 10 years, had claimed that racism at the club had left him on the brink of suicide. He later deposed before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) in the UK, detailing his ordeal when he was at the club and how institutional racism was rampant there.
Yorkshire removed a majority of its coaching and management staff in the aftermath of the allegations and Lord Kamlesh Patel took over as chairman of the country side and brought about a number of significant changes to counter racism.
“It has been reported in a number of news outlets that, in relation to the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) inquiry, the Club has admitted a charge of deletion of data and documents,” read a statement issued by Yorkshire on Thursday following an uproar in the media over the deleted files.
“After 5 November 2021, it was discovered that emails and documents, both held electronically by the club and in paper copy, had been irretrievably deleted from both servers and laptops and otherwise destroyed.
“The CDC proceedings are ongoing and, as such, we are limited as to what we can say at this time. After a thorough independent investigation it was established that the deletion and destruction of documents date from a time period prior to the appointment of Lord Patel and relate to the allegations of racism and the club’s response to those allegations.” Yorkshire added that it was not certain why and how the deletion happened and who was responsible for the act.
“The Club is not prepared to conjecture publicly as to why this occurred, who was responsible or the motivation for doing so. The ICO was of course informed of the position at the time of discovery, and no further action was taken.” The statement said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had been apprised of the destruction of data, which had said it could be prejudicial to the interests of the game.

“The ECB was also informed of the position, which led to a charge being brought on the basis that the conduct (deletion/destruction) may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket and/or which may bring the ECB and/or the game of cricket into disrepute.

"Warner vows to keep playing till 2024, hopes he can still make Ashes cut",Warner arrived here on Thursday after being ruled out of the remaining two Tests of the four-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India due to a fractured elbow.,"Struggling Australia opener David Warner on Thursday vowed to keep playing white-ball cricket till 2024 if the selectors decided to end his illustrious Test career.
Warner arrived here on Thursday after being ruled out of the remaining two Tests of the four-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India due to a fractured elbow.
Warner struggled in the opening two Tests against India, managing just 1, 10 and 15 in three innings, while he didn’t bat in the second innings of the Delhi Test after being subbed out due to concussion.
“I’ve always said I’m playing to 2024; if the selectors feel that I’m not worthy of my spot (in Tests), then so be it, and I can push on to the white-ball stuff,” Warner told reporters at Sydney Airport here.
The 36-year-old veteran left-hander, however, still has hopes of making the cut for this year’s Ashes tour despite dismal form.
“I’ve got the next 12 months, a lot of cricket’s ahead for the team and if I can keep scoring runs and putting my best foot forward for the team and I can help my spot, it’d be great for the team,” Warner said.
“It’s easy pickings (for critics) when you’re 36 going on 37. I’ve seen it before with the ex-players as well.

“So for me if I’m taking pressure off the rest of the other guys, and no one’s worrying about the rest of the team, I’m happy to do that,” he added.
Warner’s Test career came under the cloud following his prolonged lean patch in the format. He had scored just one Test century in the last three years.
On Wednesday, Australia selector Tony Dodemaide refused to comment on Warner’s Test future and whether he would be considered for Ashes selection.
“We’ll address the Ashes planning (at a later time), but we are committed to picking the best fit and available players for Test series, particularly something as big as the Ashes,” he had said.

"Ind vs Aus: ‘No bitterness around it, that’s an old school mentality,’ says Ashton Agar after being sent back to Australia","Meanwhile, cricket Australia on Thursday named Agar in its squad for the ODI series in India starting on March 17. He is also a part of the team’s plans for the ODI World Cup, scheduled to be held in India, later this year.","Australia all-rounder Ashton Agar was sent back home after being overlooked for the first two Tests in India. The left-arm spinner returned to Perth to play in Western Australia’s next Sheffield Shield game on March 2 and the 50-over Marsh Cup final on March 8.
Agar, who landed in Australia on Wednesday, told reporters that the selectors told him to keep his “chin up and walk tall”. Agar also said that there is no hard feeling or ‘bitterness’ between him and the management.
“There was really clear messaging, they communicated with me and it’s a clear path forward with that message – it’s chin up, walk tall and try to improve. There’s no bitterness around this sort of stuff anymore; that’s an old school mentality. I just try and give as much as I can and help where I can,” he said.
“It’s not an ideal situation, but you just try and make the best of it,” Agar was quoted as saying by news.com.au. “I’m 29 now and have been through plenty of ups and downs in the game. I’m in a fortunate position so it’s nothing that stresses me out too much,” he added.
The spin all-rounder is optimistic and believes that he will eventually be a part of the Australian team.
“I do feel like I am pretty resilient and try and front up every day with a smile on my face and be part of a team,” he said.
“Going to India is really hard, individually it’s hard and it’s bloody hard as a team especially against that team at the moment, they are unbelievable.

Adding on how his attitude has helped him improve his game, the 29-year old said, “I think controlling my attitude has been a strength of mine over the last few years and I am certainly enjoying my cricket a lot more because of that. You definitely bounce back a little quickly from setbacks,” said Agar.

The war-ravaged European nation said it has decided to skip the tournament because of the presence of boxers from Russia and Belarus. Ukraine will not compete in the men’s World Championship as well.

‘He seems to have escaped a bit of attention’: Geoff Lawson takes a dig at Daniel Vettori for Australia’s debacle in Border-Gavaskar Trophy,The former New Zealand captain is Australia's assistant coach and Lawson said he should have more inputs given he was 'great' in slow conditions.,"While the Australian players and captain Pat Cummins have been heavily criticised for failing to put up a fight in the first two Tests against India, former international Geoff Lawson has singled out Daniel Vettori, saying his role in the debacle hasn’t been analysed enough.
The former New Zealand captain is Australia’s assistant coach and Lawson said he should have more inputs given he was ‘great’ in slow conditions.
“The man who’s probably not copping as much as he should is Daniel Vettori who is one of the great left-arm orthodox bowlers in the world, but he should be advising on how we’re going to bowl and how we’re going to play against that sort of bowling,” Lawson told Australian network SEN.

The Australian, a former Pakistan coach, added: “He seems to have escaped a bit of attention here because when I see shots of the dressing room I think, ‘What’s Vettori’s input here, he’s the man who was a great slow ball’. He should perhaps be having more input than most.”
Lawson also questioned Cummins’ lack of leadership, especially on spinning pitches in India. The Australia captain, who has returned home for a short visit and will rejoin the team before the third Test begins on March 1, has come under scrutiny following two big losses.
“Cummo (Cummins) has so little experience captaining on spinning wickets, in the contemporary game your captain plays very little Sheffield Shield, and he certainly doesn’t play on spinning wickets,” Lawson told SEN 1170 Afternoons programme. “So where does he learn to do all the creative and adaptable things you need to do? He doesn’t, he just gets thrown in the deep end and we watch a lot of videos and make decisions.”
Lawson said Cummins’ lack of experience has been one of the reasons Australia haven’t been able to break down India’s lower-order, which has contributed with some crucial runs.

Brazil’s Bellucci retires at age 35 after Rio Open defeat,The 35-year-old Belluci is now preparing to transition into coaching.,"Thomas Bellucci, Brazil’s main flagbearer on the men’s tennis tour for the last decade, has retired after losing in straight sets to sixth-seeded Sebastian Baez 6-3 6-2 in the first round of the Rio Open.
The 35-year-old Belluci is now preparing to transition into coaching.
Bellucci won 200 professional matches in his career, lifted four titles and reached a career-high No. 21 in the ATP rankings. He’s one of the five players to win a set 6-0 against Novak Djokovic on clay. He beat Top 10 players six times in his career, including then No. 4-ranked Andy Murray at the Madrid Open in 2011.
Bellucci turned pro in 2005 at a time his sports hero, three-time French Open champion and former No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten was active. Brazilians had high expectations the younger player could reach as high as Kuerten, but he almost always fell short — often because of injuries.
“(You have) the historic second position among Brazilian male players,” Kuerten said in a video played on the Rio Open arena’s big screen after Bellucci’s last match.
“It is no joke, my boy. I will continue cheering for you. I applaud you and I thank you.” Bellucci played eight finals at the elite level and won titles at Gstaad (2009, 2012), Santiago (2010), and Geneva (2015).
Still, for many years, he developed a love-hate relationship with Brazilian tennis fans who had no one else but him to place the country’s hopes in big tournaments.

“When people expect a lot from you, you feel it. When you have several sports heroes in a country, that is diluted among all the athletes. That’s what we see in Argentina, Spain, the United States. All have many players. In Brazil it was me playing Grand Slams,” Bellucci said in a press conference.
“That wasn’t good for me. I pressured myself a lot to advance in the tournaments.” He currently ranks No. 915 after almost a full year on the sidelines with an injured left knee.

With less than a minute left HeroBears captain, Chiang Yu copped a rough-looking knock to the face from Leopards player Chen Hsiao-jung. The latter tried to retaliate as match officials quickly got involved to separate the players. However, the situation escalated after HeroBears assistant coach Lin Chieh-ho ran onto the field and charged at Chen.
As punches were landed and fists were flung, the game got delayed for more than 20 minutes after the officials went through the footage to decide which players should be penalised.

"England unchanged for second test, Matt Henry set to return for New Zealand","The tourists romped to a 267-run victory in the day-night opening test in Tauranga last weekend on the back of the ""Bazball"" style of cricket they have been playing under Stokes and coach Brendon ""Baz"" McCullum.","England will play the same style with the same team in the second test against New Zealand, skipper Ben Stokes confirmed on Thursday, while the hosts look set to bring Matt Henry into their bowling attack as they try to level up the series.
The tourists romped to a 267-run victory in the day-night opening test in Tauranga last weekend on the back of the “Bazball” style of cricket they have been playing under Stokes and coach Brendon “Baz” McCullum.
Seamers Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Ollie Robinson all played key roles in the win and Stokes said it was a no-brainer to send out the same side at Wellington’s Basin Reserve on Friday after all three had indicated they were good to go.
“It was just a case of seeing how the bowlers pulled up and they’ve all pulled up pretty well so, yeah, unchanged team,” he told reporters.
“It is a fine line between picking your strongest 11 and ensuring that the bowlers that you pick are 100%. It was pretty easy to pick the team once they told me they were ready to go.”
Last week’s victory was a first in a test for England in New Zealand since 2008 and they now have a chance to inflict a first home test series defeat on the Black Caps in six years.
In keeping with the philosophy of “Bazball”, however, Stokes said England would be focusing on playing entertaining cricket rather than the result.
“It would be great to leave here with a 2-0 series win but I don’t think we’ll be looking to go in here to achieve that,” Christchurch-born Stokes added.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I think we’ll be looking to play the exact same cricket we’ve been playing the last 10 to 12 months and if New Zealand are better than us this week, then we’ll be able to say that.”
New Zealand skipper Tim Southee has made it clear his side will be glad to be back playing red ball cricket this week after being thoroughly out-strategised by England in the pink ball match at Bay Oval.
The seamer added that New Zealand were highly unlikely to try and copy England’s aggressive style of play in the second and final test in Wellington.
“You’ve got to look at your side and try and work with what you’ve got,” he told reporters.
ADVERTISEMENT
“That works for England because of the makeup of their side but it’s about us finding a way that works for us.
“We know these conditions reasonably well and I guess that’s where your home advantage comes into it.”
Home advantage in test cricket usually includes the preparation of the wicket, although Stokes noted that former New Zealand test captain McCullum would have a fair idea of what the grassy track at the Basin Reserve might serve up.
Southee said there was unlikely to be any change to a New Zealand top order that got poor returns in Tauranga but that seamer Henry, who missed the first test because of the birth of his first child, would probably come back into the side.

Saudi Arabia’s Founding Day is celebrated on February 22 every year to commemorate the country’s founding by Imam Mohammed bin Saud in 1727. It was declared a national holiday last year following a royal decree by King Salman.
Ronaldo came to Al-Nassr earlier this year. In November last year, his former club Manchester United terminated the Portuguese striker’s contract. His acrimonious exit was on the cards after his explosive interview with Piers Morgan.
In his interview, Ronaldo has blasted Manchester United and manager Erik ten Hag in an incendiary TV interview, saying he feels “betrayed” by the club and that senior figures have tried to force him out of Old Trafford.
When asked on the program “Piers Morgan Uncensored” whether United’s hierarchy was trying to force him out of the club, Ronaldo said: “Yes, not only the coach, but another two or three guys around the club. I felt betrayed.”
When quizzed again if senior club executives were trying to oust him, the 37-year-old Portugal star said: “I don’t care. People should listen to the truth.

"Carlos Alcaraz wins at Rio Open, eyes race with Novak Djokovic for No.1","The 19-year-old defending champion closed out the last two games of a match suspended the previous day because of rain to complete a 6-4, 6-4 win over Mateus Alves.","Top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz advanced to the second round of the Rio Open on Wednesday, with his mind already set for a year-long contest with Novak Djokovic for the No. 1 ranking.
The 19-year-old defending champion closed out the last two games of a match suspended the previous day because of rain to complete a 6-4, 6-4 win over Mateus Alves.
Alcaraz will next play Fabio Fognini, who beat Tomas Barrios Vera 6-2, 6-3 at the clay court tournament.
The Spanish teenager was sidelined for four months with a leg muscle injury and returned to the tour last week at the Argentina Open, where he dropped only one set en route to his first title since his Grand Slam breakthrough at the U.S. Open last year.
Alcaraz, who in 2021 became the first teenage year-end No. 1 in ATP history, is currently No. 2 in the rankings. He said he doesn’t feel pressure to topple Djokovic from the top but has set that as a key goal for 2023.

“Truth is a beautiful year awaits, with beautiful tournaments. It is true there will be a little pressure to defend important titles. I will have to play at a good level but, as I always say, I play every match thinking I have to enjoy it, much beyond the results,” Alcaraz told a news conference. “I have to try to win more Grand Slam titles, reclaim the No. 1 position. That’s what I am hoping for this year.”
The hottest up-and-coming player on tour has titles to defend in Rio, Miami, Barcelona, Madrid and in the last major of the season in New York.
Alcaraz struggled at times against Alves, a Brazilian ranked No. 556 . He needed almost two hours of play to win, saying he’d only seen videos of his 22-year-old rival before their match.

“It is not easy to stop after an entire match and have to start it again the next day,” Alcaraz said. “I feel I am doing well after four months injured. I had a very good week in Argentina and I am coming here with a lot of confidence.”

Opener Warner was concussed and suffered an elbow fracture when batting in the second Test, while Agar was sent home to play domestic cricket after being nudged down the pecking order of spinners by Todd Murphy and Matthew Kuhnemann.

Pat Cummins, who also flew home from India after the drubbing in Delhi because of a family illness, will captain the team in a series that will help Australia prepare for the World Cup in India later this year.
All-rounder Cameron Green and left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc were also included in the squad in anticipation of their recovery from the broken fingers which prevented them from playing in the first two tests.
Paceman Josh Hazlewood was left out to allow him to recover from an Achilles injury that also prevented him from playing any part in the test series. “It would be great for Josh to be part of this series but we have taken a conservative view ahead of a very important winter in England of which he will be an integral part,” said chief selector George Bailey.
Jhye Richardson will bolster the fast-bowling stocks after recovering from a hamstring injury.
Marsh, who is recovering from an ankle injury, is expected to play two domestic matches for Western Australia before heading to India, while Maxwell has already made his return from a broken leg with Victoria’s state team.

Government proposes regulator to oversee English soccer,It comes in response to the failed attempts of 12 of Europe’s elite clubs including six from England’s Premier League to set up a European Super League in 2021. The English clubs quickly shelved the idea after a backlash from fans and the government.,"A government plan would allow English soccer to be overseen by an independent regulator to ensure the financial sustainability of clubs throughout the leagues and stop teams from joining breakaway competitions like the European Super League.
In what is described as a “radical transformation of the rules governing how football is run in England,” the British government is acting on a recommendation from a fan-led review carried out in the wake of the collapse of two lower-league clubs — Bury and Macclesfield — because of financial mismanagement.
It also comes in response to the failed attempts of 12 of Europe’s elite clubs — including six from England’s Premier League — to set up a European Super League in 2021. The English clubs quickly shelved the idea after a backlash from fans and the government.
The government on Thursday will publish its “white paper on football governance” which will propose the creation of a regulator for the elite men’s game to implement a new licensing system from the Premier League down to the fifth tier. It would require clubs to “demonstrate sound financial business models and good corporate governance as part of an application process before being allowed to compete.”
It would give fans a greater say in the running of clubs, such as changing names or colors of the jersey, and require clubs to seek approval from the regulator for any sale or relocation of a stadium.
It would have the power to prevent English clubs from joining new competitions that do not meet predetermined criteria, in consultation with the Football Association and fans.
“That criteria could include measures to stop clubs participating in closed-shop breakaway competitions which harm the domestic game,” the government said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The regulator would also run an owners’ and directors’ test with a focus on the fitness and propriety of new owners and enhanced due diligence. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any human-rights element to the test, which Amnesty International has called on the Premier League to introduce in the wake of the Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle and has repeated amid a Qatari bid for Manchester United.
The government is confident the regulator’s powers would be balanced in such a way that it will not diminish the competitiveness and strength of the Premier League, which is financially superior to every other league in Europe.
According to the government, the regulator would have “targeted powers of last resort” to intervene “as and when necessary.”
The Premier League said its clubs “will now carefully consider the government’s plan for England to become the first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Premier League stressed it was “vital that regulation does not damage the game fans love to watch in the deepest professional pyramid in the world, or its ability to attract investment and grow interest in our game.”
It warned of “unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League’s position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivaled levels of funding we provide at risk.”
The government said it will now embark on further consultation with the key stakeholders.

Tricky course may present an opportunity to locals as Indian Open returns to Gurugram,"India’s marquee men’s golf event kicks off at the DLF Golf and Country Club on Thursday, on a course that has divided the pros that have played on it in the past","When answering a question from a fan on Twitter back in 2018, former World No. 33 Eddie Pepperell said the course at the DLF Golf and Country Club in Gurugram was “designed by Satan”.
After a four-year-long COVID-induced break, India’s national golf championship – the $2 million Hero Indian Open – returns to that course on Thursday. Ever since it debuted on the DP World (formerly ‘European’) Tour in 2017, the course has been the major talking point of the event.
You’re right Ian I didn’t enter as never planned to play them. Tshwane out of protest for not getting in last year (🤣) and India because, well, that course was designed by Satan. https://t.co/JSb1Nf2VeG
— Eddie Pepperell (@PepperellEddie) March 1, 2018
Even some of the more seasoned pros have struggled in Gurugram in the past: the big man-made lakes require tight driving, the foam-facing bunkering needs an excellent wedge game, and the fast greens and tricky rough do not usually allow low scores.
Courses as challenging as this usually make top golfers look a bit clueless – and there is a point to be made whether that is self-defeating for the sport in the first place.
Nevertheless, those that have made their way back to the venue this year know full well that the challenging nature of the course – in particular the final three holes – can cause some unpredictable results. Denmark’s Thorbjørn Olesen, fresh off his win at the Thailand Classic last week, is wary of letting his form make him complacent.
“I think all the guys have said a lot about the golf course and what you need to do and it’s going to be a different week,” he told media on Tuesday. “The 16th, 17th and 18th, which is like an uphill climb and has the waterfall – I haven’t played it yet.”
Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre, who joins his countryman and defending champion (2019) Scott Gallacher in the field, aced the 16th hole in practice, but explained just how challenging the back three might be.
“I’ve heard a lot of stories about how difficult and almost wild it is. I played the back nine today and stood on the 15th and thought: ‘This is alright here, we can deal with this’, and then the last three and a half holes blew my mind a little bit,” he said. “It’s a mental test rather than a test of your golf game.”

This may just present an opportunity to a strong Indian contingent in Gurugram this week, many of whom playing on the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) being well-versed with the course.
Anirban Lahiri, champion in 2015 who has joined LIV Golf – the Saudi-backed upstart league that has disrupted the sport’s status quo, and remains one of the big talking points this week in Gurugram – chose to skip the event. But veteran SSP Chawrasia – who won the second of his two Indian Open titles (2016, 2017) at the DLF Club – will be in the field.
The 26-year-old talent Manu Gandas, the PGTI’s Order of Merit topper thanks to which he now has a full card for the DP World Tour, will also play, and so will Arjuna Awardee Shubhankar Sharma.
Sharma, who became the youngest Indian to win a European Tour title five years ago, believes the course he has played on since childhood is now a lot more playable, and has matured since 2019.

“It’s a tough course, one of the more challenging ones on the whole tour,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “All the players are talking about the last three holes because they are very hard finishing holes. Especially knowing where the wind is coming from, if it picks up. But that’s what makes it exciting, because it is not over until the final hole here.”
“Some of the Indians have played more regularly here, so that will help them and serve them well,” he said. “But I expect the top pros who have been in good touch, to be in and around the leaderboard. They will know how to adapt quickly.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/golf/tricky-course-may-present-an-opportunity-to-locals-as-indian-open-returns-to-gurugram-8461308/,sports

"Citing complaint against Brij Bhushan, UWW moves Asian wrestling event out of India",Asian Championships to be held in New Delhi from March 28 to have a new host.,"India is set to lose the hosting rights of the Asian Wrestling Championship in the aftermath of the allegations of sexual harassment against the Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, and the ongoing investigation into the claims.
The United World Wrestling (UWW) has conveyed the possibility of this to the government-appointed oversight committee during a meeting on Wednesday while rejecting their request for a postponement of the event.
The Asian Championships were scheduled to take place in New Delhi from March 28 to April 2, with the deadline for entries set at February 28.
The oversight committee, it is learnt, had earlier this month requested the UWW to postpone the Championship by a few days since it was scheduled in close proximity to the women’s boxing World Championship. Both tournaments were to be held in the same complex – Delhi’s Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium.
The UWW, it is learnt, was considering the request and was open to postponing the Asian Championship by up to a month. Eventually, though, they decided against it.
It is learnt that the UWW cited a written complaint it has received against Sharan from the wrestlers as one of the reasons. However, the content of the complaint wasn’t disclosed. The world body also pointed out the ongoing probe, which is likely to take at least two more weeks, and the government’s decision to suspend the activities of WFI as the other reasons for their decision.
The UWW, however, has assured that Indian wrestlers will be able to take part in the rescheduled Asian Championship, the host of which is likely to be finalised in the coming days.
ADVERTISEMENT
The decision comes a month after India’s Olympic and World Championship medal winners, including the likes of Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, accused Sharan of sexually harassing women wrestlers and staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi demanding his removal.
The government, after several meetings, decided to set up an oversight committee headed by Olympic medalist MC Mary Kom to probe the allegations. The committee was mandated to complete their probe within four weeks but the delay in finalising the names and the vast scope of work means it is likely to take more time than initially anticipated.
The continental event would have been the first international wrestling tournament to be held in the country since the pandemic and most top wrestlers were expected to take part in it.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/citing-complaint-against-brij-bhushan-uww-moves-asian-wrestling-event-out-of-india-8461305/,sports

Women’s T20 World Cup: India face ultimate test against Australia in semifinals,"Harmanpreet & Co have followed the expected script till now, but need to raise their level considerably if they are to upstage Meg Lanning’s Aussies.","Here they are. The semifinals, a stage where many expected India to be at the start of the Women’s T20 World Cup, and facing an opposition that many fear would eventually end their run – Australia. If there was any script, it has been followed to the T with a bit of course correction here and there. But largely, India’s campaign has panned out exactly the way the team didn’t want it to.
Given the format of the T20 World Cup, reaching the semifinals was always a given for India. In a 10-team tournament involving two groups of five each, all it needed was three wins to get this far and given the squad at their disposal, they managed it successfully beating Pakistan, West Indies and Ireland. Had they defeated England, they could have avoided facing Australia in the semifinals, but that match was a stark indicator of where the team stands right now.

"Farmer’s son from Pachera village in Madhya Pradesh qualifies for equestrian at Asian Games, a sport dominated by army men and the affluent","Raju Singh Bhadoriya was introduced the sport of equestrian when he accompanied his uncle, a horse groomer, to the Madhya Pradesh Equestrian Academy in Bhopal.","In the backdrop of a towering South Mumbai skyline shrouded in smog, Raju Singh Bhadoriya clucks and pats a horse that’s bucking and refusing to cooperate. The mare’s head is bowed down, low to the ground. And she wouldn’t do what her rider wants her to do.
‘Steady’, Bhadoriya leans forward and whispers as he signals her to move forward. She, however, doesn’t oblige and tries to throw him off the saddle, instead. The 17-year-old rider, though, stays calm and continues to pat, constantly whispering the words ‘steady’ and ‘move’ while pointing forward until the horse gets into her stride and lopes around the jumping arena of the Mahalaxmi Race Course.

A target of 180 would be good as Australia bat deep: Richa Ghosh,"Although India lost the five-match series 1-4 in December, the scoreline did not do justice to how hard the 'Women in Blue' pushed the world's top-ranked team across the five games.","India would need to put up at least 180 on board to challenge the depth of Australian batting line-up in the Women’s T20 World Cup semi-final, feels star keeper-batter Richa Ghosh.
Although India lost the five-match series 1-4 in December, the scoreline did not do justice to how hard the ‘Women in Blue’ pushed the world’s top-ranked team across the five games. And once again Harmanpreet Kaur and Co. are aiming to do the same.
“Australia is comfortable chasing because they bat deep, we do too, but toss is not in anyone’s hand. So whatever the situation, we will have to go through with it. We have plans,” Ghosh, India’s best finisher by a distance, said on the eve of the semi-finals against Southern Stars.
“We don’t know how the pitch will behave tomorrow but it looks nice. We can target 180 on this if all our batters click and while bowling we will try to restrict them to 140-150 because they have a good batting line up,” Ghosh said.
In Ghosh, India has unearthed a much-needed finisher and the youngster hasn’t disappointed. Talking about her game, she said: “There are ups and downs always, even I had them but have learnt a lot from there,how you can handle a situation. When I go to bat, my handling of pressure has improved.” Australia has been India’s bogey team in recent years but Ghosh is confident that Meg Lanning’s team is a beatable one. Australia have been a dominant force in the format since winning the last edition in 2020 at home.
In the last 22 months, Australia have lost just one T20I and that defeat came against India away from home via a Super Over. The five-time champions are unbeaten in tournament so far, having won all their group stage matches.
“Australia are beatable, in the our last series we beat them and we have also done it before. They are a strong team but we can beat them,” Ghosh stated.

“We are trying to improve our mindset. Everyone has the game but the team that is mentally strong will win. We have been working on that,” said Ghosh.

Having played in a five-match series in December, the U-19 World Cup-winning teenager said that India plan to exploit Australia’s weaknesses.
“We know the weak spot of Australia and we are planning against it but I will not say what that (weakness) is because then they will come prepared.” The hard-hitting Ghosh, who has hit two half-centuries in the tournament and is the team’s leading run-scorer, said India will play an attacking game similar to Australia on Thursday.
“They attack a lot. So, whatever happens to them, even if the batter is out, they don’t leave the attacking. Because they have batters from top to bottom. We also have batter from top to bottom. So, we will play an attacking game.” Ghosh feels beating Australia will be a “huge confidence booster” heading in to the final.

‘I don’t think you can come and replicate what they do. Nathan Lyon is not R Ashwin’: Ian Chappell,Ashwin and Jadeja have picked a total of 31 wickets between them in the first two Tests and together share 130 scalps against Australia in the 10 Tests.,"Former Australia captain turned broadcaster Ian Chappell believes the Australian spinners shouldn’t try and replicate the Indian spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, despite their methods being extremely successful early in the four match series.
“Too often they (opposition spinners) do try and replicate the skillset (of Ashwin and Jadeja). Talking about Ashwin and Jadeja… They know exactly what to do in India. Ashwin is a damn fine bowler, doesn’t matter where he bowls. I’ve seen him bowl in Australia, he bowled extremely well. He is also very smart. He works out exactly what he’s gotta do. Jadeja doesn’t vary too much although he has learned a few things and has improved his bowling but he’s got the skillset that is perfect for India and the two of them work together,” Chappell told ESPNCricinfo.

England’s evergreen Anderson back on top of ICC Test Rankings,At 40 years and 207 days Anderson has knocked Australian paceman Pat Cummins off his four-year perch to become the oldest player to top the ICC test rankings.,"Like a fine wine England bowler James Anderson appears to be improving with age and the 40-year-old seamer is back on top of the International Cricket Council test rankings for the sixth time in his illustrious career.
At 40 years and 207 days Anderson has knocked Australian paceman Pat Cummins off his four-year perch to become the oldest player to top the ICC test rankings.
Anderson, who has taken more test wickets than any other fast bowler in history, played a key role in England’s 267-run victory over New Zealand in last week’s first test in Mount Maunganui, England’s 10th win in 11 tests.
His seven wickets took his career total to 682 and for the first time since his maiden series in 2003 his average is now below 26. Anderson shows no sign of losing his edge either and since he turned 35 he has taken 202 wickets in 56 tests at a miserly average of 20.56.

But Maria Jose Rojas scored in the 11th minute of stoppage time to keep Chile’s hopes alive and make the final moments nerve-wracking for Haiti’s Les Grenadiers, who held on to claim an historic victory.
Players shed tears of joy when the final whistle blew, reflecting on success attained in the most difficult of circumstances.
Haiti’s Les Grenadiers had to win two matches in New Zealand to qualify for their first World Cup. They beat Senegal 4-0 in their opening match and then beat 38th-ranked Chile for their first ever win over a South American opponent.
Prior to the tournament midfielder Danielle Etienne told ESPN “there’s a lot of unhappiness in the country and football is the joy.” “Being able to qualify to the World Cup would be major,” she said at the time. “We want that for the country as a whole, to have a breath of fresh air and kind of step aside from anything going on.” While Portugal’s win was sealed late it came at the end of a dominant performance.

Patchy India will have to lift their game against unforgiving Australia,"India, who have been among the top teams over the last five years but unable to win a major trophy, have expectedly made the semifinals of another ICC event.","Having put up a patchy performance in the Women’s T20 World Cup thus far, India will have to lift their game drastically against nemesis Australia in the first semifinal on Thursday.
India, who have been among the top teams over the last five years but unable to win a major trophy, have expectedly made the semifinals of another ICC event.
However, they have been guilty of self-destructing in the past especially in a knock-out game against England or Australia.
Australia beat India in the previousT20 World Cup final at home and more recently at Commonwealth Games gold medal match in Birmingham last year.
Women’s cricket in India has grown massively since the final appearance at the ODI World Cup in 2017 and now it is high time the team converts its promise into performance by stepping up in a do-or-die game like the one on Thursday.
Though the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side won three of its four games in the group stage, not one performance could be called convincing including the game against Ireland. Their sole loss came against England.
Considering the way India have played so far, one can only hope that somehow they are able to fix all their issues for the big game, whether it is the inconsistent top-order, the inability to hit sixes barring Richa Ghosh or the high dot ball percentage.
ADVERTISEMENT
Opener Shafali Verma made her international debut more than three years ago and though still a teenager, she has not been able to learn from her mistakes, mainly her inability to rotate the strike and her susceptibility against the short ball.
Skipper Harmanpreet herself will be under tremendous pressure to perform having not done anything of note so far in the World Cup. She is one of the few batters who can hit the ball long but has been inconsistent for far too long.
Another loss in a World Cup knock-out game could end her captaincy tenure.
Jemimah Rodrigues has done alright in the tournament but needs to do more to help the team’s cause.
ADVERTISEMENT
Star batter Smriti Mandhana has been among the consistent performers and once again she will be critical to the team’s chances against Australia, who are known to raise their game in a big game to ‘invincible levels’.
The Meg Lanning-led side would be carrying a 22-match T20 winning streak into the semifinal.
Australia have lost just two official matches in any format since dropping a T20 game to New Zealand in March 2021, but notably, both of those defeats have come against India. In December, they outplayed India 4-1 in the series played in Mumbai.
In the bowling department, pacer Renuka Thakur has been India’s best bowler in the event with seven wickets so far, including a five for 15 against England.
ADVERTISEMENT
Deepti Sharma went for runs in her one over against Ireland, but she has been the most consistent in the spin department. The likes of Pooja Vastrakar, Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Radha Yadav will have to be much more accurate against the rampaging Aussies.
Australia opener Betth Mooney is wary of India’s challenge though going by past results, they should win comfortably.
“I’m expecting it to be a huge contest, they’ve pushed us significantly in the last few years, and they have a bunch of match winners in that line-up as well,” Mooney told reporters here on Tuesday.
“We’re not expecting it to be easy by any means, whether it’s with a bat or the ball, but we certainly know the style of play they’ve come at us with in the past and they know ours pretty well, too.” Harmanpreet said though her team lost the home series, the players got a lot of confidence out of the high scoring five games.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I think that series gave us a lot of confidence, you know, the brand of cricket we played in that particular series was something which gave us a lot of confidence.
“And now we know them very well. We played five games back-to-back and then one practice game, we know, their strength, their weakness.” Although wicket-keeper Alyssa Healy missed Australia’s final group game against South Africa with quad soreness, the opener is fit for Thursday’s match.

He then said, “It’s just hard times for the whole region so helping out neighbours and whoever we could. It’s been tough, it’s really tough at the moment, but Hawke’s Bay is staying strong. Obviously, I grew up there as a kid … it’s just crazy to be honest. It’s a bit hard to talk about, really.”
Even though the Black Caps went down to England in the first Test, Tickner bagged four wickets on his debut and was given a slim bit of happiness when his father was able to catch his first ever Test wicket, before heading out to help families stricken by the cyclone.
“You dream about your test debut forever and expect your family to be there … my dad was good enough to come through, taking generators down to Hawke’s Bay to help people,” Tickner said.
“He just stopped in for about half an hour, luckily saw my first test wicket and then went on to a seven-hour drive home to help everyone,” said Tickner.
New Zealand cricket has teamed up with ANZ for a special fundraiser when the Kiwis face Sri Lanka in an ODI on March 25th at Eden Park. ANZ also promised a $1 million donation to the New Zealand Red Cross Disaster Fund.

"‘Egyptian pyramids aren’t man-made, Earth could be flat and used to watch Logan Paul half naked’: Nick Kyrigos in his wildest podcast","In a maundering conversation that involved Tennis, Egyptian Pyramids, Will Smith, Australian fans and more, the Canberra native revealed startling facts about himself, his career and life experiences.","Australian Tennis star Nick Kyrgios on Wednesday revealed that if he had won the 2022 Wimbledon final, he would have retired from the sport.
The 27-year-old tennis star appeared on boxer and Youtuber Logan Paul’s ‘Impaulsive’ podcast and said ‘That was my chance. That was really my chance. If I’d honestly won that, I think I would have retired at least for a year or two,” he said of his Wimbledon loss.
“I think I can win a grand slam. Wimbledon I was right there. I was two sets away. I won the first set and I thought this is it. And then I just didn’t stay in the moment and he stayed super composed.”
“I feel like I could do that. It’s weird, but I feel like it’s not even for me though. I feel like it’s for everyone else. All the haters as well. I could finally just rest. I could just go home and sleep in my bed and not deal with the s***.”
In a maundering conversation that involved Tennis, Egyptian Pyramids, Will Smith, Australian fans and more, the Canberra native revealed startling facts about himself, his career and life experiences.
The star tennis player, who is currently under rehabilitation, revealed that he doesn’t believe the Egyptian pyramids are man-made, the Earth could be flat and that he used to watch Logan Paul half naked in the wildest interview of his career.
When the hosts asked him about his interactions with celebrity fans, Kyrigos talked about his meeting with Will Smith. “Will Smith was a big one for me…he watched me courtside at the Australian Open. He was my favourite actor at that time for sure…I was real nervous and then I won and met him straight after that…that was a cool moment.”

The Aussie star also revealed that popstar Drake messaged him after the Wimbledon and that Jack Harlow and he talk time to time.
“It’s just crazy. I’m not supposed to be here,” Kyrigos said as he recalled the moments.
“Even here. I can’t believe I’m doing this right now to be honest. I’d watch you guys on TikTok in my bed like half naked in my bed. And now I’m sitting here,” he added.
On the ancient Egypt pyramids, Kyrigos said, “I don’t think the pyramids are man-made,” he said.

‘The doors are pretty big, and we as humans don’t need doors as big as those ones,” he added.
As the conversation went on, the focus shifted to who the greatest tennis player of all time was. Comparing Roger Federer to Michael Jordan he said, “Federer and Jordan are very similar, but I think Novak (Djokovic) is statistically better.”
When the hosts asked the Aussie if tennis players from the past, like Pete Sampras, John McEnroe and Andre Agassi, were in the conversation, shaking his head, “No way,” Kyrgios said.

IPL 2023: Mukesh Ambani streams Indian Premier League games for free after paying $2.7 Billion,"Viacom18 Media Pvt., the joint venture between Paramount Global and Ambani’s conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd., licensed the IPL streaming rights last year for $2.7 billion","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate will stream Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket games for free, according to people familiar with the matter, using its exclusive rights to one of the world’s most-watched sporting events to challenge Walt Disney Co. and Amazon.com Inc. in India’s booming media market. Viacom18 Media Pvt., the joint venture between Paramount Global and Ambani’s conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd., licensed the IPL streaming rights last year for $2.7 billion, fending off competitors Disney and Sony Group Corp. Disney previously had those rights, and used them to drive subscribers to its streaming service, Disney+ Hotstar.
Viacom18 is taking a different approach, offering the games to as many people as possible in order to generate advertising sales, said the people, who declined to be identified because the move hasn’t been announced publicly. Free media services such as Google and Facebook generate billions of dollars in advertising sales in the country, and have had far more success than paid premium products like Netflix.

Emiliano Martinez details tough return from World Cup; speaks about staying in bed for 14-15 hours,"Since his return to England, Martinez, who currently plays with Aston Villa, found out just how much he had sacrificed to push Argentina to their World Cup triumph.","Emiliano Martinez lit up the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar with some breath-taking performances that kept Argentina alive in the tournament at various points. His goalkeeping and passion was the lifeblood of a team that was trying to win a World Cup for Lionel Messi. But the effort of that monumental feat has had its effects as well.
Since his return to England, Martinez, who currently plays with Aston Villa, found out just how much he had sacrificed to push Argentina to their World Cup triumph.
“I returned to Great Britain and slept 14-15 hours a night. I only needed 7-8 hours of sleep. That’s when I saw how much adrenaline… what it cost me to return,” explained the Aston Villa goalkeeper in an interview to Sky Sports.
Since those performances at the World Cup, Martinez’s stock has steadily risen. There are reports that clubs like Inter Milan, Juventus and Tottenham are chasing his signature while the goalkeeper himself now holds the goal of winning a Champions League.
“At various times I thought that I was not good enough and that I was not going to be the goalkeeper that I always dreamed of being. I always had the talent from a very young age and I came to one of the biggest clubs in England. To have a successful career and to be Argentina’s number 1, that was my goal. I never dreamed of winning the World Cup or the Champions League.”
Despite the upward tick in his career, Martinez’s relationship with Aston Villa coach Unai Emery is not at its best at the moment. Emery was critical of Martinez recently after the goalkeeper went forward late in injury time when his team was down 3-2 to Arsenal and then was not in position when Arsenal scored their fourth.
“Today I am very disappointed and it is embarrassing for me, the last goal. Because I never told my goalkeeper to go to a corner to score a goal. It is not the spirit, we have to keep our mind clear and smart,” said Emery to BBC Sport after the match.

Emery continued the rant against Martinez and added, “But then on the pitch after scoring first we were thinking when will the match finish. You have to play 90 minutes.

"Liverpool unlock dubious record, concede 5 goals for the first time at Anfield in a Champions League match",This was also the first time that the Anfield outfit has conceded four goals at their home in the Champions League.,"Liverpool’s season suffered an almighty setback after the high of back-to-back Premier League wins was wiped out as they conceded 5 goals for the first time ever at Anfield on a Champions League night in their match against defending champions Real Madrid.
Liverpool, who were initially cruising against the Los Blancos with two early strikes from Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah, folded like a pack of cards after failing to deal with Madrid’s snappy passing and attacking intent. Vinicius Junior would score twice before half time to drag the sides level while Eder Militao’s unmarked headed goal just after half time would go a long way in breaking The Reds’ spirits.
A double whammy from Real’s mercurial striker Karim Benzema would follow and Real ended up taking a 3-goal cushion into the second leg of their fortress Santiago Bernabeau. Barring a miracle like the one they did against Barcelona in the 2019 season, Liverpool are staring at an early exit from the Champions League this season.

This was also the first time that the Anfield outfit has conceded four goals at their home in the Champions League. To make matters worse, Jurgen Klopp’s men now hold the dubious honour of being the first team in UCL history to take a 2-0 lead and then crash to a 3-goal defeat.

Roberto Firmino’s 70th minute header was the only shot on target for Liverpool in the second half, a stat which perhaps reflects the Merseysiders’ lack of dominance in the final 45 minutes.
However, there was something positive to take away from underneath the rubble of this humble defeat.

South Africa reach Women’s T20 World Cup semifinals after beating Bangladesh,"The Proteas finished second in Group 1, behind defending champions Australia who won all their four matches.","Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits struck unbeaten half centuries during their unconquered 117-run opening partnership as South Africa thrashed Bangladesh by 10 wickets to reach the semifinals of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup.
The Proteas finished second in Group 1, behind defending champions Australia who won all their four matches.
South Africa, New Zealand and Sri Lanka ended their group engagements on four points each. But the hosts made it to the semifinals as they have the best net run rate of +0.738 among the three teams.
View this post on Instagram
A post shared by ICC (@icc)
New Zealand and Sri Lanka have NRR of +0.138 and – 1.460 respectively.
The Sune Luus-led side, thus, became the first South African team male or female, junior or senior to reach the final four of a major ICC event staged on their soil.
South Africa play Group 2 toppers England who are unbeaten so far in the second semifinal here on Friday.
Wolvaardt (66 not out off 56 balls) and Brits (50 not out off 51 balls) struck their team’s first half-centuries of the tournament as South Africa overhaul Bangladesh’s 114-run target with 13 balls to spare, reaching 117 for no loss in 17.5 overs on Tuesday.
Bangladesh opted to bat and the Proteas struck twice in the powerplay, with Murshida Khatun chipping Marizanne Kapp to mid-on for a six-ball duck and Shamima then skying Shabnim Ismail to midwicket.

From 22 for two, skipper Nigar Sultana Joty and Sobhana Mostary carefully rebuilt the innings and rotated strike nicely without peppering the boundary.
Sobhana was dropped by Brits on 25 but the third-wicket stand was snapped at 33 when she missed a slog sweep across the line and Nonkululeko Mlaba hit the stumps.
The 16-year-old Shorna Akter showcased her talent by lofting Mlaba over mid-off but soon departed when she was yorked by Ayabonga Khaka at 81 for four.
Kapp came back and showed her class with a slower ball that got the big wicket of Nigar Sultana, comprehensively bowled for 30.

Khaka repeated the yorker trick to get rid of Fargana Hoque but as the Proteas began to tire in the field, Bangladesh inched their way up to 113 for six.
South Africa’s reply was a fraught affair from the very start.
Nine runs came from the first four overs, Brits was dropped by Sobhana and Wolvaardt somehow survived a mix-up in the middle.
Wolvaardt hit a towering six over mid-on but Brits only survived thanks to Shamima missing two stumping chances off the spinners as they crawled to 43 for no loss from 10 overs.

The pressure gradually eased and the much-needed big overs eventually came.

Vidit Gujrathi hands Magnus Carlsen 1st loss of Chess Pro League,Magnus Carlsen bangs his desk in frustration as he misses a checkmate to lose to Vidit Gujrathi as India Yogis beat Canada Chess Brahs,"In what was an upset of all upsets, India’s chess Grandmaster Vidit Gujrathi –playing for Indian Yogis – notched up the biggest win of his career, beating five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen – playing for Canada Chess Brahs – in a Pro Chess League encounter on Tuesday.
What’s even more impressive is that the 28-year-old India managed the feat playing with black pieces.
Carlsen seemed absolutely frustrated with the loss, banging his desk in despair.
Staring down the barrel of a 5.5-6.5 deficit, the Yogis clutched up with a 4-0 final round drubbing over the Canada Chessbrahs where Gujrathi overcame Carlsen after the latter missed a checkmate in three.
An ecstatic Vidit said after the game: “We fought very hard, and I think the cherry on top for me was for sure to defeat Magnus.”
Just defeated the GOAT, World champion, Magnus Carlsen!! :) https://t.co/Ym2w6svF6K
— Vidit Gujrathi (@viditchess) February 21, 2023
The Yogis named a team with an average age of 21, hoping to utilize their prodigies to take points from the popular Chessbrahs.
The GM Aman Hambleton-led Chessbrahs started with a bang and won their first round 2.5-1.5 and second with a 3-1 score. GM Razvan Preotu once again proved to be a valuable asset after winning his opening games against GMs Raunak Sadhwani and Vidit respectively.
GM Aryan Tari also started strongly and defeated IM Vaishali Rameshbabu in round two after taking advantage of a superior pawn structure
Within reach of a match win with a round to spare, the Chessbrahs set out to gain the three points required to secure the win. Despite Carlsen making a statement with a 21-move miniature on board one with the black pieces against Sadhwani, the Yogis managed to flip the momentum and win 3-1.

Vidit’s win over Tari was crucial for the Yogis. The Yogis rode the wave of momentum heading into the fourth round and bamboozled the Chessbrahs with a remarkable 4-0 score that pushed them to a match-winning 9.5-6.5.

"Liverpool vs Real Madrid: ‘I think I’d take his place at the moment’, says Jamie Carragher on Virgil Van Djik",Former Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher hits back at Virgil Van Djik’s statement from two months ago after the defender presides over 2-5 loss to Madrid at Anfield.,"Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher blasted Jurgen Klopp’s team after a capitulation to Real Madrid at Anfield saw them lose 2-5 in the Champions League Round-of-16 first leg tie. Liverpool were leading by two goals within the first 20 minutes of the game. An audacious finish by Darwin Nunez, followed by a comical blunder by Madrid No 1 Thibaut Courtois gave Liverpool the boost they were looking for in the opening minutes.
But then Vinicius Jr pulled one back while being surrounded by three Liverpool players in the box and then that goal was followed up by a goalkeeping blunder of their own, this time by Alisson, who couldn’t control the ball, hurriedly tried to get rid of it, only for the clearance to bounce of Vinicius Jr into his net. The second half saw Madrid score three more goals to underline their calibre as one of the most lethal teams in the Champions League.
“This Liverpool defence now, who we’ve been told for years have got some of the best players in the world, can’t cope,” said Carragher on CBS Sports. “For years they’ve had a front six in front of them who’ve probably worked harder and smarter than any other team in world football.”
He then referred to a previous interview he did with Virgil Van Dijk two months ago where the Liverpool centre-back had said that Carragher wouldn’t make it into the Klopp team even then.
“What makes me laugh, I’m not that bothered but Virgil van Dijk said I wouldn’t get in that back four about two months ago – I think I’d take his place at the moment! “But we keep talking about midfield players Liverpool need – and that’s right – I think Liverpool need defenders as well,” added Carragher.

"Formula One launch F1 TV in India, target ‘strong mobile market’","Formula One has enjoyed increasing popularity in India, with the country hosting Formula One races at the Buddh International Circuit between 2011-13.","India’s “very strong mobile market” is one of the main factors behind Formula One launching its TV streaming product F1 TV in the country, the sport’s director of media rights Ian Holmes told Reuters.
Formula One has enjoyed increasing popularity in India, with the country hosting Formula One races at the Buddh International Circuit between 2011-13.
In recent years, broadcasters Star Sports aired Formula One in India, while video platform Hotstar streamed the races.
F1 TV, which will be launched in India ahead of the 2023 season, gives fans access to cameras mounted on the cars of 20 drivers as well as the traditional broadcast feed for all race weekends, including practice sessions, qualifying sessions, races and sprint events.
When asked why Formula One had made the decision to launch F1 TV Pro in India, Holmes pointed to the country’s booming online streaming space, saying, “India is a connected market, it’s a sophisticated market, it’s a very strong mobile market.
“In terms of familiarity with digital rights content being through non-traditional channels and platforms, that exists in India, so that was attractive to us,” Holmes added.
“We also obviously talked to Star and one or two other more traditional platforms and we felt that they didn’t value our rights in the way that we did.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We may seek to do a more sort of traditional linear type deal in due course, but we’re very comfortable and confident with F1 TV. There are a lot of very knowledgeable and passionate fans in India.”
Formula One’s global popularity has also seen a significant surge recently, thanks in part to Netflix docu-series ‘Drive to Survive’, with Holmes crediting the splash hit for helping attract younger audiences, as well as more women, to the sport.
“It really has been a lot more popular than I think anyone imagined and seems to go from strength to strength,” Holmes said.
“It’s a double whammy. It’s not just bringing in more fans, it’s also about who those fans are and the value of those fans with regard to the demographic.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Holmes added that Formula One is taking further steps to expand its audience and create a more exciting product.
“Over the last sort of four or five years, we as a business have certainly have grown our resources and our commitment to the sport, in terms of spending money and resources,” Holmes said.
“We have consciously worked hard to push out ever more content on social. I think the on track action has certainly been super exciting. We’ve got some new races, Miami last year and everyone is very excited about Las Vegas this year.

We never exerted any kind of pressure on Sania to win: Father Imran Mirza,"""While Sania was developing as a tennis player, I had the good fortune of working in tandem with some of the world's renowned coaches and that gave me the confidence to coach Sania over the last decade and more,"" Imran Mirza writes.","It is hard to believe but it has been 30 years since Sania picked up a tennis racket for the first time in her life.
Of course, she was gifted with phenomenal talent and it did not take me long to understand this. I have only played club level tennis and some state ranking tournaments in my younger days but have watched and followed the game meticulously and analytically since I was a schoolboy.
I was never a great tennis player but I believe I had a very sharp eye and an analytical brain for the game.
Sania was destined to earn laurels and fame in a sport that she adored. Many famed coaches on the Tour have told me privately that just as God had gifted Sania with abundant talent in tennis, he had also gifted me with the power of observation and understanding of the game to nurture her tennis talent and temperament.
God had also endowed my wife with very special skills that absolutely complemented mine at building a professional career in sport for our daughter.
RIGHT ATTITUDE
The sporting background of my family was what helped us handle losses and wins with the right attitude and this went a long way in building the perfect temperament for Sania as a tennis player.
Tennis is a game that is won or lost in the head and mental strength is of paramount importance. Temperament is the biggest contributor to success and I believe that as parents, our biggest contribution was in playing our part in making Sania fearless on the tennis court.
ADVERTISEMENT
When a child loses on the sports field, he or she is never bothered about what the world thinks of the loss. But what mentally and psychologically affects the child immensely at that tender age is the attitude of the parents while dealing with the loss.
The child’s temperament is shaped by the parents response to his or her failures and losses. I was very conscious of this from the day Sania picked up a tennis racket and we have never ever exerted any kind of pressure whatsoever on her to win.
The focus was always on giving her best and as long as she did that we were happy and literally celebrated on the day she lost to give her a feeling of being supported.
SANIA’S TEMPERAMENT
For years, people have talked about Sania’s unflappable temperament under pressure, her fearlessness and how she has the capacity to come up with brilliance when facing difficult situations during matches.
ADVERTISEMENT
I believe that comes from the confidence which we built in her when she was a child that, as parents, we would always be supportive of her and that winning and losing were all part of the game.
While Sania was developing as a tennis player, I had the good fortune of working in tandem with some of the world’s renowned coaches and that gave me the confidence to coach Sania over the last decade and more.
I have worked alongside Tony Roche (while he was simultaneously coaching Roger Federer), (Late) Bob Brett (who coached Boris Becker and Goran Ivanisevic among others) and Sven Groeneveld (who coached Maria Sharapova).
They all added to Sania’s game and I learnt the finer points and nuances of tennis from these illustrious coaches. I then used that knowledge to adapt those techniques, that I had learnt from them, to suit the Indian body. This is where I believe I was able to get the best out of Sania as a tennis player.
SUCCESS REQUIRES SACRIFICE
ADVERTISEMENT
It takes a lot of sacrifice and effort to produce an international tennis player. Our entire family had a passion for tennis and we were ready to go the extra mile and to do anything it takes to help Sania achieve what no girl from our country had ever achieved in the game.
We were never doing it for the money or for the fame. Whatever effort we put in was purely for the passion that we had for the sport and to give India a world-class women’s tennis player – the kind of which our country had never seen before.
As we look back at the three decades since Sania picked up the racket as a six year old, we have a feeling of great satisfaction and pride at a job well done. We are proud to have given India not only a tennis player, who achieved stupendous success on the international stage for two decades but also a role model, who has given millions of young girls and even boys the belief that nothing is impossible to achieve in any field as long as one has the the dream, the faith and the willingness to work hard with single-minded dedication.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/we-never-exerted-any-kind-of-pressure-on-sania-to-win-father-imran-mirza-8459079/,sports
Leeds name ex-Watford boss Javi Gracia as manager,Leeds are 19th in the standings with 19 points from 23 games and face bottom club Southampton on Saturday.,"Leeds United have agreed terms to appoint former Valencia and Watford head coach Javi Gracia as their new manager on a ‘flexible contract’ to replace Jesse Marsch, the Premier League club said on Tuesday.
American Marsch was sacked on Feb. 6 after a poor run of form left the club in a relegation battle.

— Leeds United (@LUFC) February 21, 2023
“Leeds United are delighted to announce the club have agreed terms with Javi Gracia to become men’s first team head coach, subject to obtaining a work permit,” a club statement read.
Spaniard Gracia, 52, managed Watford for a 20-month spell between January 2018 and September 2019. He led them to an 11th-placed finish and the FA Cup final but was dismissed just four league games into the following season after a poor start.
Gracia has also managed Malaga in Spain’s LaLiga and Rubin Kazan in Russia. His most recent role was with Al Sadd in Qatar, where he won the league before being sacked last June.
Leeds under-21 manager Michael Skubala has been in interim charge since Marsch was sacked after a 1-0 loss at Nottingham Forest left the club one place above the relegation zone.
They have since dropped into the bottom three and are two points from the safety zone, after a draw at Manchester United and then successive defeats by United and Everton.

BCCI ombudsman reduces Chandila’s ban to seven years,Spinner was handed a life-term ban by the board for his alleged involvement in IPL spot-fixing scandal.,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Ombudsman Vineet Saran has reduced former Rajasthan Royals spinner Ajit Chandila ban to seven years.
Chandila was banned for life after his alleged involvement in the spot fixing scandal along with former India pacer S Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan during the 2013 IPL season. It resulted in a big shake up in Indian cricket which made the Supreme Court intervene and change its constitution.
The Indian board had already uplifted Sreesanth’s and Chavan’s ban. Sreesanth went on to play for his side Kerala while Chavan resumed to play for his club team in Mumbai.
In his order Saran wrote, “The present matter arises out of Case Crime No 20/2013 dated 09.05.2013 registered with the Special Cell of Dell Police against the Applicant on allegations of spot fixing in cricket matches of Indian Premier League (“IPL”). Pending inquiry, BCCI suspended the Applicant from all cricketing activities on 17.05.2013. Apart from the criminal proceedings initiated against the Applicant, Disciplinary proceedings were also initiated against him by BCCI. Accordingly, the Applicant’s Representation dated 04.11.2019 is accepted and his prayer for granting him parity with Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan is allowed. The life ban imposed on him by Order of BCCI Disciplinary Committee dated 18.01.2016 is reduced to a period of seven (7) years from 18.01.2016.”
In 2017, the Kerala High Court had lifted the life ban imposed on Sreesanth by the BCCI in the wake of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. In his verdict, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque, said there was no incriminating evidence to pinpoint Sreesanth’s involvement in the spot-fixing scandal. The court pointed out that the committee had come to the conclusion based solely on circumstantial evidence.

The committee found nothing that suggests the cricketer had agreed to spot-fixing. The only probability in such circumstances that could be pointed out against the cricketer was his knowledge on the subject of betting. The evidence pointed out that betting syndicates and other mafia had encircled the gentleman’s game. The court passed the verdict while allowing a writ filed by Sreesanth challenging the BCCI disciplinary committee’s decision.

"Australia aligned with other nations on Russia, Belarus athlete ban","The British government issued the joint statement on Monday on behalf of ""more than 30 like-minded nations"", which held a summit addressed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this month.","The Australian government said on Tuesday it was aligned with 34 other nations on the call for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from its competitions, despite not being marked as a signatory to the statement.
The British government issued the joint statement on Monday on behalf of “more than 30 like-minded nations”, which held a summit addressed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this month.
Australia was a signatory to two statements on the matter which were agreed by “35 like-minded nations” last year but was the only one of those countries not represented in Monday’s new pledge.
A spokesman for the Australian Sports Ministry told Reuters that Australia’s absence was an administrative error and that the government was in accord with the sentiments expressed in the statement.
The statement followed the IOC’s recent proposal to develop a pathway for athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus to compete at next year’s Paris Olympics as neutral athletes despite the ongoing war in Ukraine.
“We have strong concerns on how feasible it is for Russian and Belarusian Olympic athletes to compete as ‘neutrals’ … when they are directly funded and supported by their states,” the statement said.
“The strong links and affiliations between Russian athletes and the Russian military are also of clear concern.

“As long as these fundamental issues and the substantial lack of clarity and concrete detail on a workable ‘neutrality’ model are not addressed, we do not agree that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be allowed back into competition.”
The International Olympic Committee said it would take into consideration the questions raised by those countries in their statement but repeated its position that human rights concerns for Russian and Bealurisian athletes needed to be addressed.
“The International Olympic Committee takes note of the statement by ministerial and senior representatives from ‘a collective group of nations’,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.
“The IOC appreciates the constructive questions with regard to the definition of the neutrality of athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport, while noting that the explicit human rights concerns expressed by two special rapporteurs of the United Nations Human Rights Council have not been addressed in the statement.”

Unacceptable interference
Russian Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin said on Feb. 11 that calls from other countries to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Olympics were an “unacceptable” interference in the activities of independent sports bodies.
Russian track and field athletes have been able to compete at the last two Summer Olympics as Authorised Neutral Athletes after the Russian Athletics Federation was banned by World Athletics for systematic doping in 2015.
Other international sports federations have allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete on a similar basis since last year’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has threatened to boycott the Paris Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes compete.
The IOC is fearful of a return to the days of the Cold War when a series of boycotts of the Olympic Games threatened the existence of the movement.
The two statements by the 35 nations last year called for a ban on all Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competition.
The second also laid out conditions which such athletes should meet if sports federations allowed them to compete, including bans on flags and anthems as well as any public statements of support for the war.

“We also note that Russia and Belarus have it in their own hands to pave the way for their athletes’ full return to the international sports community, namely by ending the war they started,” Monday’s statement concluded.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/australia-aligned-with-other-nations-on-russia-belarus-athlete-ban-8458620/,sports
Spanish court rejects Brazil footballer’s Dani Alves appeal against remand over sex claim,"Alves' lawyer had asked for him to be released on bail if he surrendered his passport and wore an electronic tag, arguing that he had family ties in Spain.","A Spanish court rejected a request by Brazilian soccer player Dani Alves to be released from jail on remand as the investigation over an alleged sexual assault in a Barcelona night club continues, the regional court said on Tuesday.
The 39-year-old, who has denied any wrongdoing, was jailed on remand without bail on Jan. 20 after a local woman filed a complaint last month about an event at the exclusive Sutton nightclub in the city centre. Police are investigating and the case remains open over a crime of sexual assault.
Alves’ lawyer had asked for him to be released on bail if he surrendered his passport and wore an electronic tag, arguing that he had family ties in Spain.
However, the court rejected the arguments and ordered him to remain on remand at the Brians 2 prison on the outskirts of Barcelona.
“There is a high risk of fleeing as… the severe punishment he faces in the present case, the strong evidence of wrongdoing and his economic might would make it possible for him… to leave Spain at any time,” the court said.

The case has attracted significant attention in Spain, because of Alves’ profile but primarily because sexual assault has remained a dominant political theme since the 2016 gang-rape of a teenager during the San Fermin bull-running festival which led to the toughening of sexual violence laws in the country.
In Spain, a claim of rape is investigated under the general accusation of sexual assault and convictions can lead to jail time of between four and 15 years.

"Dinesh Karthik on KL Rahul’s dismal run: ‘It has happened to me when you go into the dressing room, quietly walk into the toilet, and shed a tear or two’","Rahul, whose last 10 Test innings for India have yielded scores of 8, 12, 10, 22, 23, 10, 2, 20, 17, and 1, is set to be replaced by Shubman Gil as the India opener for the Indore Test vs Australia.","India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik has termed KL Rahul being dropped for the third India-Australia Test in Indore starting March 1 an ‘eventuality’ and that he might benefit from it
“He also knows for a fact that if he’s going to be dropped for the next match, which is pretty much an eventuality, it is not because of the one innings, it is because of what has transpired in the last five-six Test matches,” Karthik told Cricbuzz. “He is a class player. He is very good in all formats. At this point, I don’t think it’s the technique, it’s what is happening between the ears. He might need some time away from the game. Come back fresh for the ODIs.”
“This is a professional world, you’ve got to deal with those sorrowful moments but as a player when I look at what he has gone through. When you get out that way knowing very well this could have been your last innings. It has happened to me when you go into the dressing room, quietly walk into the toilet, and shed a tear or two. It’s not a nice feeling because there’s not much you can do,” Karthik further added.
Rahul has been criticised for his form of late as the India opener in the longest form of the game. His last 10 Test innings for India have yielded scores of 8, 12, 10, 22, 23, 10, 2, 20, 17, and 1. Having been replaced by Hardik Pandya as the vice-captain in the ODI format, The Indian Express believes Rahul has also lost his position as Rohit Sharma’s deputy in Test cricket and is set to be replaced by Shubman Gill as India opener in the Indore Test.

He further expanded on why for now India didn’t have to make a tough choice when it came to the player who’d replace Rahul in the XI.
“Temporarily for the moment, I will have to go with Shubman Gill. He batted beautifully. There will be just one change in the India XI (for the third Test). I felt bad for KL Rahul. He has been under the scanner. But One thing is for sure, KL will come back strongly and when he does, there are not too many right-handed batters who can match him with the quality and range of shots.”
Gill has been in incredible form this year across the white ball formats and scored a maiden ODI double hundred apart from two hundreds and a first T20I century.

‘Go and hit a six’- Mohammed Asif reveals what he told ‘Chachu Misbah’ in last over of 2007 T20 WC final,"With four needed off the six balls, Misbah had gone for a scoop shot over short fine-leg, it went straight up in the air, Sreesanth took the catch, and India won the inaugural T20 World Cup.","Former Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif has shared a memory of 2007 T20 World Cup final which they lost to India in the final over and India became the winners of the inaugural season. Talking to YouTuber Reyan Sayed, the 36-year-old pacer said, “My main memory is of the final match when Misbah played that shot. I was there at the non-striker’s end. We had hit a four off the second last ball of the 19th over and Misbah had hit a six off the first ball of the 20th over.
Then I went to him (Misbah) and said Chachu. He’s elder to me so I call him chachu. Don’t take singles and doubles. Go and hit a six as you did on the first ball. The bowler (Joginder Sharma) had lost his rhythm and had no pace. But Misbah played a wrong shot in the wrong direction and we lost the world cup. That will remain the saddest moment for me.”

Djokovic won a record-extending 10th Australian Open title last month to draw level with his great rival Rafa Nadal on 22 Grand Slam victories and leapfrog Carlos Alcaraz into top spot in the ATP rankings.
He already holds the record for the most weeks as the men’s number one after surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021 and began his 377th week at the top on Monday to go level with 22-times major champion Graf.
Russian world number five Andrey Rublev said Djokovic had shown that anything is possible.
“And at the age of 35, he still can be the best player in the world and break records,” Rublev, 25, who lost to Djokovic in the Australian Open quarter-finals, told reporters in Doha.
“If you do the things right, you can perform at the highest level … age doesn’t matter. That’s what it means to me.”
Former world number two Alexander Zverev said Djokovic had shown how consistent he can be by dominating his rivals in the last decade.

‘Joe root battling identity crisis’ reports Telegraph,Joe Root has admitted he is figuring out how he should bat in the Stokes-McCullum set-up.,"‘Joe Root has 10,700 Test runs to his name and 28 hundreds but is having an identity crisis as he struggles to adapt to England’s new way of playing,’ says the start of an interesting article at Telegraph as Nick Hoult analyses the recent travails of Joe Root.
Root has been trying to bat aggressively than ever before – his strike rate has jumped from 52 to 81.2 in the recent times – but the run-flood has ceased. Since last August’s series against South Africa, he has averaged 22 with two fifties in 11 innings. Overall, in McCullum era, he averages over 50 but there were three hundreds in the first four games, which even Root had put down to the feeling of being liberated from the burdens of captaincy. From August on, a staleness has set in or as Telegraph puts it ‘identity crisis’.
Root has admitted he is figuring out how he should bat in the Stokes-McCullum set-up.
“For me I’ve just got to find out what sits best and it’s going to take some time. There was the initial relief of coming out of the captaincy and then now I’m just trying to find out what my role is within this team. It sounds silly having the experience I have but you want to be involved and want to be a part of it, you want to heavily contribute and I felt like I’ve not been able to do that the last few test matches,” he said. “In the recent past it’s a case of…the rhythms of the game, I’ve maybe got a bit caught up in it. But I’m not too far away from what’s given me success.”
England”s captain Ben Stokes, second right, leads his players from the field after defeating New Zealand on the fourth day of their cricket test match in Tauranga, New Zealand. (AP)
He got out playing a reverse-scoop in the first Test against New Zealand and found backing from the coach McCullum to keep playing it.
In a recent Wisden interview, Root had spoken about the shot – he has had success with it in the recent past.
“It was calculated, it was to get them to bowl both sides of the wicket, change their plans and in that middle session, force the game. You take calculated risks. I’ve got where I’ve got to by trusting my gut. It just didn’t quite work out, I just sort of middled the edge of it,” he said. “It’s not going to stop me playing it, maybe just be smarter about playing it, having played it once, maybe look at my movements. It’s now part of my Test game and I’ll continue to utilise it when it’s the right time.”

"‘Bit more method to madness’ Marcus Trescothick, England’s batting coach, talks about Bazball","England were in shambles before McCullum took over as coach last May, losing nine Tests in 2021 - the most of any team in history of Test cricket.","As England registered their 10th win in 11 Tests with a 267-run triumph against New Zealand in the pink ball Test last week, Marcus Trescothick, England’s batting coach, shed some light on the Bazball attacking methods of the coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes.
“There is a bit more method to the madness,” Trescothick told SENZ radio.“It’s not just about you know, ‘Let’s go gung-ho and just be ultra-aggressive.’
“The mantra is (to) try and point pressure on bowlers and try and find opportunities that we can move the game forward.”
Marcus Trescothick. (FILE)
England were in shambles before McCullum took over as coach last May, losing nine Tests in 2021 – the most of any team in history of Test cricket.
“It kind of started with Brendon coming in and sort of looking to evolve the approach of the team,” Trescothick said.
“And then you’ve got the skipper in Ben Stokes also looking to try and do things slightly differently to give the team a different angle and a different way of playing the game.
“I think encouraging them to be more aggressive and to be a bit more free, which then allows us as coaches to then follow through with that ethos and keep pushing the guys towards the danger if you like and keep pushing them to try and find different approaches, find a different way of playing this game.

“We had a period of time beforehand where it didn’t go so well but we needed to move the game forward so it’s kind of breeding itself now. The guys have had success doing it and they’re finding and looking at opportunities where they can go out and be a bit more aggressive and the proof has been in the pudding.

“Despite Australia’s batting issues in this series, there will be a squeeze on if both Warner and Green are fit for the third Test, especially given the last man in, Peter Handscomb, has made himself indispensable as the team’s second-leading run scorer for the series,” Cricket.com.au had added before Warner was adjudged not fit for the third Test at Indore.

Glenn Maxwell, earmarked for this tour before a broken leg cut his hopes, has returned to the field, via Premier Cricket last weekend and a Sheffield Shield game for Victoria. But he is not yet bowling and a Test series in India would mark a major step-up in intensity, the site noted.
“If he gets through everything that he needs to then he’ll be a starter for that one-day series (against India that follows the Tests). Anything forward of that will be discussed,” Andrew McDonald said of Maxwell.

Other options are Cameron Bancroft, the leading Shield run-scorer and considered a good player of spin, Daniel Hughes, who recently made 178 and 63 no on a slow SCG pitch, and Marcus Harris, who was a back-up during the last home summer, as per cricket.com.au.
Cameron Green back
Cameron Green whose fitness Australia were sweating on, is expected to be back for the third Test starting March 1.
“(Green) had a little setback batting in Bangalore (on a pre-tour camp) where he had some jarring and there was a fair bit of discomfort in that finger,” McDonald was quoted.

England’s absence robs WTC final of ‘Bazball’ buzz,"Two years after losing to New Zealand in the inaugural WTC final in Southampton, India are on the verge of sealing a spot in June's title decider at The Oval.","This year’s World Test Championship (WTC) final will again be a party without hosts, leaving England fans wishing their team’s ‘Bazball’ revolution had been sparked a little earlier.
Two years after losing to New Zealand in the inaugural WTC final in Southampton, India are on the verge of sealing a spot in June’s title decider at The Oval.
India, who have taken an emphatic 2-0 lead in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia, need one more victory to secure their place, while avoiding a 4-0 whitewash would punch a ticket for Pat Cummins and his men.
Our first Test win in New Zealand in 1️⃣5️⃣ years! 🦁

Should either of them fail in their pursuits, only Sri Lanka have an outside chance of gatecrashing the party, but they must triumph 2-0 in New Zealand in March before even dreaming of making the final.
England’s mathematical chance of making the final were snuffed out after India hammered Australia inside three days in Nagpur earlier this month.
It came just as England, under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon “Baz” McCullum, were threatening to change the way test cricket is played with the “Bazball” approach to the longest format.
The stunning transformation continued with a comprehensive victory over New Zealand at Tauranga on Sunday, which gave the new captain-coach partnership a 10th win in 11 tests since they came in and put the emphasis on entertainment over outcome.
“It’s completely unrecognisable,” veteran seamer Stuart Broad said at Bay Oval on the eve of the victory on Saturday.

“It’s a bit of a shame there’s not a fly-on-the-wall documentary on it because it’s amazing to be part of. I’m so lucky to see it first-hand.
“Honestly, since June, I can’t remember a negative word in the dressing room. It’s phenomenal to watch how Baz and Stokesy go about their business.”
Stokes replaced Joe Root as captain in April last year after debacles in Australia and West Indies, which effectively cooked England’s WTC goose and prompted the change in the guard.
Top nine test teams play six series each – three at home and three away – in a two-year cycle, with the top two making the final of the WTC, which was designed to lend context to bilateral series.

Under Stokes, England blanked New Zealand 3-0, beat India at Edgbaston and prevailed 2-1 against South Africa on home soil.

Hayden, who worked with Pakistan during their run to the T20 World Cup final, could be of assistance for the current Aussie side according to Clarke, wrote Fox news.
India retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy inside sox days with dominant wins at Nagpur and Delhi, leaving Australia needing a draw or win in the remaining two Tests to make the World Test Championship final.

Clarke joined calls for Matthew Hayden, who has 30 Test centuries including two in India, to be brought into the Aussie support staff. “Look at the staff. Are we getting enough help here? Do we need some more advice, guidance?” he told Sky Sports Radio’s Big Sports Breakfast show.
“Something so simple. You’ve got Matthew Hayden in India at the moment commentating and Mark Waugh as well. They’re at the ground. So it’d be a no-brainer to go to someone like Matthew Hayden, who is a massive sweeper. He’s probably the only Australian batsman that has had success sweeping in India.
It was Haydos’ commentary stint refrain that left Clarke urging for him to be brought into the fold. “Matty Hayden said it a hundred times on commentary yesterday, ‘Boys, I wouldn’t be sweeping here, don’t sweep, don’t sweep, don’t sweep’. These batters, go and talk to Haydos, who’s a sweeping genius, because he’s telling you not to sweep.
“I feel we’re a little bit nervous to get outside help because it might be a little critical.

“I think if you just stay in your bubble in situations like this, that’s where it gets harder because you keep making the same mistakes and the fans get crazier. Do some things to try and get better, that’s what we need to try to do,” he added.

Hayden was critical of the Aussies’ over-use of sweep shots during their third innings capitulation, explaining on the Cricket Et Cetera podcast: “The ball not going over the stumps means you can only sweep on line.
“You’ve got to see what the Indian batsmen do and that’s come down to the ball. Once you start moving your feet, then they might start tossing it wide, then the sweep shot might be an option.

One of the toughest innings I have played: Smriti Mandhana,"Thanks to Mandhana's career-best knock, India posted 155 for six after opting to bat first in their last group match of the Women's T20 World Cup.","Star opener Smriti Mandhana on Monday described the match-winning 87-run knock against Ireland as one of her toughest innings due to the difficult conditions at St George’s Park.
Thanks to Mandhana’s career-best knock, India posted 155 for six after opting to bat first in their last group match of the Women’s T20 World Cup. In their run chase, Ireland were 54 for two in 8.2 overs, when heavy rains stopped play. The DLS par score after 8.2 overs was 59, and Ireland were five runs short of that total.
As the match could not be restarted, India won the match under the D/L method.
“The finger is fine. One of the most toughest innings I would have played. Not the wicket but the pace they were bowling and with the wind, it got worse,” Mandhana said after the match.
“We were telling each other (with opening partner Shafali Verma) to try and maintain our shape. I was batting bad and she was not timing it well,” said Mandhana, who was named the player of the match for her 56-ball knock.
“But we were trying to discuss that and there was a lot of wind and we needed to get used to the pace they were bowling. Good to post some runs and go into the semis. The England match wasn’t the way we wanted.” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said it was a good game for her side.
“Smriti got runs, which is very important for us. Whenever she gives us starts we get to good total.” Asked why she batted at number three, Harmanpreet, who made 13, said, “Just wanted to go up and spend some time in the middle, since I haven’t really got that.

Paris Olympics 2024: 30 nations write to IOC asking it to clarify definition of ‘neutrality’,"Among those signing the letter were officials from USA, Britain, France, Canada and Germany. Those five countries brought nearly one-fifth of all athletes to the Tokyo Olympics.","The governments of more than 30 nations released a letter on Monday calling on the IOC to clarify the definition of “neutrality” as it seeks a way to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes back into international sports and, ultimately, next year’s Paris Olympics.
“As long as these fundamental issues and the substantial lack of clarity and concrete detail on a workable ‘neutrality’ model are not addressed, we do not agree that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be allowed back into competition,” read the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press in advance of its wider release.
Among those signing the letter were officials from the United States, Britain, France, Canada and Germany. Those five countries brought nearly one-fifth of all athletes to the Tokyo Games in 2021. Other countries — such as Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, which had suggested an Olympic boycott was possible if the war continues — also signed onto the letter, which did not go so far as to mention a boycott.
The letter was the product of a Feb. 10 summit in London between government leaders, who heard from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said Russia athletes had no place at the Paris Games as long as the country’s invasion of Ukraine continues.
The International Olympic Committee is trying to find a way to allow Russians into the Olympics, citing the opinion of United Nations human rights experts who believe Russians and Belarusians should not face discrimination simply for the passports they hold. The IOC wants competitors from those countries who have not supported the war to be able to compete as neutral athletes, with no symbols of their countries allowed.
Assistant Secretary of State Lee Satterfield signed the letter on behalf of the United States. In a separate statement, she emphasised the need for the IOC to provide clarity on the definition of neutrality.
“The United States will continue to join a vast community of nations to hold Russia and Belarus — and the bad actors who dictate their actions — accountable for this brutal war,” Satterfield said. “Russia has proven, time and again, it has no regard for and is incapable of following the rules — in international sport and in international law.”
ADVERTISEMENT
While acknowledging there was an argument for them to compete as neutral athletes, the government officials noted in the joint letter how closely sports and politics are intertwined in Russia and Belarus. Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago on Friday and Belarus has been Russia’s closest ally.
“We have strong concerns on how feasible it is for Russian and Belarusian Olympic athletes to compete as ‘neutrals’ — under the IOC’s conditions of no identification with their country — when they are directly funded and supported by their states (unlike, for example, professional tennis players),” the letter said. “The strong links and affiliations between Russian athletes and the Russian military are also of clear concern. Our collective approach throughout has therefore never been one of discrimination simply on the basis of nationality, but these strong concerns need to be dealt with by the IOC.”
When the war started, the IOC recommended sports organisations bar Russians from competitions, labelling it as a measure for those athletes’ safety. That stance changed at the start of this year. Last week, IOC president Thomas Bach said the IOC stood in solidarity with Ukraine’s athletes, but also that sports has to respect the human rights of all athletes.
“History will show who is doing more for peace. The ones who try to keep lines open, to communicate, or the ones who want to isolate or divide,” Bach said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Also last week, European Union lawmakers condemned the IOC’s efforts to reintegrate Russia into world sports. The EU parliament asked the 27 member states to pressure the IOC to reverse its decision and said the Olympic body’s approach was “an embarrassment to the international world of sport.”
Monday’s letter, while calling for clarity from the IOC, said the quickest way for Russia to get back into the international sports scene would be “by ending the war they started.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/paris-olympics-2024-30-nations-write-to-ioc-asking-it-to-clarify-definition-of-neutrality/,sports
"‘I didn’t watch Champions League final again until last weekend, it was torture’: Juergen Klopp","The Reds won their first three matches against Real in European competition, between 1981 and 2009. Since then, however, they are winless in six games against them, with five of those ending in defeat.","Liverpool coach Juergen Klopp conceded that he had not been able to bring himself to rewatch last season’s Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid until this past weekend, insisting reliving the experience was “torture”.
The Reds won their first three matches against Real in European competition, between 1981 and 2009. Since then, however, they are winless in six games against them, with five of those ending in defeat.
Two of those losses came in the 2018 and 2022 finals, the latter being particularly painful for Klopp ahead of the visit of Real to Anfield for the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.
“Different things happened to us with Real Madrid,” Klopp told a news conference on Monday. “One of the biggest clubs in the world, super experienced.
“Our own story, we played this final in Paris (last year). I didn’t watch it back until this weekend and I know why I didn’t watch it back now, it was proper torture.
“We played a good game and could’ve won the game. They scored a decisive goal and we didn’t. You could see how experienced Madrid is.”
Liverpool are enduring a disappointing season domestically, sitting eighth in the Premier League standings, 19 points behind leaders Arsenal.

Klopp does not believe that means Liverpool should go into Tuesday’s clash against the record 14-time European champions with any trepidation.
“I’m really happy we can play this game now rather than a few weeks ago,” Klopp added. “We need to play a super game. Two super games to be honest to get through. I have no problem with that.
“We always work so hard for qualifying for the Champions League that I really think you have to cherish these moments. It will be a special game.
“I expect Anfield on their toes. They saw us in better shape last two games, more things to look forward to. It’s Real Madrid. We can’t play this game without respect. They are absolutely world class. It’s a well set-up team and that’s why it’s so difficult. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.”

In the last 24 hours, the national boxing federations of the Netherlands and Switzerland had announced they were joining the list of nations to not send their boxers to the World Championships, which will be held from March 15 to 26 at New Delhi’s IG Sports Complex.
USA, Ireland, Great Britain, Canada, Sweden and Czech Republic had also threatened to boycott the event over the inclusion of Russian and Belarussian boxers, who have been allowed to compete under their flag and national anthems.
The move by the beleaguered IBA to announce its own Olympic Qualification System (OQS) for Paris 2024 was dismissed by the IOC. It had barred the IBA from organising the boxing event at the upcoming Olympics in Paris. The IOC had unequivocally said that it would be taking over the management of organising a qualification pathway for Paris 2024 as well. In fact, in September last year the IOC’s EB had approved its Paris 2024 qualification pathway, which would see continental events like the Asian Games being designated as quota events. After the five continental events were done, the IOC was to organise two more global events to offer quotas to boxers for Paris.
IOC reiterates that IBA is suspended
Late on Monday, an IOC spokesperson told The Indian Express, “As announced by the IOC in June 2022, the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament. The only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022. Following an investigation and report by an IOC Inquiry Committee in 2019, recognition of the International Boxing Association was suspended by the IOC. This suspension is still in force today.”
Despite the IOC’s clarification, the presence of two so-called qualification pathways is likely to further split an already divided boxing world with one block of nations rallying around USA, Ireland and Great Britain while the other rallying around the IBA.
The IBA said that “no other qualification process for Paris 2024 will be accepted by the IBA and the boxing community”. As per the IBA’s qualification system, the Women’s World Boxing Championships, Men’s World Boxing Championships, and an open event in May 2024 will be the tournaments offering direct quotas to the Paris Olympics.

The IBA will also use world and continental ranking quotas besides handing out host country and universality spots.
“With less than 18 months to Paris 2024 and numerous delays on a clear International Olympic Committee (IOC) process being announced for Paris 2024 qualification, the IBA has taken upon itself, as the international governing body of boxing, to provide a clear process and pathway for its athletes to qualify for Paris 2024. The IBA OQS decision was unanimously taken by National Federations at the IBA Ordinary Congress in Abu Dhabi,” boxing’s global governing body said in a statement on Monday.
“This is a necessary step to protect our athletes as the IOC proposed qualification process consisting of one competition is not acceptable and fair for the athletes. To exclude World Champions from the upcoming Women’s and Men’s World Boxing Championships in New Delhi and Tashkent from qualifying for Paris 2024 is not acceptable and against the principles of sport and boxing,” it added.
As for the eight national boxing federations to have announced boycotts of the Worlds in New Delhi, the IBA said it would allow boxers to “directly register” for the World Boxing Championships by sending an email to them and also promised to provide the boxers with financial aid through its Financial Support Program (FSP).
After widespread corruption among judges and referees at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics boxing event, IOC had snatched away the right to host the boxing event at the deferred Tokyo Olympics from IBA (then known as AIBA).

Over the last few months, the IOC has also threatened to drop the sport completely from the Paris 2024 program if the IBA does not clean up its house. The sport did not make it to the initial sports program for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, although it can be added later.
Beside corruption at the Rio Olympics, IOC has also been concerned by governance and fairness issues within the IBA. The fact that IBA gets most of its sponsorships funds through the Russian oil company Gazprom is an issue constantly raised by the critics of IBA president Umar Kremlev, who is also Russian.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/faced-with-boycotts-and-ioc-pressure-iba-says-delhi-world-boxing-championships-will-be-paris-2024-qualifier/,sports

Champions League greats Liverpool and Real Madrid collide,"If any team can rival Madrid's ability to produce the unexpected in European club soccer's most prized competition, it is Liverpool.","With 20 Champions League titles between them, Liverpool vs. Real Madrid is a meeting of two European soccer greats.
Their round-of-16 match at Anfield on Tuesday is also a repeat of last year’s final in Paris, which saw Madrid win the competition for a record-extending 14th time after producing a series of improbable comebacks just to make it to the European showpiece at the Stade de France.
“I still shake my head and scratch my head,” said former England coach and BT Sport analyst Glenn Hoddle.
“I covered every one of those games and I still don’t know how they won it. They were out.” Madrid secured come-from-behind wins against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in each of the knockout rounds before beating Liverpool 1-0 in the final.
“They were like a boxer, they were up against the ropes and they were halfway down the ropes and you’re thinking the ref’s going to step in and stop the bout,” Hoddle said.
“I don’t know what happened, they just kept going. And they had that quality.” Where the Champions League is concerned anything seems possible for Madrid, which won the trophy three years in a row from 2016-18 at a time when Barcelona was dominating the Spanish title.
But if any team can rival Madrid’s ability to produce the unexpected in European club soccer’s most prized competition, it is Liverpool.

There was the famous comeback from 3-0 down against AC Milan in the 2005 final before going on to win on penalties. And more recently the 4-3 aggregate win against Barcelona in the semifinals in 2019 after losing 3-0 in the first leg at the Nou Camp.
Madrid, however, has felt like a step too far ever since the draw was made last November.
After all, this is a Liverpool team that faces a fight just to qualify for next season’s competition, let alone win it this year.
Jurgen Klopp has struggled to get his team firing after the departure of key forward Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich last summer and a host of injuries.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ahead of the first-leg match at Anfield, Klopp can at least be encouraged by a recent upturn in form after back-to-back wins against Everton and Newcastle in the Premier League and goals from misfiring forwards Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez.
Suddenly Liverpool looks in contention again for a Champions League-qualifying spot, sitting seven points off fourth place Tottenham with two games in hand.
Then there is the Anfield factor, with an atmosphere that saw Barcelona wilt in that semifinals comeback and Manchester City repeatedly fall despite dominating English soccer in recent years.

Joe Cole played for and against Liverpool and was part of a Chelsea team that lost in the semifinals at Anfield in 2005 and 2007.
“It’s a huge club. It’s as big a club in world football as any and it’s got an expectancy and the fans drive it,” said the BT Sport analyst.
“In the ground they turn up for their team. It’s a sight to behold to play for or against them.” But Cole questions whether Liverpool can overcome this Madrid team, which recently won the Club World Cup.
“They’ve got a job on their hands,” Cole said. “This Real Madrid team is actually better than the team that won it last year, I believe. They’ve improved. The young players coming through are going to be better and the older players are still doing it.” Madrid also beat Liverpool in the final of 2018 and won when the sides met in the quarterfinals two years ago.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/champions-league-greats-liverpool-and-real-madrid-collide-8456577/,sports

Back to the drawing board for panicky Australia after another India failure,"The honeymoon for Pat Cummins's captaincy is well and truly over after the six-wicket capitulation in New Delhi, and few of his team mates have been spared the wrath of furious former players and pundits.","A confident Australia landed in India with genuine hope of winning their first test series in the south Asian nation in nearly 20 years but they head to the third match in Indore with a 2-0 deficit and a chorus of criticism ringing in their ears.
The honeymoon for Pat Cummins’s captaincy is well and truly over after the six-wicket capitulation in New Delhi, and few of his team mates have been spared the wrath of furious former players and pundits.
“I’m disappointed, I’m shell-shocked – angry about the way we went about our work,” former Australia captain Allan Border said on broadcaster Fox Cricket after Cummins’s team lost nine wickets in a session to hasten defeat on Sunday.
“It was panicky, frenetic batting.”
After a dominant home summer, Australia had ambitions of emulating the great 2004 team that beat India 2-1 away to cement their status as global champions.

The tour has instead been little short of a disaster, with untimely injuries, bewildering selections and familiar batting failures against quality spin bowling – all after opting against playing a single tour match.
“Major, major, major mistake,” former Australia captain Michael Clarke told Australian radio.
“There should have been at least one game over there to get used to the conditions.”
ADVERTISEMENT
After Australia were skittled for 91 in the series-opener in Nagpur, Cummins called on his batters to be more proactive against the wiles of India’s peerless spin trio of Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.
They duly over-corrected in a bizarre morning session on Sunday when six batsmen fell to sweep-shots, including Steve Smith who rarely plays the stroke.
They have other concerns on the road to Indore.
Injury has ruled paceman Josh Hazlewood out of the series, while Cummins flew home on Monday due to a serious family illness.
Fitness queries remain over opening batsman David Warner, all-rounder Cameron Green and paceman Mitchell Starc.

For all that, should Australia find a comfortable medium between the extremes of timidity and manic attack in their batting, they may be able to salvage something from the last two tests.
Their spinners have proved a handful for Rohit Sharma’s side, with Nathan Lyon leading the way with seven wickets in New Delhi following Todd Murphy’s excellent seven-wicket debut in Nagpur.

IND vs AUS : Ian Chappell calls Australian selections as ‘Panic selections’ and overthinking selections,The Australian great was critical of the Australian selectors of the team combinations for the first two Test matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy,"Terming Australia’s selections in the first two Test matches of the Border-Gavaskar trophy as ‘Panic selections’, former Australian captain Ian Chappell has slammed Australia’s Test selectors on ‘overthinking’ the line-up. With the Australian team management not picking up Travis Head for the first Test at Nagpur, Chappell was more critical of the bowling selections for the Delhi Test. The Australian team management had overlooked left-arm spinner Ashton Agar and had called another left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann ahead of the second Test at Delhi. The Pat Cummins-led Australian team lost the second Test by six wickets and is now trailing 0-2 in the four-Test match series.
“I don’t think there was any justification for some of the things they have done-their selections smacked of panic. If you want to look at panic, the dropping of Head (and) playing Renshaw saying he’s a good player of spin bowling, and you bat him in the middle order. You come in the second Test with one quick only, you fly Kuhnemann over from Australia and you play him ahead of Agar, who bowls the same sort of stuff, and was in the original squad. Now you are going to tell me they are not panic selections? This is the problem… they overthink things,” said Chappell while speaking with Wide World of Sports.
With Australia suffering an innings and 132-run loss in Nagpur followed by a six-wicket loss in Delhi in the second Test of the series, the Pat Cummins team had been left looking for answers for the dismal performances. With only two Australian batsmen able to cross double figures in the second innings at Delhi, Chappell also blamed the team management for the batting selections as well picking up the right bowling options. With all-rounder Cameron Green still not fit for the series, the former Australian captain opined the team management don’t have any clue for the right bowling combination in India.

“I don’t think they know what their best bowling lineup is. I also don’t think they think what their best batting lineup is in India, but … the best batsmen are in India now. You’ve got to pick your best bowlers. As the selector, you have to ask who do you think will take the 20 wickets the quickest. And I don’t think they’ve got a clue who that is, certainly not in India. In Australia, they know damn well-three quickies, Green as a fourth seamer, and one spinner, they’re fine here. But this is not Australia-It’s in India and you’ve got to find a way to play well, and Australia haven’t found that method,” said Chappell.
While debutant Khunemann finished with match figures of 2 for 110 in Delhi, Chappell wasn’t impressed with the Australian spinner and supported Agar, who was picked in the original squad. “Agar must be bowling very badly if they pick him in the original squad, and they put this guy ahead of him. What the hell’s Agar doing? There wasn’t a lot to be impressed with Kuhnemann.

‘Ronaldo was upset about being benched but he was always with the team’: Portugal teammate Caravalho reveals world-cup drama,But Caravalho says that Ronaldo didn’t take the dire step of threatening to leave the squad.,"Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal teammate William Caravalho has opened the lid on the controversial scenes during the World Cup at Qatar. Portugal had left out captain Cristiano Ronaldo out of their starting line-up, keeping hat-trick hero Goncalo Ramos in the team for the quarter-final against Morocco. And Portugal’s football federation then had to deny reports that their skipper had threatened to leave the tournament after the manager Fernando Santos benched him.
“It was a complicated situation. He was already having problems with Manchester United. He started playing in the national team, but then there was a game in which the manager didn’t put him on and it’s normal for Cristiano to have been upset. Any player would be; no one likes to sit on the bench”, Caravalho told the newspaper A Bola.
But Caravalho says that Ronaldo didn’t take the dire step of threatening to leave the squad.
“Cristiano Ronaldo was upset at having gone to the bench, but he was always with the team. Even though he wasn’t playing, he always helped us. The team knew how to separate the problems that Cristiano had and that didn’t affect anyone”, Caravalho said.

Caravalho also had words of praise for the beleaguered world cup coach of Portugal Fernando Santos.
“The truth is that when the results are not in line with what people want, nor with the potential of the national team, criticism comes naturally. It is normal for many people to ask for the dismissal of the manager, but I think he did a job extraordinary in the national team.

“Although Rooty [Joe Root] has stuck like a little badge on Baz’s bag saying ‘Bazball’ on it. Not sure if he’s picked that up yet, but he’ll hate that.”
“He [McCullum] loves everyone else taking plaudits rather than himself – he was like that as a player and pretty sure he was like that as a captain, and we’ve seen that’s what he’s like as a coach.“Bazball doesn’t really have a good ring to it, does it?”.

Spurs up to fourth with 2-0 home victory over West Ham,There was little to separate the sides in a forgettable first half but the hosts stepped up the pace after the interval with goals by Emerson Royal and substitute Son Heung-min.,"Tottenham Hotspur moved into the Premier League’s top four as they returned to form with a 2-0 home win over West Ham United that left their London rivals in the bottom three on Sunday.
There was little to separate the sides in a forgettable first half but the hosts stepped up the pace after the interval with goals by Emerson Royal and substitute Son Heung-min.
It was an important win for Spurs after defeat at Leicester City and a midweek loss away to AC Milan in the Champions League as they leapfrogged Newcastle United in the table.
Right back Emerson marked his 50th Premier League game by opening the scoring in the 56th minute.
Son, who has struggled for form this season and was left out of the starting lineup by stand-in manager Cristian Stellini, then linked with Harry Kane four minutes after coming on to double the Tottenham’s advantage in the 72nd.
Relegation-threatened West Ham had started the derby brightly with Jarrod Bowen wasting an early chance but offered little and have now won only once in their last 11 league games with pressure mounting on manager David Moyes.
Spurs have 42 points from 24 games, one more than Newcastle who have a game in hand. West Ham are in 18th with 20 points from 23 matches, a point below the safety zone.
SON BENCHED

With Tottenham head coach Antonio Conte again absent as he recovers from gallbladder surgery, his assistant Stellini shook up the starting lineup with Son and Ivan Perisic benched.
Initially his side laboured and there was little for the home fans to get excited about in the opening 45 minutes, although Spurs did have a penalty appeal turned down when Richarlison’s pass was handled by Thilo Kehrer.
Had Bowen scored early on when well positioned instead of shooting wide, West Ham might have capitalised on a Tottenham team who have struggled desperately for consistency.
Spurs were far better in the second half but Kane and Richarlison wasted chances before a flowing move gave the hosts the lead.

Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s superb pass released Ben Davies down the left and his pass was perfectly weighted for Emerson Royal to coolly slot a shot past goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.
The second goal was from a much more familiar link-up as Kane’s pass released Son and the South Korean fired a right-foot shot into the net.
It was only Son’s fifth league goal of the season, with three of his other efforts coming in a hat-trick off the bench in a home win against Leicester City.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/spurs-up-to-fourth-with-2-0-home-victory-over-west-ham-8455161/,sports

Women’s T20 World Cup: West Indies squeeze past Pakistan in thriller,"Bidding to build on their win over Ireland, the Windies opted to bat and posted a below-par 116-6 at Boland Park.","West Indies kept their slender semifinal hopes alive with a nail-biting three-run win over Pakistan in a last-ball finish in the Women’s T20 World Cup here on Sunday.
West Indies (-0.601), who have played all their group matches and are on four points, can still qualify for the semifinals if India (+0.205), also on four points, lose to Ireland by a huge margin, denting their net run rate and Pakistan, who are on two points also go down to England.
Bidding to build on their win over Ireland, the Windies opted to bat and posted a below-par 116-6 at Boland Park.
Skipper Hayley Matthews took key Pakistan wickets early and late in the innings to inspire her side to a dramatic victory.
Matthews and Rashada Williams flayed 15 from the bowling of Aiman Anwer in the fourth over but navigated the powerplay in cagey fashion.
Matthews perished late in the powerplay when she tried to lift Fatima Sana over the midwicket boundary but only found the hands of Sidra Ameen.
It was a massive wicket that sparked wild celebrations but Shemaine Campbelle joined Williams and the pair put on 40 at a run-a-ball.

The second-wicket stand came to a tame end when Williams offered a simple return catch to the outstanding Sadia Iqbal to depart for 30.
Chinelle Henry muscled two boundaries but was trapped in front by Nida Dar for 11 and Campbelle went in the next over, smartly stumped by Muneeba Ali.
Dar bowled Aaliyah Alleyne in the penultimate over, her 125th T20I wicket, making her the joint-leading wicket-taker in the history of the format.
Pakistan began cautiously in reply to 116-6 and it was Windies game-changer Matthews who got the breakthrough, dismissing the dangerous Muneeba Ali for five in the fourth over.
ADVERTISEMENT
Matthews was at the heart of the action again two balls later when she took a sharp catch at midwicket to account for Sidra Ameen, with Pakistan at 15 for two.
The experienced pairing of Bismah and Dar then embarked on a measured partnership that rarely got out of first gear until the latter whipped Henry to the midwicket fence in the 13th over.
Dar looked to go aerial again in the next over but was deceived in the flight by Afy Fletcher and caught at extra cover by Karishma Ramharack, with 57 runs still required.
Pakistan have been by some distance the best finishers at this tournament and Aliya Riaz began to free her arms.

But she lost the stabilising influence of Bismah who was given out LBW on review after mistiming a reverse sweep off the bowling of Matthews.

“Yeah, I knew I needed to make a few birdies. I knew where I stood after 9 when I saw the leader boards. I didn’t do much until 14.
“Yesterday I birdied three of the last four, so I tried to think that it’s possible today, too, and I ended up birdieing two of the last four, which was good.” Aditi, looking for a fast start just did not get it as she had five pars and a bogey in the first six holes. She then found three birdies in a row from seventh to ninth to turn in 2-under.

Neymar picked up the injury at the start of the second half after the Brazil forward scored PSG’s second goal before the interval.
PSG led 2-1 when Neymar was injured following contact with Lille’s Benjamin Andre.
PSG has been struggling since the start of the year, with stars Neymar and Lionel Messi underperforming. Neymar has been on the end of sharp criticism for a perceived lack of commitment after French media reported that he attended a poker tournament and dined at a fast-food restaurant a day after PSG lost to Bayern Munich 1-0 at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League round of 16.
Neymar, who damaged the same ankle at the World Cup in Qatar, gave PSG a 2-0 lead at the end of a fast-developing collective move he also started, slotting the ball into an empty net from Vitinha’s assist.
It’s unclear whether Neymar will be able to play next Sunday against second-placed Marseille in French soccer’s biggest match.
PSG lost another key player against Lille, with Nuno Mendes going off near the half-hour mark. Mendes, who played on the left side of PSG’s backline against Lille, was substituted after colliding with winger Jonathan Bamba.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/neymar-leaves-pitch-injured-in-psgs-match-against-lille-8455091/,sports
Red-hot Marcus Rashford nets double as Manchester United see off Leicester,"United moved on to 49 points, three behind second-placed Manchester City after 24 games and five adrift of leaders Arsenal, who have played a game less.","Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford’s superb run of form continued as he netted a goal in each half of his side’s 3-0 Premier League win over Leicester City on Sunday to extend his scoring streak to five games.
Leicester were left to rue wasteful early finishing when Rashford latched onto a pass down the right from Bruno Fernandes and rifled the ball across keeper Danny Ward and into the net after 25 minutes at Old Trafford.
England international Rashford bagged his second in the 56th minute, cutting in from the left and tearing into the box before guiding the ball home to register his 14th league goal of the season and his 25th in all competitions.

Substitute Jadon Sancho added a brilliant third five minutes later when Lisandro Martinez won the ball in midfield to allow Rashford to feed Sancho, who played a quick exchange of passes with Fernandes before drilling home.
Leicester rang the changes in an effort to get back into the game but United continued to have the better chances, with Sancho and Wout Weghorst spurning good opportunities to add a fourth.

KL Rahul is no longer Test vice-captain; Rohit Sharma to decide who will be his deputy,Selectors didn't name a vice-captain when the team was announced for the 3rd and 4th Test matches against Australia.,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has left it to India captain Rohit Sharma to decide the vice-captain for two remaining Test matches against Australia in Indore and Ahmedabad. This means KL Rahul is no longer Rohit’s deputy.
When the squad for the first two Test matches was announced in December, Rahul was named the vice-captain. However, it is learnt that the selectors have decided to unburden the out-of-form opener.
“It was decided not to name any vice-captain. Instead the power was given to Rohit Sharma. Who will lead the side in case he has to leave the field is Rohit Sharma’s call,” a source told The Indian Express.
The senior selection committee members flew from Kolkata, where they were watching the Ranji Trophy final, to Delhi to pick the team for the third and fourth Test matches. After Chetan Sharma, the chairman of selectors resigned post the sting operation, the meeting was chaired by former India opener SS Das.

Vinícius again the target of insults in Spanish league match,"“The insults continue, but so does the dancing,” Vinícius said on Twitter after the victory.","The insults against Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior have continued in Spain, with the Brazil forward again being targeted by opposing fans in a Spanish league match.
The insults started during the moment of silence before Madrid’s 2-0 win at Osasuna on Saturday, and continued with fans chanting, “Die, Vinícius” later in the game.
“The insults continue, but so does the dancing,” Vinícius said on Twitter after the victory.
Returning from a one-game suspension, Vinícius led Madrid’s attack and set up the late goal by Federico Valverde that put Madrid on its way to a win on the road.
The 22-year-old Vinícius, who is Black, has been the target of hate insults since arriving to play in Spain in 2018. Several racist attacks have been made against him during matches, and his effigy was hanged by the neck off a bridge before a derby against city rival Atletico Madrid last month.

“It’s lamentable,” Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said. “There’s no place for this nonsense. We have to stop looking at Vinícius, we have to start looking at the fans. It’s a shame, because you see kids with their parents and they are showing him the finger.” Madrid’s veteran Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti said the foul language directed at Vinícius during the moment of silence in honor of earthquake victims was “a disrespect toward Tukey and Syria.” A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit those countries on Feb. 6, killing more than 44,000 people.

"‘Paanch baar stump ki aawaz aayi hai jor jor se’, Ravindra Jadeja elaborates his bowling vs Australia to Axar Patel",The player of the match in Delhi Test took a liking for the sound of the ball crashing the stumps for five of his seven dismissals in the second innings.,"For Ravindra Jadeja, bowling on day three of the second India-Australia Test was as simple as it gets.
“When you get wickets like this in India, it’s obviously good. The role and responsibility of a spinner get elevated. I try to bowl in the stump line since most of their (Australia) batters try to play sweep and reverse sweep shots. If they miss, the ball that stays low will hit the stumps. Luckily, that’s what happened today.

Team spirit and strength in doubles brings medal in Asian Mixed Team Badminton,"Rooting for each other, even after personal defeats, and ability to bounce back from deficits augurs well for Sudirman Cup.","Chirag Shetty remembers his first Thomas Cup in 2016, and the disparate constituents of that team who were just indifferent to what was happening in each other’s matches. “One was having lunch, one was watching someone else’s match, some were sitting in the dugout but not cheering. All that has changed now,” Shetty says after India won its first bronze medal at the Asian Mixed Team Championships after narrowly losing out to China in the semifinals.
A team huddle before they set off to Dubai, only for players without coaches, is now a Step 1 in the team building exercise. This time Shetty would tell the youngsters, the one medal missing for India was in mixed team events. “We took it as a challenge that we can win that medal,” Treesa Jolly would say.
The trend of a united dugout, all marching to the same tune and cheering during each other’s matches, has been like a wave from Aarhus Thomas Cup 2020 to the championship win at Bangkok 2022, to the Birmingham Commonwealth Games to now in Dubai. “The team truly came together in the previous Thomas Cup where we lost in the quarters actually. But we realised that camaraderie is built if you stick together, especially when you lose. In the team meetings in the past few days, we have been repeating ‘You can pass through the most difficult situations if you are facing them as a team,’” says Shetty. “The team spirit culminates into medals. India will be a very strong team at the Sudirman Cup.”
IT’S A BRONZE 🥉🥳
An extraordinary feat achieved by #TeamIndia as they win their 1️⃣st ever medal in the history of the competition. 🔥

“How’s the josh (passion)?” riffed off a movie, has been their cheer verse for a while now. But the real teamwork kicks in typically when they are 0-2 down as they had been against Hong Kong in the quarters and then against China.
“We expected (HS) Prannoy and (PV) Sindhu to win, but went down 0-2. Many wrote us off. But we got back to make it 3-2. Their support from the dugout at that point mattered a lot,” Shetty said, adding that not sulking on personal losses and just turning up to blow trumpets and rattlers from the sidelines, counts for much for those on court. India’s doubles pairings would feed off that aural energy and stun Chinese combinations from a game down.
Shetty stresses that the first spark of inspiration came from the youngest members. “When Treesa-Gayatri and Ishaan-Tanisha beat the Malaysian pairings, even we were motivated to bring that one point for the team,” he said. Shetty and Dhruv Kapila had lost to the world champions that day – the only loss in a 1-4 winning tie to top the group. But the whole group would shrug off losses, and revel in others’ wins.
Treesa, an energiser bunny of hyperactivity, was feeling the pressure ahead of the Malaysia clash, when Prannoy would offer her some advice. “Prannoy bhaiyya said if you feel pressure, just scream. You saw I’ve been screaming till yesterday!” the youngster laughs, adding she played unafraid as a changed strategy worked against Malaysia where the Indians downed World No. 5 Tan-Muralitharan.
Dealing with pressure
While the duo had been confident against Hong Kong and approached the China tie with a “no option but to win” attitude, Gayatri admits there was pressure. “There was definitely pressure because it was China, we knew it wouldn’t be easy. But we fought till the end,” she said.

With regular partner Satwiksairaj Rankireddy injured, Shetty had the additional responsibility to guide Kapila, and assume the leadership role on court. The two had been training together for a month, but early hiccups were expected.
“I wanted to prove that I was worth putting in the team,” Kapila said, adding that conditions were difficult to adjust to, even before it came to the combination. “Courts were very slippery, and the shuttle was whizzing too fast and tough to control initially.”
Syncing up with Shetty needed another adjustment. Shetty tends to rush to the net at lightning pace, something MR Arjun, Kapila’s regular partner, doesn’t. “Coach Mathias (Boe) told us ‘you can’t always have the same game all the time so don’t stress about it. Just be as quick as possible,” Shetty said.
India were 0-2 and a game down in men’s doubles against Hong Kong before the medal even appeared on the horizon. “We were leading but lost the first game. The start of the second was important because the momentum was with Hong Kong. Against China, down 13-6, Dhruv started his flick serve and China were left guessing. We were level in no time. But each time we made errors, we would regroup,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Boe has also brought a sense of simplicity to doubles, where he encourages players to play it straight always and not get too complicated and artsy with the shuttle. ‘Don’t do too much’ seems to be the advice.
From Shetty, Kapila would also learn to mould the mindset to focus on their match and not allow other results to interfere with their morale. “From him, I learnt how to manage pressure. Against Malaysia I gave away 3-4 points, but Chirag said let it be. Against China, from 12-7 down we led 13-12. His faith and confidence in me from earlier helped in the next match,” Kapila said.
Chirag-Satwik have also brought about a change in how doubles is viewed in team events. “Since 2018 when they won the Thailand Open and recently French, we all started believing doubles can win big too. Treesa-Gayatri have been good in women’s doubles. Arjun and I train with Chirag-Satwik, and not just hang around. They are short sessions but we learn much,” Kapila explains.
Celebrations have been kept at bay, because it was only a bronze. “Because we didn’t win,” Kapila ends. Sudirman Cup next.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/team-spirit-strength-in-doubles-brings-medal-in-asian-mixed-team-badminton-8454973/,sports
"Ranji triumph is a fitting tribute to Chintu, one of Saurashtra’s favourite sons: Unadkat","""Like I'd said before it's a fitting tribute to one of Saurashtra's favourite sons, Chintu (Pujara's nickname). He played his 100th Test for India against Australia in Delhi, but he was equally eager, wishing us all throughout,"" Unadkat said.","Saurashtra skipper Jaydev Unadkat on Sunday dedicated the team’s Ranji Trophy triumph to India veteran Cheteshwar Pujara and called him one of the region’s favourite sons.
Pujara hit the winning run against Australia in his milestone 100th Test in Delhi.
“Like I’d said before it’s a fitting tribute to one of Saurashtra’s favourite sons, Chintu (Pujara’s nickname). He played his 100th Test for India against Australia in Delhi, but he was equally eager, wishing us all throughout,” Unadkat said.
Pujara is the 13th Indian cricketer to play 100 Tests or more. He made his debut in 2010 and has scored over 7000 runs in his 13-year-long Test career.
On the latest triumph, Unadkat, who led the team to three premier domestic titles across formats in as many years, said “this decade and era belongs” to Saurashtra.
Saurashtra defeated Bengal by nine wickets in a replay of the 2020 final to win the Ranji Trophy for the second time. This was also their second title this season, having stamped their authority in the one-day format by claiming the Vijay Hazare Trophy in December.
“It was important to win this one to prove the dominance and to show everyone that this era, the decade belongs to Saurashtra,” Unadkat told reporters after their triumph.

“Three trophies in three years proves that we have been doing a lot of things right. We have set a tone, I’m really proud what this team has achieved.” The 31-year-old, who made a dream Test comeback after 12 years in Bangladesh last year, was busy with India’s series against Australia. But Unadkat was “granted” permission to play the Ranji final.
“At the moment, I feel that my body is in a good shape. The ball is coming out nicely off the hand. I’m able to bowl long spells which is crucial.” Want to create a legacy for Saurashtra
Asked about his goal, he said: “It’s not just about winning trophies, but creating a legacy for our team which will leave a bigger impact on cricket in the region.
“Our goal will be to carry forward this legacy for at least 3-4 years till the core of our team is intact.” Saurashtra won their maiden Ranji title three years back on the basis of a first-innings lead over Bengal on their home turf of Rajkot.
ADVERTISEMENT
“A lot of guys said the wickets suited us better, but that wasn’t the case.
“All the credit to the guys for showing such dominance in a crucial game like the final. It’s not easy. There’s always pressure on everyone to win the final.” With their pace-heavy attack on an Eden greentop, it was the home side that started as favourites. No team could surpass 350 against Bengal this season but, in the summit clash, Saurashtra got past the 400-mark as the Bengal pacers failed to make use of a lively pitch.
Bengal’s batters, too, were a big letdown as their first-innings ended at 174 after Unadkat won a good toss.
“With all talks about bowling lineup that they have not given more than 348 in the tournament, it’s a great statement (by our batters) to achieve that in a game like final.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We bowled in the right areas to start with, better than their bowlers a lot of times. Batters showed more composure and resilience. we won a lot more sessions than them, that’s why we came out on top.” Unadkat further said Bengal were under pressure and the visitors handled the situation more calmly.

"Ashwin-Jadeja: Yin and Yang, AC-DC, a deadly pair that cannot be unhyphenated",IND vs AUS: Both spinners’s strike rate and average are better when they bowl in tandem rather than with others. Together they have knocked down 462 wickets at 21 in 45 Tests.,"The wind was up at the Kotla, blowing under the hazy sun when Steve Smith crunched Ravindra Jadeja through covers, in the seventh over of the day. Jadeja stood puzzled, puffing his cheeks. From mid-on, his partner in Australia ship-wreck Ashwin gestured something. Jadeja just kept nodding his head and altered his field, stationing a man in short cover. The moment captured the essence of their equation—they don’t talk too often on the field, they are rarely spotted together, they are seldom seen cheering each other and they don’t feature in each other’s celebration reels either. The warmest of relations might not always express their feelings outwardly.
There’s always been that competitive streak to them, too, but you cannot imagine Ashwin without Jadeja, or Jadeja without Ashwin. You feel the void, you miss the soulful duet they strum together. The pair cannot be unhyphenated, and it’s high time they are bracketed among the finest bowling tag-teams in history, like Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, James Anderson and Stuart Broad, Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson.

IND vs AUS: ‘We played cross-batted shots which isn’t our preferred method’ says Pat Cummins,"As many as five Australian batters, including vice-captain Steve Smith, were guilty of playing across the line to deliveries that were consistently keeping low.","Not every batter is comfortable playing a high-percentage risk shot like sweep and reverse sweep and that’s where some of his teammates perhaps “went out of their methods”, was skipper Pat Cummins’ observation after Australia’s demoralising six-wicket defeat against India in the second Test.
As many as five Australian batters, including vice-captain Steve Smith, were guilty of playing across the line to deliveries that were consistently keeping low.
“I thought they (India) bowled really well. It’s not easy out there, but perhaps some guys went away from their methods,” Cummins said after the match.
Cummins feels that the “one size fits all” approach isn’t the right way to go about as far as batting on these tracks are concerned.
“Each batter has their own way to go about it. I don’t think there’s any one size fits all rule. Unfortunately, quite a few of us got out with kind of cross batted shots which might not be our preferred method,” Cummins further explained.
There are two things about batting – tempo and method. For Cummins, the high tempo needs to be balanced by the correct method.
“Two big things we talk about is the tempo of the game and the method. Maybe at times, we were a little bit too high on tempo,” said Cummins, who does not mind that approach.
“I would rather be high tempo than low tempo though. To be honest, those wickets were being difficult but maybe the method went a little bit away from what we planned to do at times.” Cummins had to admit that bating first was a good opportunity to score 300 plus which they “potentially” missed.
“Looking back on it, 300 would have been fantastic. 260 was ‘ok’ but if we really want to drive home the advantage we were a few short.” The Delhi game invoked similar feelings like Nagpur Test where Australia lost all 10 wickets in a session. On Sunday, they lost nine in just about 90 odd minutes in the morning.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s disappointing, this game was a similar story to Nagpur second innings. Felt like we were in a really good position for most of it, probably a few runs short in the end.
“In Nagpur maybe we underplayed. We probably overplayed it here at times in the second innings. You have got to find a way to try and put pressure back on the bowlers.
“They are really, really good bowlers, especially in these conditions.”
India’s lower-order did make difference
Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel in both games made the difference with their willows. Jadeja scored 70 in first game while Axar hit back-to-back half tons under pressure. Ashwin has been gutsy in both innings that he played.
ADVERTISEMENT
Cummins acknowledged the effort of the Indian lower order. Two back-to back hundred plus partnerships for the eighth wicket (Axar-Jadeja in Nagpur, Axar-Ashwin in Delhi) actually became a decisive factor.
“Again they batted very well. They are guys who have scored Test hundreds and batted really well. I thought our plans were pretty sound most of the time but unfortunately, they built partnerships.

Last evening, the Indian spinners, for the first time in this series, had not looked menacing. Aussie opener Travis Head had scored an almost run-a-ball 39 that had 5 fours and 1 six. Marnus Labuschagne too had looked threatening. The pitch too seemed to be easing. Axar Patel, after the day’s play, had said that the surface was getting slower. Was it time to press the panic button? That is exactly what, according to Rohit, they didn’t want the three spinners to do. He spoke about how the team paused, regrouped and struck again.
“Sometimes you’ve got to keep it simple, not to complicate too much. Yesterday we bowled about 12 or 13 overs and they were 62, which is more than five and a half. And I could see that we were panicking a little bit, we were trying to change fields way too many times, but in the morning we just wanted to tell those three guys (Ravindra Jadeja, Ravi Ashwin and Axar) to keep it calm, we don’t need to change fields as often as we did last evening. We keep it there, we keep it tight, and let the batters make that mistake,” he said.

Low bounce does them in
Former India player Mohammad Kaif, part of Star Sports commentary team for this series, made a pertinent point about the batting approach at the business end of the Test match. “Batting during the final moments of the Test is less about what is your head position, it is more about what is your ‘mind position’,” he said during the first session between his commentary stint.
This was when Australia were losing wickets, and probably their patience too. Labuschagne had a close shave while reverse sweeping, Steve Smith wasn’t that lucky when trying the conventional sweep. Other top-order batsmen to get out sweeping were Matt Renshaw and Alex Carrey. Skipper Pat Cummins’s dismissal could be the most-traumatic for the Aussie fans. On the very first ball the tall pacer went for a heave-ho hit but missed the line and was bowled.
The reason for most Aussies getting out to the sweep shot was the low bounce. Starting with Smith, their bat swing was too high and the lack of bounce did them in. Rohit touched upon the importance of shot-selection on Indian tracks.
“Some particular shots needed to be focussed on. What sort of shots to play. In Nagpur, we were playing on red soil, and on red soil, you need to employ a different technique. Here, it’s black soil, so the technique is different. We knew that playing the sweep is not a good option here. The safer option would be to step down and play straight. That’s my opinion. Other batters may have a different approach but that’s what I thought would work here.”

Will KL Rahul play at Indore?
Will India retain their winning combination for the 3rd Test that starts on March 1? The more direct question is: Will KL Rahul, after two more modest outings at Kotla, retain his place in playing XI? The question becomes important since the opener Shubman Gill, is in red-hot form but is confined to drinks duty. Going by form, it’s a no-brainer that Gill should get preferred over Rahul. Even if the team management sticks to a conservative approach and gives the out-of-form proven player longer rope, time has run out for the team’s vice-captain. Captain Rohit, as expected, kept his playing XI plans for Indore close to the chest.
“Of late, there have been talks about his batting, but for us as team management, we always look at the potential of every individual, not just KL. I was asked in the past about a lot of players, but if the guy has potential, they will get that extended run. Anyone. If you look at the couple of hundreds he got outside India. Of late, there has been criticism but from us, it was clear that we want him to go out and play his game. When you’re playing on pitches like this you need to find your methods of scoring runs. Different individuals are part of this team and they will have different ways of scoring runs. Finding your own method is important. We are not going to look too much into what one individual is doing, we’re going to see how the team is doing, how everyone comes together. This is an important series for us.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-a-pre-match-rohit-sharma-rahul-dravid-huddle-turned-the-tables-on-australia-8454853/,sports
IND vs AUS: Second Test victory sees India tighten grip on qualification for WTC Final,"The World Test Championship (WTC) has seen two years of intense competition in the longest format, and the second Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy characterised the ebb and flow that has been present throughout.","The race to qualification for the ICC World Test Championship Final took another turn on Sunday as India claimed a six-wicket victory over Australia to move a step closer to sealing their place in the June 7 game at The Oval.
The World Test Championship (WTC) has seen two years of intense competition in the longest format, and the second Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy characterised the ebb and flow that has been present throughout, with both sides wrestling for control of the match before Rohit Sharma’s men triumphed on a dramatic day in Delhi.
With the top two teams in the WTC standings securing a place in June’s Final, the result still means that Australia and India control their own destiny as they edge towards the conclusion of the competition, the ICC said in a release.
Australia remain atop the standings despite the defeat reducing their percentage tally to 66.67%, while India widened the gap between themselves and third spot thanks to their victory in Delhi, moving to 64.06%.
As a result of India’s victory, the number of teams able to qualify for the Final shrinks from four to three. South Africa drop out of contention, unable to reach the percentage points required to break into the top two, leaving Sri Lanka as the lone challenger for a place in the Final.
Sri Lanka currently sit third in the standings on 53.33%, and they head to New Zealand next month knowing that not only must they win both Tests in their two-match series to stand any chance of qualification, but they are also reliant on favourable results in the remaining Tests between India and Australia.
The third Test between India and Australia starts in Indore on March 1 with the hosts able to secure their place at The Oval with another victory. Anything less, and Australia will become the first team to qualify for the WTC Final.

"IND vs AUS: Disappointed and shell-shocked: Border, Hayden slam Australia’s disastrous batting display","The visitors were blown away by spin bowling in the first session. They lost six batters, including Steve Smith, Matthew Renshaw, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins and Matthew Kuhnemann, to sweep and reverse-sweep shots.","Shell-shocked, Australian legends Allan Border and Matthew Hayden have lambasted Pat Cummins an Co. for their second innings collapse in the Delhi Test against India, where pre-determined sweep shots led to their downfall.
Leading by 62 runs, Australia started the morning session of day three with a slight advantage.
However, the visitors were blown away by spin bowling in the first session. They lost six batters, including Steve Smith, Matthew Renshaw, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins and Matthew Kuhnemann, to sweep and reverse-sweep shots.
In 90 minutes, Australia went from 65/1 to 113 all out.
Former captain Border felt Australia panicked and none of the batters tried to defend.
“I’m disappointed, I’m shell-shocked, I’m angry about the way we went about our work today,” Border said on Fox Cricket.
“It was panicky, frenetic batting. No one tried to get in there and stem the flow with some good defensive cricket. They were just getting out playing sweep shots, reverse sweeps to just about every ball.
“You just can’t get away with that on this sort of track. You’ve got to have a method where you play within your limitations. You’re not playing on a flat belter where you can expand your game.

“When playing on a difficult surface, you’ve got to work out where your scoring options are and bat some time at the crease.” Former opener Hayden couldn’t believe what he was seeing.
“I can’t believe what I’ve just witnessed … they’re world class players, and they’ve got everything to win in this session, and everything to lose,” Hayden said during commentary on Fox Cricket.
“They did it so well last (night) in those few overs, strong scoring rate, good defence, proactive batting, but what we’ve seen here is a disaster for Australia.
“It’s a disaster because they’ve gone way over the edge in terms of their aggressive play.” Hayden was particularly furious over Cummins, who despite seeing wickets tumbling like nine pins went for a big sweep only to get out on the first ball. Hayden felt the skipper should have read the game better.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You’ve got to think on your feet plus read the game.
“You’ve got about 13 people in that dugout that aren’t playing the game, all having their say on it, and what they would have said knowing the trend of this venue is that first session is tricky – it’s not like the last session of day two, where the conditions slide on, ball is hard, drier wicket.” “It’s a little tacky this morning, so think! And then plan in the middle accordingly as a partnership,” Hayden said.
Former batter Mike Hussey felt the current squad just blew the chance of keeping the series alive as India won the match by six wickets to retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy.

Napoli’s unconventional rise a riposte to star-driven club culture based on big money,"Italian side sold their biggest names, but shrewd scouting and out-of-the-box coaching have taken to the top of Serie A and good results in Europe","Thirty-two years after Diego Maradona inspired Napoli to their last scudetto, the Serie A toppers this season have discovered ‘Kvaradona’. Not as flamboyant or colourful, the 22-year-old from the Georgian town of Batumi on the edge of the Black Sea, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has steered them to the brink of their first league title since the heyday of the Argentine.
Naples’ supporters hold banners during the Serie A match between Napoli and Cremonese at the Diego Armando Maradona stadium in Naples, Italy. (AP)
Kvaratskhelia and Maradona are vastly different players, in style, position and stature. But their influence has been similar in lifting the mood and fortunes of the club. The Georgian has scored 12 and assisted in 14 goals in 24 games in all competitions. But how he, a hybrid-playmaker winger, slipped through the radar of Europe’s richest clubs and smartest scouts, is a mystery. Therein lies the most fascinating narrative of Napoli’s resurgence.
The club signed him for a mere 10 million pounds from Georgian club Dinamo Matumi. Then, how Napoli are topping the table is baffling. It was not meant to be. They went against all strains of conventional wisdom — contrarian and impetuous like their greatest hero, Maradona. This summer, against the wishes of the fans, they shipped out their best and loved players. Napoli is a sentimental club, investing emotionally in the players they like (and making their bitterness evident to those they don’t). In Maradona’s days, the supporters used to take turns to invite them home and even collect money to fund player transfers. Players who liked the club, and who the supporters would love back, clung on. But cutting the chord of nostalgia was the first step in their reboot. Dries Meretens, 34, wanted to end his career at the club, but was refused an extension.
So it naturally angered the fans, especially the ultras, when they decided to sell Lorenzo Insigne, Kalidou Koulibaly, Mertens and Fabian Ruiz — the captain, vice-captain, their highest-ever goalscorer and their midfield general, jettisoned not because their eccentric coach Luciano Spalletti wanted a churn to rebuild the side but because the club wanted to make a quick buck before their contracts expired. Beneath what could be perceived as madness was a method — three of them were in their 30s, injury-prone and nearly past their prime, Ruiz, 26, had just one year left in his contract.
But the bitterness lingered. More so after the club had finished third last season, after their season of rejuvenation under Spalletti, their third manager in four years, after Gennaro Gattuso and Carlo Ancelotti. Instead, they shipped in a bunch of then unknowns in bargain deals. Their net profit in the transfer window was 13 million pounds, in a milieu where clubs are coughing up billions to buy superstars that could make them invulnerable, at a time when most elite clubs are no longer bothered about the economics of the transfer window, in an era where only money could buy titles.
Substance over stardom
Apart from Kvaradona, they purchased the dynamic Nigeria striker Victor Osimhen, now much sought after in Europe, South Korea international Kim Min-jae, Uruguayan defender Mathías Olivera, Macedonian midfielder Eljif Elmas, Mexican attacker Chucky Lozano, Tottenham discard Tanguy Ndombele on loan, Giovanni Simeone and Giacomo Raspadori.

The fans were displeased and threatened to boycott games if the club didn’t splash money in the market. The ultra groups protested; fans raised “wake up” slogans during games and training. But the management did not waver and slip into panic buys, or importing past-their-peak players from England or Spain, the sort that shifts to the Italian league these days, a league that no longer attracts the best talents of Europe in their prime. It’s either a semi-retirement locale or talent-announcing platform.

But the agony of the supporters soon turned to joy, as Spalletti’s men made an instant impression, playing the most attractive football in the country, the essence of it Spalletti describing as “beautiful rejection of structured football.” His teams are loosely shaped in attacking 4-3-3, though it assumes different shapes throughout a game. In his rejection of conventional norms, he is a revolutionary. “Systems no longer exist in football, it’s all about the spaces left by the opposition. You must be quick to spot them and know the right moment to strike, have the courage to start the move even when pressed,” he once explained the crux of his philosophy.

Whatever be the complexities and ambiguities of the formation, Napoli played attractive football, lost just one match, and midway through the season, they sit 18 points above second-placed Inter Milan. The protesting fans are singing hymns of praise. Their success spreads beyond Italy — they grabbed full points in all but one of their six UEFA Champions League games, topping a group that included Liverpool (whom they hammered 4-1), Ajax and Rangers, which is clearly a better indication of their progress.

The success in Europe foretells a longer and brighter fortune, rather than a one-off fairytale narrative. Their foundations are strong, the structure is robust, and if they manage to stave off advances from richer European clubs vying for new talents, they could enjoy a golden spell in both the country and the continent. It could, in turn, rejuvenate Serie A from the clutches of mediocrity, restore the lost glory of the league. Europe has missed an Italian powerhouse since the slide of AC Milan in the late aughts. Juventus shone but sporadically, but Italian clubs had long lost their fear and aura. Napoli and Kvaradona could change that.
But significantly, Napoli has shown how shrewd scouting, smart transfer policies and competent managing are still relevant in these days of plucking and assembling players with fat transfer fees and cheques, that there is still a place for humble clubs like Napoli in the landscape of European football.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/napolis-unconventional-rise-serie-a-club-culture-8453541/,sports

IND vs AUS: ‘We are very lucky to have Rohit take over leadership from someone like Virat’ says Dravid,Rohit took over after Kohli quit as India's Test captain following a series defeat in South Africa in January 2021.,"India head coach Rahul Dravid on Sunday said the team was “very lucky” to have someone like Rohit Sharma taking over the captaincy from a player of the calibre of Virat Kohli.
Rohit took over after Kohli quit as India’s Test captain following a series defeat in South Africa in January 2021.
Hailing Rohit’s captaincy after India retained the Boder-Gavaskar Trophy with a six-wicket win over Australia in the second Test here on Sunday, Dravid said the Mumbaikar has the respect of the dressing room.
“He is one of those guys who has been there a long time. The kind of person who doesn’t speak a lot, but when he does they all listen.
“He deeply cares a lot about the dressing room and the players. We are very lucky to have Rohit take over the leadership from someone like Virat,” Dravid said after the match.
Skipper Rohit hailed the spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin for “finishing” the job for India.
Jadeja returned with a career-best 7/42 and, along with Ravichandran Ashwin (3/59), accounted for all the wickets to bundle out Australia for a paltry 113 in their second innings.

“Looking at how things were yesterday, the way we came back and finished our job was great,” Rohit said at the post-match presentation.
“Even if we were just one run behind, I felt we were trailing because we had to bat last.
“The bowlers were fantastic, to take nine wickets today morning is commendable. And then we finished the job with the bat.” From being overnight 61/1, Australia were bundled out in the first session of the third day.
“Every game you play in this type of weather, there is some moisture. What I noticed is there is a lot to offer in the first session, but as it goes on it gets slower and there isn’t enough bite.
“So our focus was keeping it tight in the morning, and these guys are the masters of bowling in these conditions.
ADVERTISEMENT
“On a pitch like this, people need to do something different. We were prepared for them coming out and playing shots.
“Our idea was to not panic and just hit the right areas, waiting for the mistake to happen and that’s exactly what happened.” Rohit said the partnerships between Jadeja-Virat Kohli and Axar Patel-Ashwin gave them the winning edge.
“There are lot of moments across four innings, but I thought the partnership between Jadeja and Virat, and then Axar-Ash was brilliant.
That’s a big help because of the balance we have created for ourselves.” Dravid said: “We wanted to chase something close to 200-225 and that partnership enabled us to get back, or we’d have been trailing.” Dravid further said their bowlers leaked too many runs in the final session of day two and credited them for coming back in the first session on Sunday.

India look for big win against lowly Ireland to qualify for Women’s T20 WC semis,"After the 11-run loss to England on Saturday, their first defeat in the showpiece, India are in second spot with four points from three matches behind England (six points from three straight wins) who have qualified for the semifinals.","A defeat against England denting their confidence, India will look to bounce back with a big win against lowly Ireland to remain in contention for a semifinal berth in the Women’s T20 World Cup, here on Monday.
After the 11-run loss to England on Saturday, their first defeat in the showpiece, India are in second spot with four points from three matches behind England (six points from three straight wins) who have qualified for the semifinals.
The Harmanpreet Kaur-led side will now need not only a win against Ireland in their last group match on Monday but also a big one to have any chance of filling up the remaining semifinal spot from Group 2.
They need to improve their net run rate from the current + 0.205.
Pakistan, who have lost to India in their opening match, have two points from two matches and they also have a chance to make it to the last four if they win their last two matches. In that case, they will also have six points.
Currently, Pakistan, who play against the West Indies Sunday night, have a better NRR of +1.542 than that of India, though they are yet to face England who have a NNR of +1.776.
Ireland, on the other hand, are already out of contention for a semifinal berth, having lost all their three matches.
ADVERTISEMENT
To win big against Ireland, the Indian batting will need to fire, especially captain Harmanpreet and opener Shafali Verma, as both have not played a significant knock so far.
Harmanpreet’s scores in the three matches so far have been 16, 33 and 4, below par by her standards, while Shafali have made 33, 28 and 8.
Young Richa Ghosh has been the most consistent batter for India with scores of 31, 44 and 47 not out, and she would be looking to continue with her good form against Ireland.
After her match-winning knock of 53 not out against arch-rivals Pakistan, Jemimah Rodrigues has scored 1 and 13 in the next two matches, and she would look to make the most out of a relatively weaker Irish attack.
ADVERTISEMENT
An impressive 52-run knock from vice captain Smriti Mandhana, though in a lost cause, against England also bodes well for India as she can put the Ireland bowlers to sword if they fail to keep it tight.
In the bowling department, the 5/15 against England — her career-best — should spur pacer Renuka Singh to get more against Ireland while the seasoned Deepti Sharma had been the most consistent Indian bowler so far.
India would expect a much better show from seasoned left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad who is without a wicket after three matches while Pooja Vastrakar and Radha Yadav also need to contribute more than what they have done so far in the tournament.
For Ireland, top-order batter Orla Prendergast has been in good nick with 109 runs from three matches, while Gaby Lewis has scored 84 in total from the same number of matches.

Cara Murray and Arlene Kelly have taken three wickets apiece and they will be wary of the strong Indian batting line-up.

‘We’ll continue to back him’: Rahul Dravid backs KL Rahul,"KL Rahul needs to trust his processes, says Rahul Dravid.","Team India head coach Rahul Dravid on Sunday said that the team management has complete trust in KL Rahul’s class and will continue to back the out-of-form opener.
KL Rahul failed again after getting dismissed for 17 in India’s 1st innings and 1 in the second. With Shubman Gill waiting in the wings India’s Test team vice-captain is under fire.
“I think he needs to trust his processes,” Dravid told the broadcasters.
“This is just a phase, he has been one of our most successful overseas openers. He’s got hundreds in South Africa and England, we’ll continue to back him.
“I believe he has the quality and class to come out of this. It is great working with this unit, managing formats is the most difficult part. But there’s not a lot of technical coaching, just simple conversations and challenging them, and giving them a pat on the back when they do well,” he said.
Former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad once again ripped into KL Rahul’s inclusion in the Indian Test team, branding the batter’s run as “torrid”.
A few days ago, Prasad had tweeted that Rahul’s place in the team was based not on performance but favouritism.

“Rahul’s selection is not based on performance but favouritism. Has been consistently inconsistent and for someone who has been around for 8 years not converted potential into performances,” Prasad had written on Twitter.
Rahul’s saga of failures led to questions from experts including Sunil Gavaskar and Mark Waugh as well. According to Gavaskar, Rahul has a mental block and doesn’t know whether to go forward or back.

Technology does take time to full-proof on-field decisions, it hampers the flow of play and football fans hate it. But as was evident on a warm Sunday morning at Kotla, in cricket, it’s a different story. Tech snags can even entertain.

"IND vs AUS: Swept away in 90 minutes: Harrowed Australia capitulate to the guile of Jadeja, Ashwin; India win by 6 wickets","IND vs AUS: Milestone man Cheteshwar Pujara, playing his hundredth Test, seals the famous comeback win","The milestone man Cheteshwar Pujara, playing his hundredth Test, cuffed Toddy Murphy’s ball through midwicket to wrap up a famous comeback victory for India at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground. Pujara pumped his fists in the air towards the dug-out under the Virat Kohli pavilion, and a split-second later, his teammates rushed to the ground elatedly. With his characteristic calm, despite the wobble around him, he ensured that India overhauled the target of 115 with six wickets in hand. The second win of the four-Test series means that India have placed one leg in the World Test Championship final.
Their broken Australian counterparts stood baffled, wondering how they contrived to lose a game they had dominated for long passages. The tourists would rue the 90 minutes and 110 balls of implosion in the first session on Sunday, where they lost nine wickets for 52 runs, a consequence of their indiscretion with the bat as well as the combined guiles of thel world’s most deceptive spin act—Ravindra Jadeja and Ravi Ashwin. “This one, hurts,” Australia’s captain Pat Cummins would say. His counterpart, Rohit Sharma would say: “Looking at how things were yesterday, the way we came back and finished our job was great. I think the bowlers were fantastic, to take 9 wickets today morning is commendable.”

The comeback began with his champion off-spinner Ashwin nailing Travis Head and then Steve Smith, before Jadeja did Jadeja things. That is to run through the batting order with his blend of accuracy and mastery of lengths, subtlety and aggression. The mere sight of him would tire Australia—in Nagpur, he scored 70 runs and nabbed seven wickets; here he whipped up 10 wickets, including his career best of 7/42, and scored 26 valuable runs in a low-scoring match. Both times he was the man of the match.
No one would have expected an early finish. The Sunday audience had hardly settled down on the seats than Australia’s capitulation set in. They might have come prepared for a long day of grind and haze, sweater and scarves to cover the evening chill, but they would reach home in time for a late lunch or tea. In a sense, Australia’s shuddering collapse gifted them a memorable day on the ground and family time in the evening.

Though Australia had breezed to 61 for one on Saturday, there was a sense of foreboding that they could collapse on Sunday. None perhaps would have expected chaos to descend so swiftly. Just six balls into the first over, Ashwin dislodged Head, whose 43 accounted for nearly half the runs the visitors eventually managed. The wily off-spinner, striking an irresistible length throughout the game, lured him into a drive with the inward drift from around the stump, dropped the ball shorter than where Head thought it would, then spun away devilishly to brush his edge.
Sense of foreboding
There was a sense of foreboding about his departure. His hyper-aggressive tactics were profitable in the last hour of the second day, but Sunday required a more old-fashioned approach. Head would not buy it, and encouraged by a cover-driven four off Ashwin, he tried to blast Ashwin out of the attack, and realised the inevitable futility of it.
That was just the start of what would be one of the most harrowing 90 minutes in the history of Australian cricket. The five overs between the exits of Head and Steve Smith was the fleeting hope-filler. But when Ashwin nailed Smith, Australia’s lone proven conquerer of the subcontinent, in front, chaos broke loose. Smith’s dismissal—trying to sweep on a pitch where the ball kept low and missing the swipe altogether—was a warning his colleagues did not heed to. They followed their talisman’s path into the abyss. No one demonstrated the patience to stick, grind the runs and dishevel the bowler’s lengths and lines.
As difficult a proposition it is to survive Jadeja and Ashwin on a deck with invariable bounce and cracks beginning to enlarge, as daunting a task it is to outwit the two most skilled spinners in the world, Australia’s batsmen did little to make their own lives easier. It was as though before they hunt you down, they will kill themselves. Even the nerves of the usually composed Marnus Labuschagne snapped, as he attempted to late-cut the stiflingly stump-to-stump Ravindra Jadeja and could only toe-end the ball back onto the stumps. Late cuts on a turning, low track is as risky as it could get, and uncharacteristic of batsman of Labuschagne’s game-awareness and skillset. Seeing his splattered stumps, he looked skywards and cursed himself. He could have seen the fabled Australian virtues of tenacity and resilience drift aimlessly in the hazy skies.

Until then, he was batting with the comfort and composure of someone who had tamed the surface and bowlers, sweeping and reverse-sweeping the spinners with aplomb, making them resort to defensive lines and injecting panic in the field. At that juncture Australia were just a sturdy stand away from dictating the game. All they required was some sensible batting, not gift wickets, hang around and wait patiently for the ball to get older and then punish the Indian spinners. Instead, they tried to Bazball their way out of trouble. Enchanting and contagious could be England’s ultra-aggressive approach, but the context and conditions were far from ideal. A half-baked approach could only invite more embarrassment. At the heart of their self-destruction shone confusion. Muddled-heads and stiff bodies—a walking manual on how not to play in the subcontinent.
From that point—at 85 for four and their two best batsmen in the dugout—they swiftly unravelled, crashing like a derailed freight train. The score on 95 for three, they lost four wickets in the space of only 10, each of the four batsmen attempting a hideous shot. After Labuschagne’s late-cut gone awry, Renshaw chose to sweep and informed the bowler of his intentions prematurely. A long stride down the ground did not suffice, as Ashwin pulled his anarchy back a trifle to trap him leg before the wicket. Unable to wrap his head around the chaos around him, Peter Handscombe drove loosely and outside-edged to Virat Kohli at slips. A disjointed Pat Cummins heaved ungainly, failed to connect his bat on ball, and saw Jadeja celebrating his fifth wicket with a cackle and fist-pump.

After a 23-ball respite, the pavilion-ward march continued. Alex Carey swept to his doom, like a self-fulfilling prophecy, and Australia folded up for 113, a collapse even more shocking and galling than the Nagpur roll-out. From the successive second-innings collapses, and not exceedingly unplayable wickets, the redemption road in the series is long and forlorn for Australia.

"Saurashtra beat Bengal by nine wickets in Ranji final, clinch second title","Having given away a big first innings lead of 230 runs, Bengal, who were overnight 169/4 in their second essay, folded for 241, handing the visitors a mere 12 runs target to win the final.","Left-arm pacer Jaydev Unadkat returned a match haul of nine wickets, including 6/85 in the second innings, as Saurashtra thrashed Bengal by nine wickets in the summit clash to clinch their second Ranji Trophy title on Sunday.
Having given away a big first innings lead of 230 runs, Bengal, who were overnight 169/4 in their second essay, folded for 241, handing the visitors a mere 12 runs target to win the final.
Saurashtra lost their opening batter Jay Gohil (0) off the bowling of Akash Deep but eventually went past the target, reaching 14 for 1 in 2.4 overs, to wrap up the match with one day and two full sessions to spare.
Saurashtra’s earlier triumph was in 2019-20 season when they defeated Bengal on the basis of first innings lead. In the last 10 seasons, they have made the final on five occasions, underlining their consistency.
A Ranji Trophy title eluded Bengal yet again. They last won it in 1998-90 when they defeated a star-studded Delhi at the same Eden Gardens. Their first title had come in 1938-39 in the pre-independence era.

Earlier in the morning session, Unadkat showed the way after a freak run-out of Bengal batter Shahbaz Ahmed (27). The veteran Saurashtra skipper added four wickets to his overnight tally of two.
The old Bengal warhorse duo of skipper Manoj Tiwary (68) and Anustup Majumdar (61) slammed valiant half-centuries but the home side were let down by their top-order batters, including the promising Abhimanyu Easwaran who scored 0 and 16 in the two innings.
In-form No. 3 batter Sudip Gharami, who is fresh from a 112 and 41 in the semifinal against Madhya Pradesh and has 800-plus runs this season, also came a cropper and scored 0 and 14 in the two innings.

The decision to hand debut to Sumanta Gupta in a Ranji final also will rankle Bengal as he did not show any technique of a top-order batter and perished to an outgoing delivery.
State sports minister-cum-cricketer Tiwary had delayed his retirement to win a Ranji title from his fourth final, and it remains to be seen whether he continue to play in the upcoming season.
Earlier, the overnight duo of Tiwary and Shahbaz Ahmed committed hara-kiri while going for a third run. Ahmed had to sacrifice his wicket to give Saurahshtra their first breakthrough of the day.
It also unsettled Tiwary as he followed suit and got out for 68 after chasing a wide delivery from Unadkat. In no time, Bengal were reduced to 205/9, still trailing by 25 runs.

But, Bengal’s last pair of Mukesh Kumar and Ishan Porel avoided the ignominy of an innings defeat, scoring 36 runs in 37 balls to delay the inevitable.
Unadkat, who was released from the Indian Test side to play in the Ranji final, had bagged 3/44 in the Bengal first innings. He was ably supported by fellow left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya (3/33) after they opted to bowl on a lively pitch.
Having prepared a green-top, Bengal were caught in their own web as their top-order batters showed complete lack of application on the opening day.
Brief Scores:
Bengal 174 and 241 in 70.4 overs (Manoj Tiwary 68, Anustup Majumdar 61; Jaydev Unadkat 6/85, Chetan Sakariya 3/76).

‘Australia panicked … sweeping on that sort of pitch’: Allan Border and Hayden slam Australian batting,IND vs AUS: Australia lost 9 wickets for just 52 runs today in 19.1 overs on a frenetic day 3 morning and the former players questioned the sweep shot on a pitch where the ball kept low.,"IND vs AUS: Even as several Australia batsmen fell, trying for the big shots, Dinesh Karthik and Matthew Hayden questioned their mindset. In particular, their sweep shots on such a low surface.
“It’s a good option here but you need to know how. Can’t get too far beside the line. Need to come along the line of the ball,” Matthew Hayden started it off on Australia’s sweep shot tactic.
Then Dinesh Karthik said, “If Australia had a blueprint, then it should have been NOT to play a sweep shot too much here on this surface where the ball has kept low.”
Hayden added, “Definitely not every ball. It’s part of your arsenal but it also needs to be backed up by smarts. What we’ve seen here is a disaster for Australia. They’ve gone way over the edge in terms of their aggressive play.”
Karthik then questioned the plan itself.

“Couple of others didn’t trust their defense. They came out swinging and swinging hard. When you try to do that – when you have already planned in the dressing room, this is how I am going to bat, that can get you in trouble. You come in, you assess the conditions as you deem fit on that day, you have a batting plan and then you adjust according to what’s been presented to you. If you have decided it yesterday, that’s going to get you in trouble.”
Hayden said he agreed with DK’s views. “100 percent, I back that. Very very good explanation. What’s coming in front of you has no relevance to what’s coming next. Or what’s gone behind you. You can only play moment by moment.”
Karthik then talked about how the batsmen would have felt when in the dressing room, watching things unfold. “In these kinds of pitches, when you are sitting outside, you are going to come in, you always get a feeling there is a lot happening, how are you going to play, are you going to get out as soon as that happens.”

Allan Border questioned the choice of sweeping. ”They panicked, and you can’t tell me that the reverse sweep or sweeping on that sort of pitch is the ideal way of scoring your runs,” he told Fox Cricket. “There’s got to be another method on that surface other than the highest-risk shot. Why are they going to that shot so often?”

Mike Hussey too concurred. “They will be bitterly disappointed. Coming into today, they were in front of this test match – nine wickets in hand with a 60 odd run lead, he said. “Unfortunately they just gave it away … a lot of them gave their wickets away to the Indians. “Yep they bowled well, but I feel as though they gave them their wickets.”
Sanjay Manjrekar said perhaps Australia felt after what happened in Nagpur, they thought they needed a pre-game plan on how to bat aggressively here but re-iterated Karthik’s statement that if they had one strategy it should have been not to over-d- the sweep shot on a low surface.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-2nd-test-day-3-karthik-hayden-slam-australia-collapse-8453776/,sports

Brittney Griner re-signs with Phoenix Mercury,"Griner, who was a free agent, re-signed with the Mercury on a one-year contract according to a person familiar with the deal.","Brittney Griner is headed back to the Phoenix Mercury.
Griner, who was a free agent, re-signed with the Mercury on a one-year contract according to a person familiar with the deal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Saturday because no announcement has been made.
The 32-year-old Griner had said she would return to Phoenix in a social media post in December, after she returned home from her 10-month ordeal in Russia that included time in a Russian jail. Griner had been arrested at an airport just outside of Moscow on drug possession charges a year ago and was brought home in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange in December.

The 6-foot-9 center last played for the Mercury in 2021 and helped the team reach the WNBA Finals. She averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 rebounds that season.
The website “Her Hoops Stats” was the first to report Griner’s signing.
Griner, who was drafted No. 1 in 2013 by the Mercury, was listed Saturday on Phoenix’s roster on the WNBA website.
Since returning home from Russia, Griner has been out of the public spotlight, with the exception of appearances at the Super Bowl, the Phoenix Open and an MLK Day event in Phoenix, where she lives.
She skipped a USA Basketball training camp earlier this month, but the organization made it clear she could take all the time she needed to decide if she wanted to play for the U.S. again.

The WNBA has said it will address getting Griner special travel accommodations, such as charter flights, after she signed.
“We are very cognizant of BG’s unique situation,” WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told the AP earlier this month. “We’ve been planning and we’ve been thinking it through with security experts, BG’s side, our side. We’ll find the right time to comment on it when she signs with a team.”

Ashwin, an intelligent thinker of the game, was almost about to deliver the ball but withdrew at the last moment forcing Smith to scamper back into the crease.

"England continue ‘Bazball’ revolution, thrash New Zealand by 267 runs in first Test",It was a first Test victory for England in New Zealand since 2008.,"England’s “Bazball” revolution continued apace on Sunday when the tourists wrapped up a thumping 267-run victory over New Zealand in the opening session of the fourth day of the first test at Bay Oval on Sunday.
Still shellshocked after Stuart Broad’s brilliant spell with the pink ball on Saturday evening, only Daryl Mitchell of the last five Black Caps batsmen offer any real resistance as they folded to 126 all out in their second innings.
It was a first test victory for England in New Zealand since 2008 and a 10th win in 11 matches since former Black Caps skipper Brendon “Baz” McCullum and Christchurch-born Ben Stokes took over as coach and captain.
Broad laboured in vain to get his 20th five-wicket haul in tests and finished with figures of 4-49 but his partner James Anderson (4-18) stepped in to lead the mopping up of the New Zealand tail.
World test champions New Zealand had resumed on 63-5 with the mammoth task of chasing down 394 for victory but England quickly resumed their dominance of the previous evening.
Michael Bracewell lasted less than 10 minutes before he spooned a Jack Leach delivery to Harry Brook at midwicket without adding to his overnight tally of 25.
Scott Kuggeleijn came in and made two runs from six balls before being trapped in front by Anderson with skipper Tim Southee departing for a golden duck on the next delivery, prodding the ball to Joe Root in the slips.

Mitchell fended away Anderson’s hat-trick ball at the start of the England seamer’s next over and proceeded to stall the rout with an unbeaten 57 that got the hosts firmly into three figures.
Neil Wagner (9) at the other end gave Anderson his third wicket with an edge behind and debutant number 11 Blair Tickner scored eight runs, keeping Mitchell company in the final-wicket stand before Anderson took out his off stump.

The draw, which stretches Brentford’s unbeaten run in the Premier League to 11 games, sees Brentford remain in eighth place on 35 points, while Palace are 12th on 26.

After a promising start with some good early chances, the clash descended into a cat-and-mouse affair with both sides taking turns in possession but struggling to create decent goal-scoring chances.
Ivan Toney provoked an angry response from Palace defender Joachim Andersen in the 49th minute when he went down as he turned in the box looking for a penalty, with Andersen reading him the riot act as the referee waved away his appeals for a spot kick.
Eberechi Eze’s impact off the Palace bench was almost immediate, as he rose unmarked to head home a Michael Olise cross from close range in the 69th minute, and Brentford did little to suggest that they would be able to pull back a goal.
Despite looking toothless in attack, they somehow pulled it off in the sixth minute of stoppage time as substitute Janelt headed in a cross form Bryan Mbueno to send the home fans into raptures.

Facundo Buonanotte and Solly March both had the ball in the net for Brighton but were denied by offside flags.

Bournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 to move out of relegation zone
Bournemouth moved out of the Premier League relegation zone after a second-half goal from Marcus Tavernier guided them to a 1-0 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.
The south-coast club jumped from 19th to 17th on 21 points after 23 games, a point above the drop zone, after their first win since the World Cup break. Wolves stay in 15th place on 23.

The hosts started strongly at Molineux with several early forays into Bournemouth’s penalty area, but were unable to make the most of their momentum in the first half.

Pablo Sarabia and Adama Traore, who was a constant threat down the right, found the target with shots from tight angles, but their efforts were comfortably saved by Neto.
Gary O’Neil’s visitors began the second half on the front foot and were rewarded with a goal in the 50th minute as Dominic Solanke squared for Tavernier to bundle in with his thigh.
Wolves piled on the pressure as they desperately sought an equaliser and Ruben Neves stung Neto’s palm with a long-range effort in added time but Bournemouth stood firm to earn their first away clean sheet of the season.
Manchester City held at Forest to fall behind Arsenal in title race

Manchester City fell two points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal after being held to a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday.
Arsenal left it very late to beat Aston Villa 4-2 earlier on Saturday and climbed back to the top of the standings, putting pressure on City to earn victory at Forest, with the visitors starting the encounter at a blistering pace.
City dominated possession and deservedly took the lead four minutes before the break with Bernardo Silva slamming the ball into the net from the edge of the box.

The visitors should have doubled their advantage midway through the second half but the usually lethal Erling Haaland hit the crossbar from close range before blazing the rebound over the top.
That miss proved pivotal as, out of nowhere, Forest’s January signing Chris Wood tapped home at the far post to level six minutes from time and lift the roof off a damp City Ground.

The champions threw everything at Forest in search of a dramatic late winner but they could not break the hosts’ resistance, leaving City two points behind Arsenal having played one game more. Forest climbed to 13th.
Coleman earns Everton precious win over fellow strugglers Leeds
Everton defender Seamus Coleman’s goal from the tightest of angles secured a precious 1-0 victory over fellow Premier League strugglers Leeds United at Goodison Park on Saturday and moved the Merseyside club out of the relegation zone.
The decisive moment came after 64 minutes when Alex Iwobi sent Coleman clear down the flank and, with Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier expecting a cross, the right-back arrowed his shot into the net from virtually the byline.
It was a deserved win for Everton who created numerous opportunities but, as has been the case for much of the season, the league’s lowest scorers’ lack of quality in the attacking third meant too many shots, passes and crosses went astray.

"IND vs AUS: Torrid run continues, tweets Venkatesh Prasad on KL Rahul’s form",Rahul’s saga of failures led to questions from experts including Sunil Gavaskar and Mark Waugh as well.,"Former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad once again ripped into KL Rahul’s inclusion in the Indian Test team, branding the batter’s run as “torrid”.
A few days ago, Prasad had tweeted that Rahul’s place in the team was based not on performance but favouritism.
“Rahul’s selection is not based on performance but favouritism. Has been consistently inconsistent and for someone who has been around for 8 years not converted potential into performances,” Prasad had written on Twitter.
On Saturday, after Rahul had another forgettable outing with the bat where he was dismissed for 17 runs, Prasad took to Twitter again, quote tweeting his earlier thread and writing, “And the torrid run continues. More to do with rigidity of the management to persist with a player who just hasn’t looked the part. No top order batsman in atleast last 20 years of Indian cricket has played these many tests with such a low average. His inclusion is ….”

Rahul’s saga of failures led to questions from experts including Sunil Gavaskar and Mark Waugh as well. According to Gavaskar, Rahul has a mental block and doesn’t know whether to go forward or back.
“He doesn’t know whether to go back or come forward. With KL Rahul, he takes his front foot across and the ball is turning into you, you have to play with a straight bat but when you take your front foot across like that you are left with no choice but to play with an angled bat,” Gavaskar said on Star Sports.
“The chances of you missing the ball are more. Rohit takes the front foot away, so he allows the bat to come around and play the ball in front of the pad. That’s why you see Rohit Sharma look so secure and why Rahul looks tentative,” Gavaskar added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-ind-vs-aus-torrid-run-continues-tweets-venkatesh-prasad-on-kl-rahuls-form-8453266/,sports
ICC Women’s T20 World Cup: Renuka’s five-for not good enough for India Women,Pace bowler picks 5 for 15 but Nat Sciver and Amy Jones put enough runs on board as England win by 11 runs.,"Nat Sciver had already made headlines even before the T20 World Cup started. Before the tournament began, in a first, Nat and her partner and teammate Katherine Brunt announced that they would bring their married name Sciver-Brunt to cricket.
And just a few days into the tournament, she became the joint-costliest overseas player in the Women’s Premier League as Mumbai Indians bought her for Rs 3.2 crore.
Not even a week has gone by since the WPL player auctions and the money Mumbai Indians spent looks every bit priceless for Nat Sciver-Brunt single-handedly resurrected England against India on Saturday and all but ensuring that they will finish top of Group B and avoid Australia in the semifinal.

At 29/3, Renuka Thakur (5/15) had England on tenterhooks and with three spinners in the mix, India looked to have taken early control of the match. A win at Gqeberha would have given Harmanpreet Kaur & Co a genuine shot at finishing top of the Group and thereby avoiding facing Australia in the last four.
However, Nat had other plans. Even though momentum was very much on India’s side, the Tokyo-born Nat calmly turned the tide.
As England found themselves in trouble, she used the scoops, reverse-sweeps to good effect as India’s spinners – Deepti Sharma, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Radha Yadav — went for 76 runs in 9 overs and picked up just one wicket between them.
While Nat played herself in, she got excellent support from captain Heather Knight with whom she stitched a 51-run game-changing partnership for the fourth wicket. Even though Knight departed, wicketkeeper Amy Jones 27-ball 40 meant Nat got more support in the end as England put 151/7.

“She’s so unbelievable, I think, and I don’t really need to speak much on that,” Sophie Ecclestone who returned with figures of 4-0-14-1 said of Nat. “I think she’s one of the best players in the world and all-rounders in the world, and she’s so calm at the crease, she’s one of the most calm person, one of the nicest people. So, I think for her to keep scoring runs like she does for England is crucial for us to win this World Cup,” she said.
While the conditions still seemed ideal for India to chase the target, they once again lost Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues and Harmanpreet Kaur by the 11th over with just 62 runs on board. Although Smriti Mandhana and Richa Ghosh played their role to perfection, India were always behind the eight ball and it showed in the end as they fell short by 11 runs.
Peak of her powers

Born to an English diplomat (her mother) in Tokyo, Nat was raised in the Netherlands, where football and tennis were her first love. Cricket, understandably, was nowhere in the picture. Nat briefly played women’s league football in Poland as well. She took to cricket only when she went to college in Surrey before studying sports science from Loughborough University.
At 30, Nat is at the peak of her powers. With a wealth of experience to bank on, she is used to bailing out her team from dire situations. And as they are chasing their first T20 World Cup title since 2009, they have their hopes pinned on Nat.
Having returned to the team only in December after taking a break from excessive cricket last September, England are again beginning to see the best of Nat, who had walked away from cricket following a heartbreaking loss in The Hundred.
A bit of context here: With her team, Trent Rockets needing 22 runs off the final four deliveries against Southern Brave, she hit three sixes before holding out in the deep. “I hit three sixes because there seemed no choice. Then, because I wasn’t in a great place, I suddenly didn’t have a plan because the scenario had changed. By that point in the Hundred, it sounds bad, but I didn’t really care if we won or lost. I’ve never been like that before. I am competitive. I have never stepped onto a pitch without giving complete effort, and desire to win. I just needed a break,” she told The Daily Telegraph.

What would also hurt India is how England’s spinners outbowled them.

Aston Villa boss Unai emery rebukes keeper Emiliano Martinez for leaving goal empty,Emery saw his side give away the lead twice at Villa Park for the score to stand at 2-2 in added time after 90 minutes.,"Aston Villa manager Unai Emery chided his World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez for allowing Arsenal an easy fourth goal in their Premier League game on Saturday after the Argentina goalkeeper left his net to help seek a last-ditch equaliser.
Emery saw his side give away the lead twice at Villa Park for the score to stand at 2-2 in added time after 90 minutes.
Then, in an extraordinary finale, first Martinez scored an unfortunate own goal after the ball bounced off his head via the crossbar from a Jorginho shot – drawing joyful mockery from fans of Arsenal, his former club.
Then he joined team mates up front in the dying seconds, leaving his goal open for Arsenal to break and bag their fourth from Gabriel Martinelli into an empty net for a 4-2 win.
“I’ve never told my goalkeeper to go to score one goal in the 92nd minute,” said Spaniard Emery.
“Because maybe, I don’t know the data, maybe you score 1 goal in 100. And maybe 20 times they do the transition and they score goals 10 times. And today it happened. We can lose 2-3, but 2-4 it’s not good.”
The flamboyant and ever-controversial Martinez gained notoriety at the Qatar World Cup for his penalty antics to distract opponents, his mockery of France’s Kylian Mbappe, and a lewd gesture with his Golden Glove award.
He looked crestfallen at the final whistle on Saturday.
TURNING POINT

Jorginho, whose late strike off the bar was the game’s main turning and talking point, was euphoric.
“That’s the Premier League. That’s why it’s the best league in the world. It’s just beautiful,” he said.
Oleksandr Zinchenko, who scored his first goal for Arsenal to draw them level at 2-2, said the Premier League title ambition was back on for his talented team mates.
“This group are such amazing people. They can achieve everything they want if we continue this way, if we keep fighting, keep believing. The reaction from all of us in the second half was perfect,” he said.
Arteta was delighted with the comeback.

“If you want to be at the top, you are going to have to win games in many different ways,” he said.
“Credit to the boys. The dressing room was absolutely bouncing. It was a big effort to play less than 72 hours ago after the (Manchester City) game that we had, and after the result that we had which obviously morally was touching.”
Villa striker Ollie Watkins, who saw his early brilliant breakaway goal count for nothing, was disappointed the hosts could not hold out in the dying moments.
“Two all with four, five minutes to go, we should see the game out and draw at the end of the day,” he said.

The result put the Gunners back on top with 54 points after 23 games, three points above Manchester City who go to Nottingham Forest later on Saturday for their 24th match.
At a packed and raucous Villa Park in the Midlands, Ollie Watkins fired home the hosts’ opener – and his fourth goal in as many games – in the fifth minute after a scintillating run into the box and jink past defender William Saliba.

Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos confirms bid to buy Manchester United,"Ratcliffe's Ineos company will compete with Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani, who also submitted a bid on Friday to buy out the Glazer family.","British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe’s company Ineos confirmed Saturday it has made a bid to buy Manchester United, pledging to make the Premier League team “the number one club in the world once again”.
Ratcliffe’s Ineos company will compete with Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani, who also submitted a bid on Friday to buy out the Glazer family.
The 70-year-old Ratcliffe is one of Britain’s wealthiest people with an estimated net worth of 12.5 billion pounds ($15 billion) following the success of his global chemical company.
“We can confirm that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos have submitted a bid for majority ownership of Manchester United Football Club,” the company said in a statement. “We are ambitious and highly competitive and would want to invest in Manchester United to make them the number one club in the world once again.” Ineos also appeared to cast itself as an alternative to foreign ownership, with the Qatari bid coming in the wake of a Saudi takeover of Newcastle last year. Defending league champion Manchester City — United’s crosstown rival — has been Abu Dhabi-owned since 2008. Sheikh Jassim’s bid has emphasized that only private wealth is being used, in contrast to the Qatari state-backed ownership of Paris Saint-Germain.
“We also recognize that football governance in this country is at a crossroads,” Ineos said. “We would want to help lead this next chapter, deepening the culture of English football by making the club a beacon for a modern, progressive, fan-centred approach to ownership. We want a Manchester United anchored in its proud history and roots in the North-West of England, putting the Manchester back into Manchester United and clearly focusing on winning the Champions League.”
Ratcliffe announced his intention to bid last month. That was a shift in strategy from last year when he launched a last-minute bid for Chelsea, but was not considered because he missed the deadline.
Ratcliffe, who already owns French club Nice, last year said he had no interest in another bid for a Premier League club after missing out on Chelsea and receiving little encouragement from the Glazers for United.

IND vs AUS: Has David Warner played his last Test in India?,IND vs AUS: Michael Hussey says Warner “doesn’t look himself at the moment” and Allan Border reckons “footwork has been stagnant”.,"IND vs AUS: David Warner has perhaps played his last Test in India. He copped a few blows from bouncers from Mohammad Siraj and failed the resultant concussion test in the dressing room. Mathew Renshaw was named his concussion sub for the rest of the Test.
But it has emerged that Warner has also suffered a hair-line fracture in his elbow from one of the Siraj bouncers on the opening day’s play. “He got a knock to the arm and then the head, I think the head made him a little bit weary at the moment and couldn’t come out to field,” Australian teammate Usman Khawaja had said at the end of first day’s play.
“He just doesn’t look himself at the moment, David Warner,” former Australian batter Michael Hussey told Fox Sports. “He looked tentative … He’s just very late on that ball, not looking for the short ball at all.”
Allan Border too had his say on the matter. “The footwork was stagnant, wasn’t it. Very un-Warner-like, to get into these sorts of positions at the crease. He really had his struggles.”
“Warner was struck on the helmet by fast bowler Mohammed Siraj in the tenth over of play,” Cricket Australia said in a statement. “He subsequently demonstrated symptoms and failed a concussion test.
“Warner will now follow the graduated return to sport protocols ahead of the third Test in Indore in line with Cricket Australia guidelines.”
Border hoped that Renshaw, who was dropped for this game, grabs this chance.
“It’s a good opportunity for Renshaw, just out of the blue,” Border said. “It might be a bit like Marnus Labuschagne with (Steve) Smith in England – comes in and takes the chance. Hopefully that’s what happens.”

At the end of the first Test, former Australian captain Mark Taylor had given Warner 1 out of 10 marks.
“Davey in India … it’s not his favourite place to play. That’s an understatement. He’s averaging 22 in India, where he doesn’t have bounce or pace on the ball. He hasn’t had that in the past in India and he’s not going to get it at all in this series, but he’s going to have to find a way to conquer batting in India if he stays in the side.

The 34-year-old cricketer will now play a Marsh Sheffield Shied match for Victoria against South Australia on Monday, and if he does well he could be in line for national call-up for the three ODIs against India in March.
Maxwell had fractured his left fibula at a friend’s party days after Australia had made a premature exit from the ICC T20 World Cup at home in November 2022, following which he underwent surgery and a long three-month rest and recovery phase.
Maxwell’s injury had happened at a time when he was bracing for a Shield match in December last year to claim a spot in Australia’s Test squad for the ongoing Border-Gavaskar series in India.
Playing his first game after injury, Maxwell smashed 61, studded with two sixes and five boundaries for club side Fitzroy-Doncaster.
Maxwell, who has signed up to play for Birmingham Bears in England’s T20 Blast and London Spirit in The Hundred, showed that his recovery from injury is complete as he played some cracking shots during his 92-ball stay in a Victorian Premier Cricket fixture.
Coming in at 3/18, with his side struggling in the chase of Kingston Hawthorn’s 215 in Melbourne, Maxwell stabilised the innings and put them on course for a thrilling two-wicket win.

IND vs AUS: ‘Axar and Ashwin not lower-order batsmen; could bat in top six for most teams’ Nathan Lyon reaps praise,"‘We kept it simple. We just used our bowling brains,’ says Axar Patel about how they tackled Australia’s Lyon","IND vs AUS: After India’s lower-order blunted Australia for the second time in as many games, Nathan Lyon admitted in the press conference that they should no longer be termed lower-order batsmen. “I would rather say that India’s top order is long. Both Axar and Ashwin could bat in the top six for most teams, I can vouch for that. They should not be called lower-order batsmen,” he says.
The stats would concur: Ravi Ashwin has five hundreds in Tests; Axar Patel has reeled out three half centuries in 15 innings, averaging 31.30. Both, in combination with Ravindra Jadeja, have formed a robust lower-order, or rather as Lyon would say, an extended top order.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-2nd-test-axar-and-ashwin-nathan-lyon-8453013/,sports
IND vs AUS: Axar and Ashwin rescue India but Australia hold the advantage at Delhi Test,"Aggressive Australia leave India nervous at stumps but without Axar and Ashwin, the game would have already been beyond the hosts.","A ripple of applause sliced through the awkward silence of semi-filled Kotla stands, half an hour before tea. Until then, the Saturday crowd was downcast, after they watched in shock the unravelling of India’s batsmen, unable yet to recover from the perceived injustice the boy of the city, Virat Kohli, was made to endure.
Just then Axar Patel cut Pat Cummins for a boundary, a shot that sounded like the crack of a rifle, filling spontaneous hope and joy in the among spectators.There was so much to appreciate about that stroke, from the blend of power and timing to how he rose with the ball and wrapped his wrists over it, how he arched his lithe frame to generate the power and the wrist-snap for the perfect placement. The ferocity could have evoked appreciative glances from some of the Caribbean cut-masters of the past.

Those who stayed back were treated to a sumptuous display of batting. Axar would breeze away, soon joined by his partner Ravichandran Ashwin. Together, they stitched 114 runs to drag India from an abyss of 139/7 to a more breathe-easy 253/8. Axar too departed shortly—both wickets needing supremely athletic efforts and not an error in judgement from the batsmen. Eventually, India whittled down the deficit to merely a run, setting the stage for an engrossing third day, with Australia rampaging to 61 for 1 at stumps.
But if not for Axar and another lower-order fightback—-the last three adding 123 runs—the match would have been beyond the home-side. The top order had combusted and Virat Kohli, who had looked as assured he has been against spin in memory, fell to a controversial decision: he had pressed forward in defence, and one couldn’t tell if it was bat-first or pad-first but the third umpire would say “that’s pad first” and proceed to give him out. Things were dire at that stage but Axar stepped up.

There is so much to admire about Axar’s batting; he bats without fuss, without making batting on a turner, wading through a crisis, look like an ordeal. True that the older the ball got, the easier the pitch became for batting, but the pressure around him was immense.
That Cummins brought himself back into the attack was because he, and Ravi Ashwin, were nullifying the variegated threats Nathan Lyon and Co posed and defanging the largely imagined fangs of the surface. Lyon would pull out his whole bag of tricks. He began targeting the rough outside the off-stump. But Axar would stretch forward and meet the ball on the full, just under his eyes.
A tall man, he is blessed with reach, but he does not reach out to the ball with his hands alone like many tall batsmen tend to, but gets the body and legs to move in sync with his bat. Lyon would pull the length back, he would go back and defend or when it’s shorter cut. It’s the clarity and judgement that several of his top-order peers lacked in a mad spell of implosion before lunch.
His duels with Lyon were fascinating as well as instructive of his batting aptitude. Neither Lyon’s ghost appeals or constant sparrow-like chatter from close-in fielders affected the iron-will of Axar and Ashwin. Coincidentally, both began as batsmen before switching onto spin bowling in their teenage years. “They are not bowlers who can bat a bit, they can walk into the top 6 of most international teams,” Lyon would offer his respect at the end. Ashwin used to open batting for his club and state in his U-19 days, while Axar rose to fame in the tennis ball circuit of Nadiad for his big-hitting prowess.

Axar’s slog-sweep is a classic product of tennis-ball cricket. After judging the length, he bends on one knee and just swings the ball across the line. It might not be a classical stroke, but effective on subcontinental turners, without much bounce. Smartly, he doesn’t go too square with that shot either.
Strokes of more classical tone flew from his bat, like a gorgeous cover drive off Cummins, where he just extended his bat and coaxed the ball. In a rare show of despair, the Australian captain kicked the turf in anger. More agony followed as he stood tall and nailed a cut that screeched to the ropes. Cummins stared into the skies, he could see the shifting clouds and the drifting fortunes of the game. As sumptuous was his cover-driving, on a pitch where most batsmen struggled to drive, he kept driving them. On a pitch where batsmen found more runs behind square, most of his runs came in front of the wicket (55 off his 74 runs).

At the other end was Ashwin, who was largely performing the support-cast role before he decided to encash the panic and tedium that had crept into the mind and body of their adversaries. He would shuffle across and deflect Lyon for runs behind the wicket, gradually guiding India towards the vicinity of Australia’s first-innings total.
Each stroke of theirs felt like a stab on Australia’s heart. You could sense a wave of desperation lash them. Even Lyon began to err, straying on the leg, and giving width on the off-side for Axar cut. To cut, he would go deep into the crease, back away, expose stumps, and twirl his wrists to whisk the ball behind point. Though visually risky, he seldom misses the ball. A few times, the ball shot along the ground, the grubber, but his reflexes were sharp enough to still dig the ball towards safety. It’s how Jadeja cuts too, and there is so much in common with them, though their batting aren’t identical. Both have long front-foot strides, perhaps the longest in the team, both use the wrists effectively to defend the spinners, or work them for singles. Before Axar began to summon big strokes, he dealt mostly in nudges and deflections.

"IND vs AUS 2nd Test: Not the pitch, not Nathan Lyon but Indian top order have to blame themselves for their dismissals","IND vs AUS: The balls didn't keep low or bounce alarmingly or even turn diabolically. Lyon's series of stock offbreaks were enough for Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Cheteshwar Pujara to self combust","The pitch can’t be blamed for India losing their top three batsmen in the first session. Rohit Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara and KL Rahul also didn’t fall to unplayable balls. The reason for their early departure to the hut was their failure to read off-spinner Nathan Lyon’s stock ball that spun just that wee bit from round-the-wicket.
The pitch was dry, it wasn’t crumbling. The balls were keeping low but not shooting straight at the base of stumps after pitching. There was no alarming amount of bounce too. Even Lyon had kept it simple. He didn’t bowl a puzzling combination of variation to them, there was no elaborate web of deceit. Actually, he didn’t even change his angle. The top three wickets on Saturday fell because of the Indian batsmen’s inability to deal with a moderate amount of spin on a pitch that wasn’t quite diabolical.

"‘KL Rahul is scared of getting out, he is just restricting himself’: Experts slam India opener after another failure","According to Gavaskar, Rahul has a mental block and doesn't know whether to go forward or back.","KL Rahul poor run of form continued as he was dismissed for 17 by Australian spinner Nathan Lyon on day two of the second Test on Saturday.
Rahul (17), who survived two DRS appeals by Australia, was trapped leg-before as Lyon tossed one from round the wicket and got it to deviate enough and find his pads.
Rahul’s saga of failures led to questions from former greats including Sunil Gavaskar and Mark Waugh. According to Gavaskar, Rahul has a mental block and doesn’t know whether to go forward or back.
“He doesn’t know whether to go back or come forward. With KL Rahul, he takes his front foot across and the ball is turning into you, you have to play with a straight bat but when you take your front foot across like that you are left with no choice but to play with an angled bat,” Gavaskar said on Star Sports.
“The chances of you missing the ball are more. Rohit takes the front foot away, so he allows the bat to come around and play the ball in front of the pad. That’s why you see Rohit Sharma look so secure and why Rahul looks tentative,” Gavaskar added.
On the other hand, Australia opener Mark Waugh believed Rahul has a constant fear of getting out which restricts him from playing naturally.”I think KL Rahul has just to back himself a little bit. He is scared of getting out. You cannot bat that way, you’ve got to be confident in your own ability. He is just restricting himself. I’d love to see him bat freely and not worry about getting out,” Waugh said.
Meanwhile, former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar shared his thought on Rahul’s dismissal and said, “By aggression, I don’t mean he defends three balls and looks to hit a six in the fourth. I want him to be able to bat freely like Virat Kohli starts looking from ones and twos from ball one. That’s the way you become successful. You have to be proactive. When you are worried about getting out, your natural instincts get shackled.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kl-rahul-is-scared-of-getting-out-ind-vs-aus-2nd-test-8452924/,sports
"Broad and Bazball roll over the Kiwis on day 3, 1st test","Rapid half centuries by Joe Root, Harry Brook and Ben Foakes allowed England to speed along at more than five runs per over to 374 in its second innings, an overall lead of 393.","Stuart Broad and Bazball rolled over New Zealand on the third day of the first day-night cricket test Saturday, leaving England five wickets from its 10th win in 11 test matches.
Rapid half centuries by Joe Root, Harry Brook and Ben Foakes allowed England to speed along at more than five runs per over to 374 in its second innings, an overall lead of 393.
Stuart Broad then clean bowled Devon Conway (12), Kane Williamson (0), Tom Latham (15) and first innings century-maker Tom Blundell (1) to take out the batters who might have been able to anchor New Zealand’s highest successful fourth-innings run chase in tests and the sixth highest of all time.
When Blundell was out New Zealand was 28-5 and it had improved a little by stumps when it was 63-5, still 330 behind. Daryl Mitchell, who was 13, and Michael Bracewell, who was 25, saw out the last 10 overs of the day.
Broad’s four wickets lifted his tally of test wickets in partnership with James Anderson to 1,004, surpassing the Australian combination of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne (1,001), who previously were the most prolific wicket-taking pair in tests.
“I feel very blessed that I was born in the same era as (Anderson) so that I could bowl at the other end to him,” Broad said. “I felt like it was the perfect dryness of pitch today for my kind of bowling. I could slam the ball into the pitch but it was still skidding and hitting the stumps.” On a day seething with action, Root, Brook and Foakes carried England along at one-day international pace.
Root made 57 from 62 balls, Brook 54 from 41, Foakes 51 from 80 and there were also important contributions from Ollie Pope (49 from 46), Ben Stokes (31 from 33) and Ollie Robinson (39 from 48) which showed why the innings progressed at such irresistible pace.
ADVERTISEMENT
At times it was impossible to look without missing an important piece of the action, so densely packed were the highlights.
The fearlessness which has become the heart of England’s approach was always on show. When batting, England shows no deference to the time of day, the state of the match or the efforts of the bowling team. The object always was to dominate.
When England bowled, as Broad again demonstrated under the floodlights which caused the ball to swing, there was an effort to make every ball a wicket ball. He brought the ball back at pace and late to both the left- and right-handers.
New Zealand simply couldn’t stand the force of the Bazball doctrine. It had done well on the second day with the help of Blundell’s century to come within 19 runs of England’s first innings of 325-9 declared, the declaration having come midway through the last session on the first day.
ADVERTISEMENT
England already had begun to remove the props of New Zealand’s confidence when it reached 79-2 before stumps on Day 2. And when Pope, Root and Brook helped England score 158 runs in the first session on Saturday, it was clear the match rapidly was escaping New Zealand.
Any hopes New Zealand might have had of battling through the final session to launch its run chase in full on the fourth day began to fade when Broad swung the ball back through Conway’s usually solid defense to claim his valuable wicket in the fourth over.

IND vs AUS: ‘We changed the way we bowled’ Kasprowicz looks back at Australia’s last Test triumph in India,"With India recording a massive win in the series opener in Nagpur, Australia will have to pull off something miraculous to beat the mighty hosts in their own backyard.","Michael Kasprowicz, an important member of Australia’s last Test triumph in India close to 19 years ago, fondly looks back at the past as the current squad finds itself under the pump again in spin-friendly conditions.
With India recording a massive win in the series opener in Nagpur, Australia will have to pull off something miraculous to beat the mighty hosts in their own backyard.
Kasprowicz, who supported Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie with nine wickets in the 2-1 series win in 2004, fails to understand the non-stop talk about the pitches by the travelling Australian media.
He feels the nature of the pitches has not changed at all and it was because of their tactics that they were able to conquer the final frontier close to two decades ago.
“Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie were obviously (the stand out bowlers). I was fortunate enough to be included in the side having had experience of playing in India in the 1998 and 2001 unsuccessful series,” the 51-year-old, who is here as a commentator, told PTI.
“We changed the way we bowled (on previous tours). We bowled a lot straighter. We used the bouncer with strategic field positions like a catching midwicket or two men for the hook shot.
“Essentially it was bowling to India’s strengths but with the field placement and execution, that worked in our favour. That was the benefit of doing something a lot different compared to (earlier tours),” he recollected.
ADVERTISEMENT
Fast forward to 2023, Australia, whose traditional strength has been fast bowling, are playing three specialist spinners in the second Test with skipper Pat Cummins the only fast bowling option.
The unusual selection has also been forced upon due to injuries to Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Cameron Green.
“The current side’s strength also has been three fast bowlers but because of injuries to Starc and Hazlewood, they have had to change the team combination to maintain balance of the team.
“Coming here after seeing Nagpur, they have come here backing the spin bowlers. That is why we have got two spinners getting baggy greens in the last two Tests,” said Kasprowicz referring to rookie spinners Todd Murphy and Matthew Kunhemann.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Adam Gilchrist-led side had sealed the series in 2004 with an emphatic 342-run in Nagpur, where a pace-friendly track was laid out for the Australian pace trio of McGrath, Gillespie and Kasprowicz himself.
Kasprowicz was quick to butt in at the mention of a green top in Nagpur.
“I won’t say wickets have changed a lot and I would not say Nagpur was a green top. It was a little better than the usual with more grass covering. The surface possibly had a bit more bounce.
“Having said that, pitches have not changed. It is the same. I don’t know if it has become fashionable to talk about wickets in the lead up to the series here.” From the next series onwards, India and Australia will battle it out over five Tests. Over the last decade or so, rivalry between the two teams has only got more intense with India getting the better of Aussies on their previous two tours Down Under.
Kasprowicz thinks the rivalry has become even bigger than the Ashes and rightfully so.
ADVERTISEMENT
“When we came in 1998, we hadn’t been here for a number of years. Then you had the 2001 series (which India won). For a longer period of time India was the destination and it was seen as a massive challenge. From the BCCI’s point of view they are really keen on turning this series into a marquee one.

Zimbabwe ban fan after attempt to involve player in match fixing,"Edward Walter Mupangano, a 27-year-old from Harare, was banned by Zimbabwe Cricket after approaching Luke Jongwe last August and sought to introduce him to an Indian bookmaker.","A cricket supporter has received a five-year ban after he unsuccessfully tried to get a Zimbabwe international player involved in a spot-fixing deal, Zimbabwe Cricket announced on Saturday as it called for such offences to be criminalised.
Edward Walter Mupangano, a 27-year-old from Harare, was banned by Zimbabwe Cricket after approaching Luke Jongwe last August and sought to introduce him to an Indian bookmaker.
The book maker allegedly wanted the player to bowl in a pre-arranged manner during an international match in return for a payment amounting to $7,000, a statement said.
“The facilitator himself would allegedly receive $3,000 if the planned corrupt activity was successful. Jongwe immediately reported the approach,” it added.
Following an investigation, Mupangano accepted a charge of violating Zimbabwe Cricket’s Anti-Corruption Code and was banned for five years from all ZC-affiliated cricket venues and events.
“ZC believes cases such as this demonstrate the urgent need for Zimbabwe to have a legal instrument to make fixing and any other sporting corruption a criminal offence.
“It is our view that harsh sanctions, including custodial sentences, will go a long way in helping cricket to curb one of the biggest threats to its credibility,” Zimbabwe Cricket Chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani said.

"After tampon row, Michael Johnson takes dig at Tiger Woods, says ‘he has never been a leader’ and ‘has learned nothing’","4-time Olympic gold medallist Johnson says Woods is still heralded after all his mistakes and media focus is always on his recovery, not why the need for recovery","Legendary American sprinter Michael Johnson has blasted golf superstar Tiger Woods after the latter discreetly handed Justin Thomas a tampon after outdriving his playing partner at the Genesis Invitational on Friday.
The incident on day one drew criticism on social media, with many stating it was disrespectful to women. Woods apologised for the incident.
“It was supposed to be all fun and games and obviously it hasn’t turned out that way,” said Woods, 47.
“If I offended anybody in any way, shape or form, I’m sorry,” he added.
“It was not intended to be that way. We play pranks on one another all the time and virally I think this did not come across that way, but between us it was, it’s different.”
However four-time Olympic gold medallist Johnson saw right through the apology, saying that Woods is still heralded after all his mistakes and that media focus is always on his recovery, not why the need for recovery.
Johnson tweeted: “Apology starting with “If I offended anyone” is no apology. But this is Tiger. Never been a leader and he’s Teflon. Still heralded after all the mistakes so he’s learned nothing. Media focus always on miraculous recovery. Never why the need for recovery.”

Woods is playing in his first competitive PGA Tour event since missing the cut at The Open in July. The 15-time major champion was in a group with PGA Championship winner Thomas and four-time major winner Rory McIlroy for the first two rounds.

It’s not the first time that Woods and Thomas have been involved in controversial incidents in their careers.
Woods was involved in a car crash in November 2009 which eventually led to admissions of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage. He then took a break from golf but returned shortly afterward.

FIA clarifies ban on drivers making political statements,"The guidance noted drivers “can express their views on any political, religious or personal matter before, during and after” the race “in their own space, and outside the scope of the international competition.”","The governing body for Formula One issued guidance a rule recently introduced that prohibited drivers from speaking out on political and controversial issues.
The FIA’s original rule barred “political, religious and personal statements” without prior consent, and expressed no limitations on where that restriction applied. Drivers were nearly unanimous in their criticism of the ruling and seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton said he would not follow the ban.
The guidance issued Friday puts limits on when the FIA can apply the rules — and the restrictions will be upheld during pre- and post-race events and on the track.
The guidance noted drivers “can express their views on any political, religious or personal matter before, during and after” the race “in their own space, and outside the scope of the international competition.”
The FIA will permit the freedom of speech “through their own social media, during interviews with accredited media and during the FIA press conference, only in response to direct questions from journalists.” The FIA will allow “exceptional” circumstances in which it could grant a driver the ability to make a political statement “at an international competition that would otherwise be prohibited” if that request is submitted to the governing body four weeks in advance of an event.
The driver must “provide reason(s) why such permission should be granted.” The FIA noted “the updates cement the FIA’s longstanding commitment to protecting motor sport’s neutrality, and will particularly ensure neutrality during key moments across all motor sport competitions, such as podiums, national anthems and official activities on the field of play’ – it does not impose any additional restrictions on individuals expressing their views outside of these times.
“It was necessary to provide a separate guidance document to facilitate the implementation of the principles of neutrality across the many different motor sport disciplines.” Hamilton this week said “nothing will stop me from speaking on the things that I am passionate about and the issues that there are.

“I feel the sport does have a responsibility to speak out on things and raise awareness on certain topics, particularly as we travel to all these places, so nothing changes for me,” he added.

Lee Mason leaves referees’ body after VAR error in Arsenal game,"Mason, a Premier League referee for 15 years, oversaw 287 top-flight matches during that time, with his last coming in the closing stages of the 2021-22 season. ","Lee Mason has left the referees’ body PGMOL by mutual agreement after making a mistake as the Video Assistant Referee in last weekend’s 1-1 Premier League draw between Arsenal and Brentford, Professional Game Match Officials Limited said on Friday.
Ivan Toney’s equaliser for Brentford saw then-league leaders Arsenal drop two points in the title race but replays showed the goal should have been ruled out for offside in the build-up.
PGMOL said later on Sunday that the decisions which went against both Arsenal and also Brighton & Hove Albion in Saturday’s league matches were down to “human error”.
“PGMOL can confirm that Video Assistant Referee Lee Mason has departed the organisation by mutual consent,” the referees body said in a statement on Friday.
Mason, a Premier League referee for 15 years, oversaw 287 top-flight matches during that time, with his last coming in the closing stages of the 2021-22 season.
“His full career in the professional game saw the 51-year-old officiate in over 500 fixtures after he progressed to the Football League in 1998,” PGMOL said.
Brighton saw their bid for European football hit a speed bump at Crystal Palace when they were held to a 1-1 draw but Pervis Estupinan’s effort was wrongly chalked off for offside.

"Aditi Ashok maintains brilliant run, leads world No. 1 Lydia Ko by two shots","Aditi, who in the last two weeks had won in Kenya and finished third in Morocco, is leading a star-studded field at the USD 5 million event on the Ladies European Tour.","India’s Aditi Ashok continued her brilliant run as she added a 6-under 66 in the second round to move to 13-under and a two-shot lead over world No. 1 Lydia Ko in the Aramco Saudi Ladies International here on Friday.
Aditi, who in the last two weeks had won in Kenya and finished third in Morocco, is leading a star-studded field at the USD 5 million event on the Ladies European Tour.
Starting on the tenth tee, Aditi was in excellent form as she found five birdies and an eagle on the back nine of the Royal Green Golf Club to score 7-under 29 on the stretch.
Getting to the front nine, Aditi, who was bogey free on the first day, bogeyed the first and sixth and was on 12-under when she holed a final birdie to move to 13-under and two clear of Lydia, who had earlier finished the day at 3-under 69 to get to 12-under and be tied second with American Lilia Vu (66).
Aditi, a four-time LET winner, who ended a long winless streak two weeks ago in Kenya, divides her time between Ladies European Tour and LPGA. She has begun the 2023 season with three events on the LET and already has a win and third place in those starts.
Focusing on a strong off-season preparation, she has been reaping rich rewards for her work. She used the two months between the two seasons to work and practice.
Aditi said, “I think two months off and practicing a lot compared to how much I would’ve practiced if I was in season has helped with the start to the year.

Asia Mixed Team Championships: India enter maiden semifinals after overturning a 0-2 deficit against Hong Kong,"Dhruv Kapila-Chirag Shetty, PV Sindhu and Treesa Jolly-Gayatri Gopichand win their respective ties against Hong Kong to set up a semifinal clash with China.","When DK Sen representing the Indian contingent at the draw ceremony picked out Hong Kong China as the team’s quarterfinal opponents, it was considered fortuitous. Hong Kong had come through the qualifiers and have been in semis of the Badminton Asia Mixed Team Championships before, but don’t boast of big names on the Tour. What panned out on the courts though was one giant roller-coaster team tie, as India punched back from 0-2 down to finally win 3-2, with two of those wins coming from doubles – a sign of progress in the sport. In the semifinals, Indian team will play China, which has travelled with a development squad. A bronze medal is assured after India made their first foray into Last-4 of the championships.
It needed Chirag Shetty’s experience and composure to believe they could do it despite going 0-2 down, after the mixed doubles of Ishaan Bhatnagar and Tanisha Crasto and the singles match of Lakshya Sen saw opponents get stuck into them in the first two rubbers.

A couple of overs later, the 36-year-old was struck again by Siraj’s deliveries a couple of time on his helmet.
His time in the middle would end shortly as he edged Mohammed Shami behind for keeper Srikar Bharat to lap up the opportunity comfortably. Warner departed for just 15 runs, his highest score in the series till date.

“I have to kind of disagree with what you’re saying. He hit two fours of Ashwin in the last game before he got out lbw so he was showing some aggression,” Khawaja said, when asked if Warner, whose stay looked painstaking during the 44 deliveries faced, needs to be pro-active.
“It’s never easy out there, especially starting out, even if you’re opening starting out there is never easy so I was lucky today. I got a couple (of boundaries) to get me going.
“Sometimes you don’t get that and it can be very hard. So yeah, three innings is not enough for me. There’s still a long way to go in this Test series. I’m looking forward to what may happen.” Khawaja is very confident of Warner’s capabilities of bouncing back.
“Davey has been such a terrific player for such a long time. Every time his back is against the wall he produces something so we’ll see.” Warner might have suffered mild concussion

Khawaja said that the hit on the head has made Warner a bit tizzy and hence he didn’t come out to take the field.
“I think the medical staff will have to assess tomorrow. He is a little bit weary at the moment. He obviously got a knock to the arm and then to the head and the head has made him a little bit weary and hence why he didn’t come out to field.
“I think the medical staff will have to figure out what happens from here on in,” Khawaja informed.
“263 is a good score, don’t know about par”
One might beg to differ but the opener feels that 263 is a good score on this track.

“I don’t know a par score until India bats on it. I feel like 260 is pretty good but we are going to have to wait and see tomorrow what India gets,” Khawaja said.
He is hopeful that Nathan Lyon, Todd Murphy and Matt Kuhnemann will exploit the conditions to the fullest.
“They’re very good in their own conditions. I think now we have three spinners in the team, especially on that wicket, is going to be challenging, just like their spinners were very challenging.” Shami hit the cracks well
Khawaja pointed out that the surface has an “up and down” feel to it and some of the cracks in the middle of the 22-yard strip aren’t stable enough.

“There are cracks running through the surface. The cracks are not stable. They are hitting those cracks. On top of that, Shami and Siraj are very good bowlers. You expect them to get something with the new ball. And when it is reversing, they are also very good.” “Played by feel”
Khawaja faced a total of seven balls across two innings in Nagpur and hence didn’t do anything different in Delhi.
“I didn’t get a chance to play the first game. I only faced seven balls for the game. So there was no real difference in the plans. I just play by feel. I play by what I think is right for the wicket when I go out. I don’t go out there thinking I want to play certain way.
“I just feel how the bowlers are trying to bowl to me and then I read the game from there. So it’s as simple as that. There’s no difference. And that’s pretty much what I did today,” Khawaja explained his mindset.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/usman-khawaja-on-david-warners-form-ind-vs-aus-border-gavaskar-trophy-8451767/,sports
IND vs AUS: Khawaja mere Khawaja rings around Kotla,IND vs AUS: Opener's fluent 81 headlines Day 1 as Australia puts up a fight against India in Delhi,"IND vs AUS: The five-minute drinks break in the second session was sombre. The loud Kotla crowd was suffocatingly quiet. Beside the pitch, the Indian players stood scattered, gulping energy drinks and water; a few metres away, Usman Khawaja and Peter Handscomb stumbled on the ground in a satisfied world after quelling Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.
It’s often the tone of the second session — meandering passages interlaced with standalone moments of magic. That moment of magic arrived in the fourth ball off the 45th over. Khawaja unfurled a reverse-sweep, a stroke that he executed adroitly throughout the innings. He sweet-spotted it as he had most strokes in the day, but KL Rahul, the condemned and ridiculed opener, leaped sideways like an alley cat to pluck a one-handed blinder. The catch was day-defining, in that it helped India restrict Australia to 263, when they looked destined for a meatier total. The crowd burst forth in joy; so did India’s cricketers under the Kotla sun that had begun its retreat into the horizon. Khawaja walked back shadow-reverse-sweeping, his head hung in dejection after his 125-ball 81 runs.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-australia-border-gavaskar-trophy-usman-khawaja-feroz-shah-kotla-8451745/,sports
"IND vs AUS 2nd Test Day 1: Shami, spinners restrict Australia to 263",The highlight on Friday was KL Rahul's brilliant catch at point off a powerful reverse sweep by Khawaja.,"Mohammed Shami’s clever variations with the semi-new and old ball were beautifully complemented by the spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin as India restricted Australia to 263 on the opening day of the second Test on Friday.
Opener Usman Khawaja (81, 125 balls) made amends for a horrendous first-Test outing at Nagpur with an attractive knock while Peter Handscomb (72 not out, 142 balls) played with determination at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday, but their efforts weren’t enough as the visitors were all out in 78.4 overs.
At stumps, India were 21 for no loss with Rohit Sharma (13 batting) and KL Rahul (4 batting) at the crease. Shami’s (14.4-4-60-4) repertoire of deliveries was on full display as he struck with the new, semi-new and old ball, while Ashwin (21-4-57-3) and Jadeja (21-2-68-3) came up with breakthroughs just when the opposition seemed to be gaining foothold as India took the opening day’s honours.
The highlight on Friday was KL Rahul’s brilliant catch at point off a powerful reverse sweep by Khawaja. That athletic effort not just broke the 59-run sixth-wicket partnership between Khawaja and Handscomb and also halted Australia’s charge.
The pitch was a typical slow turner but had better carry than the Nagpur wicket and and it did help Khawaja, as he was able to hit through the line during his knock that had 12 fours and a six.
Shami must be given credit for the way he bowled after Rohit Sharma pressed him from the other end in the first session.
Mohammed Siraj, despite going wicketless, deserves credit for softening up David Warner, who struggled during his 50-run stand with Khawaja. Two short balls — one hitting the Australian opener on the elbow and the other flush on the helmet — did unnerve the opener.

Shami then came wide off the crease and angled one into Warner. The line was immaculate with a fuller length and Warner could only jab at it.
Ashwin then came into the act as Australia, from a comfortable 94/1, lost Marnus Labuschagne (18) and Steve Smith (0) in the space of two deliveries.
Labuschagne got an off-break that turned quite a bit and found him plumb in front, while Smith edged one to Kona Bharat, whose amazing reflexes and good technique paid rich dividends.
In the post-lunch session, Shami bowled another probing spell getting the better of Travis Head, who came in for Matt Renshaw for the second Test. Shami came closer to the stumps and bowled one which wasn’t at a drivable length and Head’s thick outside edge flew to Rahul, who took a nice catch wide of second slip.
ADVERTISEMENT
Once Alex Carey was accounted for by Ashwin, Khawaja and Handscomb forged a nice partnership. The pitch wasn’t difficult to bat on and the duo comfortably negotiated the Indian spinners between lunch and tea.
In fact, Handscomb looked quite assured as he took wide front-foot strides to negate the slow turn and occasionally went on the back-foot to punch the spinners on the off side. He hit nine boundaries and, perhaps, played the best knock in three completed Australian innings in the series so far.
But Australia’s dream of a big stand lay shattered when Khawaja went for an ambitious reverse sweep off Jadeja and Rahul plucked a one-handed stunner out of thin air.
Skipper Pat Cummins (33) decided to play a counter-attacking game as Handscomb accumulated runs at the other end.
ADVERTISEMENT
At 227 for 6, it seemed that Australia would score 300-plus in the first essay, which would have been a decent total by any standards. But Jadeja got into action and increased the pace of his deliveries, gauging the slowness of the track.
The result was a couple of quick wickets of Cummins and Todd Murphy (0) before Shami used the good old reverse swing to clean up the tail.
Nathan Lyon was cleaned up by one that tailed in on the side of the shine while debutant Matt Kuhnemann had his leg stump pegged back.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-2nd-test-day-1-report-8451741/,sports

The Saurashtra vice-captain, whose 106 handed them a match-winning first innings lead in the 2020 final in Rajkot, once again got under the skin of Bengal, sharing two key partnerships with Sheldon Jackson (59) and Chirag Jani (57 not out).

Saurashtra were 317 for 5 at close on day two in reply to Bengal’s 174 all out.
Fresh from his match-winning double century against Karnataka in the semifinal, Vasavada continued from where he left off and stood tall in his unbeaten knock that came off 155 balls. He slammed 11 boundaries.
Jani also looked at ease hitting 10 boundaries as the duo dictated terms especially in the final session.
Their pace-heavy attack turning out to be a big letdown, Bengal took 46 minutes to get the first breakthrough in the morning session.
By then, overnight batter Harvik Desai (50) got to his 12th half-century in a dogged partnership with night-watchman Chetan Sakariya who saw off the first hour with resolute eight off 45 balls.

Mukesh Kumar and Ishan Porel dismissed Desai and Sakariya in addition of just eight runs but from thereon the left-handed Vasavada seized control with Jackson in a 95-run partnership that set the tone and took their score past Bengal’s 174.

But Jani came to pile on Bengal’s misery with his entertaining strokeplay in their century-plus stand that virtually sealed their second Ranji triumph.
Making full use of a reprieve on 26 when Shahbaz Ahmed dropped a sitter, Jani raced to his 13th first-class half-century in 72 balls.
After the play resumed post-tea break which was extended by 20 minutes because of bad light, Jani stepped on the gas as he drove, pulled and also straight-drove one with elegance.

The conditions on day two were hazy and gloomy at Eden Gardens and reflected in the home team’s camp as their pace-heavy attack failed to seize control in the first hour’s play.
Akash Deep erred in line and bowled mostly on fifth and sixth stump, while star pacer Mukesh was negated well by a resolute batting by the overnight duo of wicketkeeper-batter Desai and Sakariya.
Sakariya took some blows on his body but held firm to ward off the Bengal pace attack before the conditions eased up.
Unlike day one, the pitch looked brown and there was not much help for pacers, while Akash Deep looked a shadow of his past.

Desai was the first wicket to fall when he failed to read the line as a Mukesh Kumar delivery jagged back in to trap him in front.
Porel looked the pick of the attack and bowled a superb delivery to clip Sakariya’s off stump.
It was a time when Bengal could have made some more inroads with two new batters — Jackson and Vasavada — at crease.
But Akash Deep drifted the ball away to pads, giving freebies. Jackson and Vasavada both got off with elegant cover drives and there was no looking back.

Batting at No. 7, Blundell was 82 when New Zealand’s ninth wicket fell and he was joined at the crease by No. 11 Blair Tickner, a lanky, moustachioed fast bowler on test debut with a first class batting average of 10.
Summing up the situation, Blundell hit the accelerator and struck 6, 4 and 4 from the bowling of spinner Jack Leach to move to 96. As Blundell watched nervously, Tickner played out an over from Ollie Robinson before Blundell twice worked the ball for two off Leach to complete his fourth test century.

He was undaunted, even when England took the second new ball just as the floodlights kicked in at Bay Oval in the day-night match. Blundell went on to 138 before he was the last man out. Tickner played a brave debut innings of 3 from 24 balls and New Zealand finished at 306, just 19 runs behind England’s 325-9 declared.
“I came out in a difficult situation and it was nice to come out with Devon Conway,” Blundell said.
“I actually didn’t say too much to Tickner. He took it on himself and batted very nicely and did a great job.” As England batted again under lights, Tickner made a vital breakthrough, dismissing Ben Duckett for 25 to end his imposing first innings of 84 from 68 balls.
Blundell then caught Zac Crawley (28) off Scott Kuggeleijn and at stumps England was 79-2, leading by 98 runs with Ollie Pope 14 not out and Stuart Broad 6.
When play began on the second day, there seemed little chance of New Zealand coming close to England’s total: the home team had been 37-3 overnight after losing Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls and Kane Williamson in less than 90 minutes before stumps.

Devon Conway survived the pink ball trial under floodlights and was 17 not out at the end of day one. England likely saw his wicket Friday as the key to ensuring a solid first innings lead buy they reckoned without Blundell.
When England captain Ben Stokes, bowling with a heavily strapped left knee, bounced out Conway for 77 on Friday it seemed the pivotal moment of the second day.
For historians, the more momentous moment came when Stuart Broad dismissed nightwatchman Neil Wagner in the seventh over to capture the 1,000th wicket of his long-standing bowling partnership with James Anderson.
Broad, 36, and Anderson, 40, are playing their 133rd test in tandem since their first in 2008 and now are poised to overtake Australia’s Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne who took 1,001 wickets in 104 tests as the most prolific bowling pair in test history.

Stokes showed no signs of pain as he thumped the wearing pink ball into the middle of the pitch at the Bay Oval, testing the New Zealand batsmen with an array of short-pitched deliveries.
Conway endured for 229 minutes before he finally fell to Stokes when New Zealand was 158-6 and still 167 short of England’s total. He swatted at a head-high ball from Stokes and was caught at square leg.

Women’s T20 World Cup: India will need to up their game against England,"A win against world number two England on Friday will take the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side effectively into the knock-out stage, to be competed among top two teams from Group 1 and 2.","After being put under pressure in their previous two games, India will have no room for error when they take on a formidable England in the Women’s T20 World Cup here on Friday.
A win against world number two England on Friday will take the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side effectively into the knock-out stage, to be competed among top two teams from Group 1 and 2. The Indians beat arch-rivals Pakistan by seven wickets before notching a more convincing six-wicket win against West Indies earlier this week.
While the twin wins put India in a strong position to qualify for the semifinals, it was hard-hitting teenager Richa Ghosh’s brilliance which pulled the ‘Women in Blue’ over the line on both occasions.
Against England, the top-order will have to give a better account of themselves. U-19 World Cup-winning captain Shafali Verma has been unable to convert her starts in the tournament so far, giving away her wicket at crucial junctures. Back after nursing a finger injury, Smriti Mandhana looked in imperious touch as she timed the ball to perfection but couldn’t go the distance.

Jemimah Rodrigues will seek some consistency while skipper Kaur has also looked in good touch and has made useful contributions though she has not scored big so far with 33 being her highest. They will have to navigate England’s spin trio of Charlie Dean, Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn.
While the bowling department put up a much-improved show against West Indies, the Indian bowlers will have to bowl out of their skin against England, who have the likes teenager Alice Capsey, who will head into the match high on confidence after notching the joint-fastest fifty in Women’s T20 World Cup history.
Pooja Vastrakar has been impressive, sharing the new ball duties with Renuka Singh while the ever-reliable Deepti Sharma bowled showcased exemplary death bowling against West Indies.
The fielding too has been patchy, with mis-fields and dropped catch marring some stellar display. India can ill afford the sloppiness against England who are bound punish any mistakes.

On the other hand, firm title contenders England, like India, are also unbeaten after two games and are best-placed to qualify for the semifinals.
On the same points as India (+0.590), Heather Knight and Co. lead the group owing to a superior net run rate of +2.497.
The mix of youth and experience is doing the trick for the former champions with the likes of Capsey and Lauren Bell supporting the experience of Knight, Nat and Katherine Sciver-Brunt and Danni Wyatt.

Erik Ten Hag suggests Manchester United denied ‘clear penalty’ because referee succumbed to Barcelona stadium pressure,The furore was over Jules Kounde's challenge on Marcus Rashford when United were leading 2-1 in the Europa League tie.,"In a clash of European heavyweights, on a stage that humbled both teams, FC Barcelona and Manchester United played out a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Nou Camp in the first leg of their Round of 32 tie in the Europa League.
Despite plenty of action on the field, controversial refereeing decisions and VAR calls emerged as big talking points. When United were 2-1 up, Jules Kounde took down Marcus Rashford, which Red Devils manager Erik Ten Hag believes was a ‘clear foul’, near the edge of the box. United called for a penalty, but the referee and VAR both disagreed.
Ten Hag was furious, however, that it was not given as a red card and suggested it was the pressure of the atmosphere at the Nou Camp that influenced the referee. “It was 2-1, a clear foul on Marcus Rashford and a penalty. If it’s in the box or just outside the box, it’s definitely a red card,” he was quoted as saying by The Guardian.
“I asked the referee: why? He said it was outside the box and it was no foul. The referee and the linesman were in a good position and if not there is the VAR. It’s not good. It’s a really bad decision.”
“Maybe they were impressed by the pressure that Barcelona made but they can’t be at the highest level,” the Dutchman added.
Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez was equally furious over a possible penalty to the hosts, when the ball appeared to hit United midfielder Fred’s hand in the box. “It’s a penalty the size of a cathedral; how are you going to feel?” he said. “I don’t know what they have to do to blow a penalty for handball. They looked at it as well and said no. It seems incredible to me, incredible.”
Barcelona will now be travelling to Old Trafford for a high-stakes second leg next week with the ties even, and the elimination of the ‘away-goals rule’ last year diminishing any advantage United may have had.

Ten Hag will want his side to be more ruthless in front of goal if they are to get through. “In a game when you create five or seven chances you have to finish more,” he said after the game. “We need to be more clinical, finish our chances. In such a game we created many chances and there is a disappointment that we did not finish them.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/erik-ten-hag-suggests-manchester-united-denied-clear-penalty-because-referee-succumbed-to-barcelona-stadium-pressure/,sports

Glenn Maxwell set to return to action after long injury layoff,Maxwell fractured his left fibula at a friend's birthday party days after Australia made a premature exit from the ICC T20 World Cup at home in November.,"Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell could be priming himself for Sheffield Shield action after assessing his fitness during a weekend club cricket fixture on his return from a grievous leg injury suffered last year.
Maxwell fractured his left fibula at a friend’s birthday party days after Australia made a premature exit from the ICC T20 World Cup at home in November.
The 34-year-old white-ball specialist is set to play his first competitive match in more than than three months over the weekend, which could clear his path to playing for Victoria in the Marsh Sheffield Shield clash against South Australia next week.
When Maxwell got injured, he was bracing up for his maiden Shield match in three years to further his claim to be in the squad for the ongoing four-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India.
Maxwell will play for club side Fitzroy-Doncaster on Saturday, following which he will have a fitness test. If cleared, he will turn out in Monday’s Shield fixture against South Australia at Junction Oval.
“To bring a player of Glenn’s calibre into the squad is exciting, he has a fantastic record in Shield cricket and it’s a shame he hasn’t been able to play more of it,” Cricket Victoria’s head of male cricket, David Hussey was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.
Speculation is that Maxwell, who has signed up to play for Birmingham Bears in England’s T20 Blast and London Spirit in The Hundred, could still tour India for the three ODIs in March scheduled after the Test series.

Victoria coach Chris Rogers said Maxwell’s return would be great for his side.
“For us (Victoria), he wants to play, that’s the most important thing. He hasn’t played a lot of it (first-class cricket) and I know he loves it when he does play.

Australia go into Test with just one quick but Steve O’Keefe remains bullish the visitors can bounce back,"This is the first time in more than five years that Australia are playing three regular spinners, with the previous occasion being the 2017 Test against Bangladesh in Chattogram, where the visitors went in with three tweakers -- Lyon, Ashton Agar and O'Keefe.","Australia going into a Test match with just one pacer is a rarity but former spinner Steve O’Keefe is confident the Pat Cummins-led side has the capability to bounce back after the innings loss in Nagpur against India.
Australia lost the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar series by an innings and 132 runs on a turning track, which prompted Cummins to go with just one quick and three spinners — Nathan Lyon, Todd Murphy and debutant Matthew Kuhnemann — in the second Test at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday.
This is the first time in more than five years that Australia are playing three regular spinners, with the previous occasion being the 2017 Test against Bangladesh in Chattogram, where the visitors went in with three tweakers — Lyon, Ashton Agar and O’Keefe.
With pacers Cameron Green and Mitchell Starc not selected due to injury concerns and Josh Hazlewood succumbing to a left Achilles tendon issue, Cummins is the only quick who will do all the heavy lifting in the pace-bowling department.
Travis Head, who is back in the playing XI, and Marnus Labuschagne can also shoulder the bowling burden with their spin.
Despite criticism of the Australian side following the debacle, O’Keefe said he remains positive about his team’s chances in the four-Test series. “I still remain bullish on the series with this Australian side,” O’Keefe said on ‘SEN Radio’.
“In India, in their last 43 Tests at home, they’ve lost two. They are unstoppable, we’re talking about a country with 1.4 billion cricket lovers and they are experts in their own conditions.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It is hard… but I genuinely believe guys like (Steve) Smith, Labuschagne, Head, (Matthew) Renshaw, are guys who are capable enough to play spin.” While Renshaw failed to impress in Nagpur getting dismissed for 0 and 2, openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja too failed in both the innings, but O’Keefe felt the batters can bounce back.
“Usman Khawaja can do really well, we’re expecting David Warner with all his experience to stand up, and if the Aussies look back at that last game, there were fleeting moments where they had chances to grab the games.
“There was a couple of chances to turn that 170 into 270 and it’s a different game,” he said.
Australia were dismissed for 177 in the first innings of the Nagpur Test.

"India vs Australia playing XI tip-off: Shreyas Iyer to replace Suryakumar Yadav, KL Rahul to retain his spot","The training sessions in the buildup to the match have indicated that Iyer, coming from the injury is looking comfortable and is likely to make his way back in the XI for the Delhi Test.","Having won the first Test by a whooping 132-runs and an innings, India will start as firm favorites in the second of four Tests against Australia starting Friday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi.
However, the hosts might have to swim through a couple of selection questions ahead of the match.
Shreyas in for Surya
With Shreyas Iyer back in the Indian squad having missed out on the first Test owing to a lower back injury, the right hander looks set to walk back into the India XI ahead of Suryakumar Yadav, who made his Test debut in Nagpur.
Read | An ode to sparkling serenity of Rohit Sharma’s batting stillness
Iyer had sustained a lower back injury during the white-ball series against Sri Lanka last month and had to undergo a one-month rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) owing to which he also missed the first Test against Australia.
When asked about his fitness update, India head coach Rahul Dravid had said on Wednesday’s press conference, “Certainly, if he is ready to take the load of a five-day Test match, then without doubt, with his performances in the past, he will walk straight into the side.”
The training sessions in the buildup to the match have indicated towards the middle order batter looking comfortable and in shape to make his way back in the XI for the second Test.
Rahul to retain his spot ahead of Gill
Despite having failed to make a mark in India’s only innings in Nagpur and having scored only 137 runs in his eight Tests innings across 2022, it looks as though KL Rahul will remain as India’s first choice opener in Delhi.
A cue on the same can also be taken from Dravid’s explanation on the think tank preferring those ‘who have been there’.

“Yeah, without being written in stone or written in rule, certainly, we value contributions of people who have been there and missed out due to injury. They really deserve the right to come back irrespective of what has happened in the time they have been injured.”
While Shubman has been firing on all cylinders of late across formats, having scored a double century and two century in ODIs, a maiden T20I and Test hundred over the past couple of months, the 23-year-old is likely to stay seated for the second Test.

An ode to sparkling serenity of Rohit Sharma’s batting stillness,"Mark Waugh evoked poetry when he batted, the Indian captain inspires lilting lyric","Rohit Sharma’s batting traps us inside an awed headspace. Watching him watch the bowler run in is a minimalistic marvel. A stillness has descended in recent years. Almost Jacques Kallis-ish compact serenity in the wait. The classicism in Rohit Sharma the Test opener seems so effortlessly natural and the aural and visual aesthetic of his timing and stroke play suffuses the senses so much that the sweat behind it is under-appreciated.
He has had at least two visible overhauls to his game to get here.
In his earlier days in international cricket, the compactness that seems so self-evident these days was missing. Even his stance was different. He would have his bat grounded, tapping away. The hands would come in from the gully. The front leg would press across at the first instance. Resultantly, the head wasn’t as still. The balance wasn’t as smooth. A ball that straightens around off-stump line could open him up, square-him up. An incoming ball could upset that head position even further as he had to withdraw his trespassing front leg, and try holding his balance. The hands glided into the shots as gracefully as now, the illusion of possessing extra time on his hands too was unmistakable, but the little imbalances would jar.
At the highest level, against pace, all these little things were carping away at the essence he owns now: stillness and compactness. It’s not as if he was a frequent lbw victim but was a potential lbw candidate. It wasn’t as if he was regularly edging outside-off balls, but he would keep the men behind him interested. Add to it the youthful impatience; his shot selections would often go awry.

He then changed his stance. Began picking up his bat while waiting. Cradling it in the air, wrists cocked in place. Suddenly he found himself more upright in his stance. The front foot stopped wandering out of control. Better balanced. More stable.
It seems he still wasn’t too happy with his wandering hands. As he mentioned a couple of years ago about the changes he made for a tour of England. “I changed certain aspects of my stance, keeping the hands closer to my body, and while doing that, my wrists were hurting so much because I was not used to doing something like that,” he told Revsports. “And to suddenly change, obviously your muscles are not used to that. It’s going to hurt, but I was prepared for it.”
The hands came closer to the body. The wandering angle of the bat vanished. The head stayed still-er and within line of the stumps; it wasn’t falling outside off, dragging him out of balance. As they say, the feet follow the head. Now, they were all syncing up.
ADVERTISEMENT
The front foot and the front shoulder opened up a touch; a natural inhibitor to the wandering foot. Compactness set in. No longer was he playing straight balls too square. No longer was he opening up to outside-off balls.
He does other tweaks of course. Within a series, against the same bowler, he would take different guards. To England’s Ollie Robinson he has moved from middle-stump to leg-stump. To someone like James Anderson from the other end, he would move to middle. With Virat Kohli, the world notices those movements, the effort. With Rohit, his beatific batting blinds us.
Shane Warne gasps. “Oh!”. Still can’t believe it. “Jesus”. When acceptance kicks in, Warne begins to cackle. Still incredulous: “Six!”. Finally, the enjoyment of full-throated laughter arrives: ’ha ha ha!”.
It’s a six off Pat Cummins in a Test match. Watch it to re-experience Warne’s emotions. It’s difficult to imagine Cummins caressed for a six over extra cover in a Test match in this fashion. It wasn’t as if quick runs were being hunted. Not that it was a great ball – on a hittable length and width outside off without much deviation, but the response was sweetly ballsy, non-violently violent – quite outrageous really, for its conception and execution.
ADVERTISEMENT
Where is Rohit Sharma’s game from? Nothing quite stands out in the Mumbai lineage of batsmen. Even the rest of India for that matter. If anybody comes close, perhaps it’s the Australian Mark Waugh. The sight of junior Waugh, a refreshing presence in the commentary panel in this series thus far, waiting at the crease was something else. It was as if he was standing on a beach front, all casual and cool; no unnecessary tensed muscle twitch, a bewitching elegance as if he were leaning on a bar counter, waiting for his drink. Rohit is inching towards that.
His nonchalant front-foot pulls and his lofted straight drives to length deliveries as if he were hitting stationary balls are rightfully celebrated but it’s his non-fussy defence that distills the essence of Rohit the Test opener. Rarely has a ball been anaesthetised so gracefully. Another graceful Indian Test opener in recent years was Murali Vijay, who would conjure up an elegant waft; a mere defensive push that would send the ball plummeting past the bewildered bowlers and mid-off. Sharma’s defence is more compact.

Arthur to be named Pakistan team director and consultant: PCB chief,PCB chief Sethi said a contract with Arthur would be inked in the next few days and a new team management will be announced.,"Former Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur will be appointed national team director and consultant before the T20 International series against Afghanistan in Sharjah next month, Board chief Najam Sethi said on Thursday.
PCB chief Sethi said a contract with Arthur would be inked in the next few days and a new team management will be announced.
Arthur, who has remained head coach of the Pakistan team between 2016 and 2019, will continue working with Derbyshire. He will travel with the Pakistan team when he is available from his Derbyshire duties.
“Chief Selector Haroon Rasheed is working with Arthur to finalise the names of the support staff that will work with the national team,” Sethi told reporters here.
He said all the support staff members would be announced with the consent of Arthur who had made recommendations for various positions.
Pakistan’s next international assignment is a three-match T20I series against Afghanistan in Sharjah in late March, soon after the Pakistan Super League ends on March 19.
Sethi said the decision to bring Arthur was taken because of his past work in Pakistan cricket and also since majority of the current pool of players have played under him.

“He knows out cricket culture and set-up and is respected by the players,” Sethi said.
Arthur’s tenure as head coach was not without controversies with his dislike for the Akmal brothers. He got into a much publicised argument with Umar Akmal at the high performance centre, leading to an inquiry from the PCB.
Pakistan’s former all-rounder Yasir Arafat who now lives in England is said to have confirmed his availability to work as bowling coach in the new support staff set-up but there was confusion over who will take over as head coach, assistant coach, batting coach and fielding coach.
Saqlain Mushtaq’s one-year contract as head coach ended earlier this month as did the contract of bowling coach Shaun Tait.

"Mooney, Healy hit unbeaten fifties as Australia beat SL by 10 wickets to virtually reach Women’s T20WC semis",Medium pacer Megan Schutt (4/24) returned with a four-wicket haul as Australia dished out a clinical bowling display to restrict Sri Lanka to 112 for 8 after opting to bowl.,"Beth Mooney and Alyssa Healy struck unbeaten half-centuries as defending champions Australia thrashed Sri Lanka by 10 wickets to virtually qualify for the semifinals of the Women’s T20 World Cup here on Thursday.
Medium pacer Megan Schutt (4/24) returned with a four-wicket haul as Australia dished out a clinical bowling display to restrict Sri Lanka to 112 for 8 after opting to bowl.
It turned out to be a cakewalk for Australia as Healy and and Mooney shared an unbeaten 113-run opening stand to chase down the target in 15.5 overs.
While Mooney remained unbeaten on 56 off 53 balls, Healy made 54 not out off 43 deliveries.
Mooney struck seven boundaries during her knock, while Healy decorated her innings with six fours and one hit over the fence as Australia continued their dominance in the tournament.
By virtue of this win, Australia consolidated their position at the top of Group 1 with three wins out of as many games, while Sri Lanka are placed second with two victories from three matches.
Australia will face hosts South Africa in their final game on Saturday, while Sri Lanka will be up against New Zealand a day later.

The total was too small a target for the formidable Australian batting line-up as Sri Lankan bowlers never looked threatening and struggled to break the dominant opening partnership, enabling the Southern Stars to register a commanding win.
Sent in to bat, Sri Lanka’s innings never got going as they lost wickets at regular intervals.
Harshitha Samarawickrama (34) and skipper Chamari Athapaththu (16) stitched 30 runs off 29 balls for the opening wicket before the latter was caught at mid-on by Grace Harris off the bowling of Ellyse Perry (1/20).
Samarawickrama, whose runs came off 40 balls with the help of three boundaries, then shared 39 runs with Vishmi Gunaratne (24).
But just when the partnership was looking dangerous, Samarawickrama was stumped by Alyssa Healy off Harris.

Harris struck again four balls later, accounting for Oshadi Ranasinghe for a duck.
Thereafter, Sri Lanka kept losing wickets at regular intervals to manage a below-par total.

"India vs Australia: At Kotla, Virat Kohli seeks home comfort in his quest to arrest Test form slump","Former India captain sweats it out at nets, invites left-arm spinner to address his concerns as he looks to return to form in the second Test against Australia.","A gaggle of teenagers hung restlessly outside the Virender Sehwag Gate, in the narrow alley flanked by brown-bricked walls, asking passers-by whether Virat Kohli is batting. A grumpy policeman yells at them and threatens to brandish his oiled cane-lathi. A stranger tells them, whether he was unaware or was merely playing around is unsure, he is practising. He even claimed he had spotted him spinning into the stadium in his ruby-red Porsche. Another bluntly informs them that he skipped the optional training session. Though uncertain, they hung around, in the hope that he would zip out in his car and wave his arms at them.
The whispers and debates at Kotla, even though he was absent on Thursday, revolved around Kohli. Whether he would end his century drought at home, whether you managed a selfie with him on Thursday, whether you saw his gleaming car, or how he batted in the nets or what he did at the nets. Kohli might be enduring the longest slump in his career, but his aura and stature in his home city have not diminished. The cricketing world might be debating whether he should be persisted with, after a harrowing run of 929 runs at 25.80 in 37 innings since December 2019, whether he is cruelly blocking the path of a deserving young cricketer, or whether he would ever rekindle his best Test match form. But the Kotla crowd is certain that he would rescale the lost peaks. Their love and hope remain undiminished and unconditional. “Is baar hoga,” is the collective belief. “Yaad hain woh Sri Lanka wali innings?” they would croon in an obvious reference to his 243 against Sri Lanka in the last Test here.

So seems Kohli’s determination to woo back the form. If he eventually fades away, he would not slip away without a fight, without a final flicker, without trying everything he possibly could to retrace the steps of greatness. At the nets, he sweats out as intensely as he ever had, ironing out his flaws, tightening his defending, and chalking out methods with the alacrity of a wide-eyed teenager who has just burst into international cricket.
Kohli checked in at 12 noon at the Ferozshah Kotla, even before the Indian team arrived, and batted in the nets. Kohli hasn’t played a Test match at his home ground in five years. He scored 243 and 50 in the drawn Test against Sri Lanka in 2017. Kohli hasn’t scored a Test hundred since November 2019. (Express photo: Praveen Khanna)
His recent nemesis has been left-arm spinners—seven times in the last 16 outings have they snared him, and alarmingly through different ways. So, he invited Uttar Pradesh’s Saurabh Kumar, a throwback loop-and-flight operator than the modern stump-to-stump one, to the nets and made him bowl until the bowler got utterly tired, on Wednesday. Kohli asked him to interchange his trajectories, from flat and fullish to loopy and slower, his length and pace. He scratched the rough just outside the off-stump and blast the ball in that area so that the ball would leap. Several times Kohli was beaten, especially when he looked to stretch forward and defend. But Kohli remained unbeaten in his spirit, encouraging Saurabh and asking him to probe the same area. Gradually, the front-foot stride became firmer and more definite. The switch of weight to either foot looked more seamless.

At one point, he asked him to bowl outside the leg stump and he would tickle it down the leg side. Such an attempt was his undoing in Nagpur, when he feathered a harmless delivery to the wicket-keeper Alex Carey off Todd Murphy. Most batsmen would dismiss it as a freak dismissal, but Kohli would get into the heart of it and address the weakness. His head was wavering a bit, his legs seemed a bit imbalanced, but this instance, the head was stiller, the weight on the backfoot perfect and the glance silken as it rammed onto the army green poles, inducing a smile on his face. At the end of the session, he placed a warm hand on Saurabh and thanked the other net bowlers, before he retreated into the massage room. By the time he came out, there was a sizeable crowd at the entrance beside his car, marvelled both by the man and the machine. After he reached home, he made an Instagram story on his drive to Kotla and wrote: “A long drive towards the stadium in Delhi after ages. Such a nostalgic failing.” He spends more time in Mumbai, but Delhi is where his heart and soul are. The city that forged his ideals, the city that made him.

Perhaps, a return to home was the blanket of warmth his Test career needed. Familiar ground and faces, the venue where his journey began and dreams sprouted, a ground he averages 77 in this format, and where his friends, relatives and acquaintances would flock to watch him, Kohli might feel fresher, younger and more confident of ending his century-drought here than anywhere else. He has already arrested his barren spell in white-ball cricket, an upturn of form that has seen him blast three hundreds in seven innings. Not just the runs he scored, but he found the joy back in his batting. It could be a proverbial matter of time before the hundreds come rolling in this format. But like super-athletes do, he is not waiting for that moment to arrive but rather reaching out for the moment. It’s a fascinating battle, a champion batsman battling to reach the heights he once inhabited, biting the ego, pushing his body and spirit, just so that he could breathe the air of that rarefied space again.
In his journey are his legions of admirers. But he would know that more than anywhere else in the world, the support in Kotla would be unconditional.

England women’s Rugby players to receive maternity cover,"The policy, which the RFU described as ""ground breaking"", also offers pregnant players the opportunity to move into other employment within rugby until they go on maternity leave.","The Rugby Football Union (RFU) announced a new maternity leave policy on Thursday, entitling contracted England women’s players to 26 weeks of fully paid leave and funds for children under a year old to travel with them to games.
The policy, which the RFU described as “ground breaking”, also offers pregnant players the opportunity to move into other employment within rugby until they go on maternity leave.
“I am confident that the policy will help normalise motherhood in sport and give players the best possible chance of returning to play… in a secure and safe way,” said England lock Abbie Ward, who announced her pregnancy last month.
The issue of maternity leave for professional athletes has gradually come into sharper focus in recent years.
Tennis star Serena Williams was denied a seeding at the 2018 French Open when she returned to competition after the birth of her daughter, leading to widespread criticism of the tournament organisers.
By the end of the year, the Women’s Tennis Association had changed its rules on maternity leave to offer players returning from pregnancy not just a protected ranking, but also a protected seeding.

Save the English manners for Ashes…leave the IPL buddies behind: Ravi Shastri lambasts Australia’s attitude ahead of the 2nd Test,"Shastri, who coached India in their 2-1 series triumph against Australia down under in 2020/21, also drew parallels between the state of Australia in the current series to that of India in 2020/21 four-Test series in Australia after they suffered a humiliating loss in Adelaide.","Even if on paper, many rooted Australia to lose against India in the Nagpur Test, not many would’ve pictured them bowing out inside eight sessions by a whooping 132 runs and an innings, leaving them 1-0 behind in the four Test series.
Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has now warned the visiting side to switch their attitude in order to make a comeback in the series.
“I want to start off with a strong piece of advice for the Australian team. Save the English manners for the Ashes. What you need are good old Australian manners here in India to bounce back from the defeat in Nagpur,” Shastri wrote in his column in the Sydney Morning Herald.
He further added, “I want to see them come out and be their aggressive selves in Delhi. To back their ability and play with intent. I was surprised by the lack of it, especially in that second innings, where they were rolled for 91. If you lose, go down throwing punches. Not in the timid, almost un-Australian, fashion that they surrendered against the Indian spinners at the VCA Stadium. But the punch has to be thrown immediately, and they need to hit India hard from the very start in Delhi. If Australia don’t get at India right away, the possibility of a 3-0 or even a 4-0 series defeat looms large.”
Shastri, who is part of the broadcast team for the 2023 Border Gavaskar Trophy, further emphasized the need of Pat Cummins and co. dropping the warm shoulder against the Indian players, many of whom they feature alongside in the Indian Premier League (IPL).
“I would also ask the Aussies to leave their Indian Premier League buddies behind and keep them for later. It felt like there was a bit too much bonhomie on the field in Nagpur for my liking. I want to see that characteristic hard-hitting Aussie intent come to the fore in Delhi. I can say this with confidence: the Indians will be relentless, as they are always in India. This is as good a bowling attack as they’ve ever had, both in terms of the fast bowlers and the spinners. India have never had a spin trio where all three are all-rounders. It’s not all lost for the Aussies though, and they need to tell themselves that. Look yourself in the mirror and realise that you’re not as bad as what transpired on Saturday. It was one day, one session where you messed up,” he wrote.

The 60-year-old, who coached India in their 2-1 series triumph against Australia down under in 2020/21, also dropped the deuce on the visitors, suggesting for possible motivation to be taken from the Indian team that marked a comeback in Australia three years back after losing the first of four Tests in Adelaide.

“It is rather like when the Indian team was bowled out for 36 at the Adelaide Oval in 2020. It was understandably one of the more challenging days for me as coach. The only difference, though, was that the Indian team had dominated the first two days of play in Adelaide before that incredible collapse. In Nagpur, Australia had few positives, except the sensational debut for young Todd Murphy,” he said.
Australia’s shocker of a defeat last week came after captain Pat Cummins won the toss and opted to bat first on day one, bundling out for 177 on the very same day. India’s 400 in the second proved to be one too many as Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja wreaked havoc, picking a sum total of 15 wickets across the two innings leading to Australia being bundled out for 91 in the second.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-australia-ravi-shastri-delhi-test-ipl-buddies-nagpur-8449745/,sports
IND vs AUS: Australia will need to play like India to beat India in Delhi Test,"To climb out of Nagpur-sized hole, Australia would need grit and gumption, discipline and desire, the virtues that once defined Australia and now define India.","The afternoon sun emerged from the veil of haze, and half a dozen Australians practising at the prosaic Kotla B nets, where washed curtains were put to dry on the side and torn cricket kits lay ignored by men and time, suddenly discovered their intensity. The faces grew intense, the chatter and banter stopped. You could only hear the screech of studs pounding the turf, the crack of leather on wood and Marnus Lahuschagne’s self-appraisals and self-admonishing. Depending on his level of satisfaction, he would break into an aside: “I like that shot,” or “I am so stupid.” Beside him, Matt Renshaw and Travis Head, after an extended session of bowling off-spin, batted with the grim urgency of a battalion guarding the last bunker from being blown up by their onrushing adversaries.
The Kotla Test is arguably Australia’s last hope of keeping the series alive as well as restoring the tattered reputation. Lose this, and they might slip uncontrollably into the abyss of embarrassment. Here, near the ruins of the Kotla Fort, would begin their own journey of picking up their pieces from the Nagpur debris, as well as the soul of their game, the ideals that had defined them, the defiance and ruthlessness, fight and fire, on which they built the empire of dominance. The number 91—their second-lowest score against India—captured the shambles.

The volume of criticism from back home has already shot to deafening levels. But more than the skills, they lashed out at Australia’s meekness. “They didn’t have the hard edge,” Allan Border blasted. A host of former captains and legends chorused his views. Almost all of them lamented their lack of fight. Prevalent is a school of thought that Australians are not combative and fearless as they once were. Even Pat Cummins and the coach Andrew McDonald have not been spared, and many consider them as soft, an embodiment of the flaws in Australian cricket, though to be fair, the India series is the toughest test yet for them. The demand to bring back former coach Justin Langer, a tough-as-nails personality, has seldom been louder. The Kotla Test, thus, is as much a test of their bouncebackability as their ability to rediscover the lost ideals.

What could hurt them deeper is that India displayed the same streak of virtues that Australia had embodied in their invulnerable peak, to the effect that the new India were the old Australia in disguise, endowed with the remarkable gift of not just fighting back, but winning vital moments to ensure that the match doesn’t dribble onto a juncture wherein they are praying for magic and miracle to save them.  Earlier teams required miraculous interventions to beat them, like Barbados 1997 and Kolkata 2001. The defeats of Australia in that era are remembered and bracketed in the miracle category because they were tough to beat, impenetrable and impregnable, just as India is.

The Nagpur Test, like the summer as a whole, was a demonstration of India’s focussed, ruthless cricket. The batting was orthodox, the captaincy unfunky, and there were no balls of the century. But India refused to concede an inch, ball by ball driving Australia to distraction and disenchantment. The outcome was something statistically jaw-dropping, inflicting an innings and 132-run crushing, but the gaudy numbers being etched into history are underpinned by discipline, graft and ruthlessness. Bowling first—not just the fear of bowling when the conditions are best for batting but the dread of batting last—hardly bothered them. They bundled Australia for 177. In reply, they teetered at 168 for five, but worry not, a familiar lower-order fightback followed, that continued even after the departure of centurion Rohit Sharma.
It was so reminiscent of Australia that generations grew up watching with covetous adulation. A top-order collapse, or a middle-order meltdown, but there always bursts forth a hero, a redeemer from the skies. If Rohit was the Nagpur saviour, it was Cheteshwar Pujara in Chattogram, Ravindra Jadeja in Mohali, Shreyas Iyer in Kanpur and so on and so forth. There always is someone, with the bat or the ball, and often both these days, like the all-round spin trio of Jadeja, Ravi Ashwin and Axar Patel. So much so that they could afford the luxury of granting their best batsman of the generation the time to rediscover his form.
This was once the Aussie pattern and their non-pattern in Nagpur. In the first innings, an hour either side of lunch, both Labuschagne and Smith batted as smoothly as any pair of Australian batsmen in Asia, but Labuschagne’s 49 remained their highest score in the game. Undeniably, a series in India cannot be won on the dazzle of one man alone, you need a raft of performers, but a guiding light could lead the rest of the flock from darkness to light. Needed is a Prometheus who stole the light from the heavens.
Some of the batsmen could rethink their approach, like shot-shy David Warner, or rejig their plans, like the sweep-savvy Alex Carey. The flexibility of plans of India’s batsmen is tough to replicate, but adamant adherence to failing methods would not benefit them.

Their endeavour to restore the lost soul of the game should begin from their batsmen, but the bowlers are not beyond scrutiny. Cummins’s uncharacteristically loose spell with the first new ball proved costly. As were the struggles of Nathan Lyon, whose 49 overs of erring lengths and faltering lines, produced just a wicket. He was economical, but the first-choice spinner is expected to pick wickets rather than deny run-scoring opportunities.
Thus, bouncing back from the Nagpur thrashing is a collective as well as personal endeavour, the latter seamlessly leading to the other. In this context, India’s stirring comeback from being 36 all out to winning the series Down Under has been forked up as an example of bouncing back from galling defeats. After the Nagpur win, both Sharma and Cummins were reminded of the series. Sharma grinned; Cummins smiled.
The difference is that India didn’t have to play with the pink ball in seaming conditions for the rest of that series; here Australia are likely to be dragged again into drier surfaces.

"Ranji Trophy Final: Saurashtra’s Unadkat, Sakariya leave Bengal in tatters",Left-arm pace duo share six wickets between them to bundle out Bengal for 174. Visitors end Day 1 on 81/2.,"On the eve of the Ranji Trophy final, Bengal skipper Manoj Tiwary told this newspaper that he wanted a spicy pitch with pace and bounce as Saurashtra’s batsmen thrived on “low and slow” surfaces. Tiwary got exactly what he wanted but the surface proved a double-edged sword, and it was the visitors who made better use of the conditions. They operated on a probing line that teased the batsmen’s off-stump as their bowlers called the shots on Day 1 at Eden Gardens on Thursday.
Jaydev Unadkat won the toss and opted to bowl on a green-top. The Saurashtra skipper (3/44) and Chetan Sakariya (3/33) made the new ball talk and left the hosts reeling at 17/4 inside five overs.

England in command of first test as ‘Bazball’ hits New Zealand,"New Zealand were in trouble at 37 for three at stumps in reply to England's declared first innings total of 325 for nine at Bay Oval, with seven wickets tumbling in a frantic evening session.","A swashbuckling England raced to a sporting total with the bat then crashed through New Zealand’s top order as “Bazball” made its pink ball debut on day one of the first test in Mount Maunganui on Thursday.
New Zealand were in trouble at 37 for three at stumps in reply to England’s declared first innings total of 325 for nine at Bay Oval, with seven wickets tumbling in a frantic evening session.
Opener Devon Conway was 18 not out and nightwatchman Neil Wagner was on four, with James Anderson grabbing two wickets and Ollie Robinson one.
Tim Southee won the toss and sent England in to bat on a green-tinged wicket but the home captain may have rued the call at the end of the night with his team trailing by 288 runs.
Quick-fire half-centuries by Ben Duckett (84) and Harry Brook (89) took the wind out of the hosts’ sails and set the platform for a sporting declaration by Ben Stokes.
Having seen four of his batsmen fall at short order when night fell, Stokes could see similar carnage unfolding for New Zealand.
“The best time to bowl is under these lights,” Brook told reporters of the declaration after only 58.2 overs.

“I think you can extract the most amount of swing and seam, so why not expose their top order to that?”
The home batsmen survived four overs of probing swing from Anderson and Stuart Broad but Robinson struck with his third ball to remove Tom Latham for one, the opener caught by a diving Ollie Pope at short leg.

Anderson then had Conway edge straight to second slip but Zak Crawley put down the easiest of chances to reprieve the opener on nine.
Kane Williamson (6) was not so lucky, rapped on the pads by an Anderson ball that angled in. Umpire Aleem Dar ignored the lbw appeal but it was confirmed on review.
Crawley later made amends by catching Henry Nicholls for four to secure Anderson’s second wicket. It was an impressive display from the evergreen Anderson but earlier in the day it was the new boys starring.
Opener Duckett raced to 50 with 36 balls and appeared destined for a century but he ended up driving straight to Michael Bracewell at short mid-off, gifting New Zealand’s debutant quick Blair Tickner his first test wicket.

Duckett and Pope got England off to a rollicking start, the tourists smashing 134 in the first session for the loss of only Crawley (4) and Joe Root (14).
Duckett needed only 68 balls for his 84 and Pakistan tormentor Brook continued the T20-style batting, making his 89 from 81 deliveries. The 23-year-old Yorkshireman has now racked up an astonishing 569 runs, including three centuries, in his seven innings in test cricket. His partnership with wicketkeeper Ben Foakes (38) ensured England racked up another 145 runs in the second session, smacking down the hosts after they had rallied with three wickets.
Proper innings from Brooky 👏

Paceman Wagner finished with 4-82 and took his 250th wicket, recovering strongly after a wayward first session. Southee (2-71) bowled with customary discipline but all four of New Zealand’s seamers conceded above five runs an over.
Paceman Scott Kuggeleijn, New Zealand’s second test debutant, took two wickets and dismissed Stokes for 19 when the skipper miscued a pull shot straight to Latham in close.

"WPL: Ellyse Perry reveals she’s always had soft spot for RCB, thanks to ‘twist of fate’",Ellyse Perry also called India as the spiritual home of cricket in a lot of senses. ,"Even as she admitted the concept of auctions was “weird”, Australian star Ellyse Perry said it was “pretty cool” to be picked by the Royal Challengers Bangalore side in the Women’s Premier League auctions. She went on to reveal that she has always had a “soft spot” in her heart for RCB since she was in the stadium to watch the first game of the men’s team live in the stadium.
She was picked up by RCB for Rs 1.7 crore earlier this week. 13 of her Australian compatriots were also picked in the WPL auctions. Many of those, like Perry, are currently in South Africa competing in the ICC T20 World Cup.  
“A big hello and a big thank you for the opportunity to play with RCB in the first ever WPL,” Perry told RCB’s website in a video shot after the auctions. “I’m so excited for this tournament and everything it means for the women’s game.  It is kind of really cool because the twist of fate was that I was actually at the first-ever RCB game for men many years ago. Since then, RCB has always had a bit of a soft spot in my heart. I suppose it was this twist of fate and now being part of the first-ever women’s team is super cool.”
She also said that the WPL meant more than about the money for them: it was about the growth of the women’s game.

She also lauded India as the spiritual home of cricket in a lot of senses.
“I think now that women are starting to have a really strong presence in the Indian market and also in the Indian game, that is so much more important than any kind of dollar value that is placed on any player. So from that perspective, the chat was just around wanting to be involved,” she said. “Of course, after the auction, those discussions come in about certain value and how much people are sold for, which in itself is a weird kind of concept to swallow.

“When I started playing cricket and then made my (Test) debut, I never thought about playing hundred Test matches. For me, it is always about being in the present and not thinking too far ahead. So, for me, I thought before this series started and that’s when I realised that I will be playing my hundredth Test match. In a career, you always go through ups and downs, and you have to fight through those periods,” Cheteshwar Pujara said in the pre-match press conference on Thursday.
India must win the second Test against Australia in Delhi, which begins on Friday, to maintain their lead in the Test rankings and come closer to qualifying for the World Test Championship final in June. To qualify for the final, India must win the series 3-1 or 3-0.

When Pujara takes to the field against Australia in the second Test at Delhi from February 17 onwards, he will become only the 13th player to reach the landmark of 100 Test matches for India. The most number of Test matches in cricket is played by legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, who is the only cricketer to have played 200 matches in the longer format.
“There is a lot more to achieve. I am definitely satisfied and really excited to play this hundredth Test match. But at the same time, we are playing an important series. So, hopefully, we win this Test match and move on to win another Test match which will ensure we will qualify for the WTC final. My dream is to win a WTC final for the Indian team, which didn’t happen in the last final. But hopefully, once we qualify, we move towards that,” he added.

Pujara has played 99 Tests so far. He has scored 7,021 runs at an average of 44.15 in his 13-year-long Test career, having made his debut in 2010. He has a total of 19 centuries and 34 fifties in the format, with the best score of 206*. In five matches last year, he scored 409 runs at an average of 45.44. One century and three fifties came out of his bat last year, with the best score of 102*.

Manchester City and the bruising battle to avoid losing it all,"City has expressed surprise at the charges. The club has long rejected claims of financial misdeeds as an “organized and clear attempt” to damage its reputation. Last week, it said it welcomed the chance to present its “comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence” that it had done nothing wrong.","By Tariq Panja
The phone rang at 8 a.m., and the Manchester City communications official answered right away. A reporter was on the line, requesting comment on the news emanating from the Middle East that morning in 2008: that City, a Premier League soccer team with an unremarkable history and dust gathering in its trophy cabinet, had just been purchased by a wealthy Arab sheikh, the brother of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates.
“Have we?” the City official replied, apparently unaware that the deal that would transform City’s fortunes and upend European soccer had been finalized overnight. “I’m going to have to call you back.”
Within an hour, the news that Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan had become the owner of Manchester City was out. A new era had begun. With the stroke of a pen, a venerable, well-liked and occasionally tragicomic member of English soccer’s establishment had become one of the richest teams on the planet, a usurper-in-waiting to the game’s elite.
Over the next decade, that is precisely what has happened.
Bankrolled by its Gulf ownership’s ambition and seemingly limitless wealth, City began signing star players and collecting trophies one, two, three at a time. In doing so, it not only toppled its neighbor and rival, Manchester United, as the preeminent sporting force in its city, it also left the rest of the Premier League trailing in its wake, too.
But its successes and its spending have brought years of scrutiny, and grumbling that Manchester City — through inflated sponsorships, secret contracts and muscular legal maneuvering — wasn’t playing by the same financial rules as everyone else.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)
On Feb. 6, the Premier League made that case, too, quietly uploading a statement to its website announcing that it had charged City with a laundry list of financial rules violations. In their most basic interpretation, the 115 charges make a stunning allegation: that the league’s serial champion is also a serial cheat.
City has expressed surprise at the charges. The club has long rejected claims of financial misdeeds as an “organized and clear attempt” to damage its reputation. Last week, it said it welcomed the chance to present its “comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence” that it had done nothing wrong.
The stakes are hard to overstate. Under the rules of the Premier League, City, if it is found guilty, faces a range of punishments up to and including expulsion from the league. It is little wonder, then, that a club that has spent years waging clandestine legal wars to defend its interests, and its name, would now be digging in for its most serious fight yet, one that threatens to bring all that it has built crashing down.
A Legal Army
Manchester City might be the only soccer club in England whose fans would unfurl a 100-foot banner to herald the hiring of the team’s newest lawyer. Yet there it was on Sunday: 6-foot-high block letters in City’s sky blue, bracketed by the club’s crest and the lawyer’s photo and declaring, “Pannick on the Streets of London.”

The banner, a winking reference to a song by the Smiths, celebrated the news that City, bracing for its battle with the Premier League, had retained the services of the respected British lawyer David Pannick. And while the fans’ public devotion to the club’s newest cause, and its newest champion, was colorful, it was not particularly unusual.
Many of those same fans have long cheered City’s pugnacious stance in the face of accusations and its reliance on an army of lawyers to defend the club’s interests, be it in financial cases brought by European soccer’s governing body, UEFA; accusations that its wealth has unfairly tilted the playing field; or threats of sporting sanctions from the Premier League or anyone else.
The supporters’ disdain is matched by the official club line: Manager Pep Guardiola last week painted the club as a victim of attempts to undermine it by its rivals, days before the crowd at City’s stadium booed the Premier League’s pregame anthem — adding it to the UEFA version, which it has jeered for years — and sang, “We’re Man City and we’ll cheat when we want!”

Pannick, a bespectacled, Oxford-educated 66-year-old, is no stranger to such fights. In 2020, he advised Manchester City in its successful appeal of one of the harshest sanctions soccer’s financial regulators had ever handed out: a two-year ban from the Champions League, the sport’s richest club competition.
ADVERTISEMENT
That case had grown out of an infamous leak of a trove of City emails, messages and documents known as Football Leaks. The product of a hacking campaign led by a Portuguese college dropout, the documents appeared to reveal years of a financial sleight of hand in which City evaded soccer’s cost-control rules by inflating the value of its sponsorship revenues at the same time it was obscuring the rising costs on its balance sheet.
But the leaks also pulled back the curtain on much more: the contempt that City executives and their lawyers held for soccer’s financial rules and the individuals tasked with enforcing them; a bare-knuckle legal strategy to overwhelm opponents with filings and expenses in a legal war of attrition; and a willingness, directed from the upper reaches of the club, to fight any challenge to its business, and its ambitions, to the bitter end.
Deep Pockets
Manchester City’s new Gulf owners hit the ground running.
Only hours after the buyout by Mansour was announced, the club signaled nothing would get in the way of its plan to join soccer’s elite by acquiring Robinho, a Brazilian forward then at Real Madrid. The price was the highest ever paid by a British club for a single player.
ADVERTISEMENT
Within months, the deep pockets of the Abu Dhabi United Group, the investment vehicle for the new ownership, and a new class of wealthy owners were already driving up prices for players across Europe. And soccer’s old guard began pushing back.
Worried about growing losses across the industry and alarmed by the seemingly unlimited spending ability of Russian billionaires like Chelsea’s Roman Abramovich and multibillion-dollar Gulf investment funds like the one that controlled City, European soccer officials announced plans for new cost-control regulations aimed at tackling clubs’ soaring losses and growing debts. The Premier League, too, began to formulate its own financial regulations.
For City, caps on unfettered spending represented clear roadblocks to its pursuit of more entrenched rivals, since the regulations — in their crudest form — limited the amount of money clubs could lose in pursuit of on-field success. So it became imperative to find new sources of income before the regulations came into effect.
City’s management knew exactly where to look. One after another, companies linked to Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates signed on as City sponsors. The national flag carrier Etihad Airways would soon see its name emblazoned across City sky-blue shirts. The stadium where it played its home games would soon be renamed for the company, too. Etisalat, a telecommunications company that is majority owned by the Emirati government, joined up, too, as would several others.
ADVERTISEMENT
The deals helped finance the team’s sudden rise — City won the Premier League title on the final day of the 2012 season, and then added another two years later — but they did not cover all of the team’s spending, and that caught the eye of soccer’s financial regulators. In 2014, Manchester City and another Gulf-backed club with big ambitions, the Qatar-owned Paris St.-Germain, agreed to a settlement with UEFA after being found to have been in breach of the governing body’s financial regulations.
A multimillion-dollar fine was imposed, an outcome palatable to City, but the chief investigator in the case was so angered by the settlement that he quit on the day it was announced. City, meanwhile, went right on spending: on players, on coaches and on lawyers.
In 2018, months after Manchester City’s latest star signing, Guardiola, clinched the first of his four league titles at the club, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel published a four-part series that it said exposed the foundations underpinning City’s rise.
Citing scores of leaked documents and emails, Der Spiegel rolled out one revelation after another. In one article, it reported that one of City’s former managers had reportedly been paid more than his annual salary — almost $2 million — for a four-day consultancy contract with another soccer team, one based in Abu Dhabi and also owned by Mansour. In another, it said that Etihad, City’s main sponsor, was paying only a fraction of a sponsorship deal said to be worth 67.5 million pounds ($81 million) per season. A vast majority of the money, the article said, was covered by other entities linked to City’s owners or the government of the UAE.
ADVERTISEMENT
UEFA took notice of the articles and, in late 2018, it said it had opened an investigation into City’s finances. The Premier League, with much less fanfare, did the same.
A Pattern of Obstruction
UEFA investigators found out almost immediately that getting City to cooperate in their inquiry — assistance that was required under the governing body’s statutes — would be one of their biggest challenges.
By the time the UEFA investigators finished their work, though, they were convinced that City had committed “a series of very serious breaches” between 2012 and 2016. They calculated sponsorship revenue had been overstated by more than 200 million pounds (about $243 million) in that four-year window alone. A few months later, a judiciary chamber issued its ruling in the case, agreeing with Leterme’s suggestion that City be expelled from the Champions League, UEFA’s richest competition, for two years.
The penalty would have been the harshest ever handed down for breaking fiscal regulations, but City promptly began a new legal fight, bringing an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
ADVERTISEMENT
City has since claimed the ruling that followed as a total vindication of its financial operations, but the court had not weighed in on the specifics of the most serious charges. Instead, City had persuaded the judges that a majority of the case was time barred under UEFA’s own rules.
The technicality invoked by City’s lawyers clinched the case. The Champions League ban was thrown out.
A New Fight
While UEFA was winning, and then losing, its fight with Manchester City, the Premier League had come under pressure from its own teams to look into City’s books. In 2019, the league finally confirmed that it was. On Monday of last week, it laid out its charges — the product of more than four years of exhausting, expensive and attritional combat with City’s lawyers.
Unlike UEFA, however, the Premier League has no time limit on how far back its investigations can reach. An independent disciplinary panel is being convened to hear the City case. Its result might not be known for months, or even years.
Leterme, though, said he expected that the league’s inquiry — however long it takes — will eventually arrive at the same conclusion he and his colleagues did. “I am convinced that they have been cheating,” he said, “and I am convinced at least they have not been cooperating as they should have been.”
City, meanwhile, is digging in for its latest fight, and hiring lawyers like Pannick to guide it. Among the charges it faces are several suggesting it has obstructed the Premier League investigation, accusations mirrored by those alleged in the UEFA case. The club has already gone to court to challenge the league’s jurisdiction to investigate it, and then returned to try to keep details of those hearings quiet. “They have tried to bury them in paper,” said one person familiar with the Premier League case.

The slow pace of the investigation was noted by Stephen Males, one of the High Court judges that heard City’s attempt to keep quiet the details of its challenge to the Premier League’s authority.
“This is an investigation which commenced in December 2018,” Males wrote. “It is surprising, and a matter of legitimate public concern, that so little progress has been made after 2 1/2 years — during which, it may be noted, the club has twice been crowned as Premier League champions.”
City would go on to add another title before the Premier League announced its charges — its sixth in just over a decade. By the time the verdict in Manchester City vs. the Premier League arrives, it may have added yet more. Whether those will be something to celebrate may not be clear for some time.

"Amidst speculations of leaving UEFA to join AFC, Russia to compete in South Asian U-17 women’s championship",The development comes amidst speculations of Russia leaving the European confederation and joining Asia after its teams were banned by IDEA following the invasion of Ukraine last February.,"After almost a year away from international football, Russia will make a comeback next month – in a South Asian competition.
The country, which has so far competed as a part of Europe in tournaments organised by UEFA, will be competing in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship for under-17 women, scheduled to be held in Dhaka from March 20-28.
The development comes amidst speculations of Russia leaving the European confederation and joining Asia after its teams were banned by IDEA following the invasion of Ukraine last February.
SAFF is a sub-confederation within the Asian Football Confederation and has India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal as member nations.
Earlier this week, SAFF announced the decision on social media. “We are delighted to announce that Russia will be competing in SAFF U17 Women’s Championship 2023…” a statement read.
Last year, Russian Football Union president Aleksander Dyukov said switching from UEFA to AFC was an option for the country as the national team and clubs try to return to the international fold. The move, however, could be resisted by Asian nations as it will only increase the level of competition in an already-tough region.
The move to allow a Russian team to play in South Asia is in continuation of the efforts to include athletes from the country in Asian events, with the Olympic Council of Asia inviting Russian athletes to compete in its events, including the Asian Games this year.

"IND vs AUS: Australia should ‘play three seamers, one spinner’ in Delhi Test, says Allan Border","And which spinner that would be, considering Todd Murphy, the debutant, picked a five-for out bowling Nathan Lyon. Border has no confusion.","Should Australia play with two spinners or go with three seamers in the Delhi Test? Allan Border, former Australian captain, believes regardless of the pitch, Australia should go with their strength of playing three seamers and one spinner.
And which spinner that would be, considering Todd Murphy, the debutant, picked a five-for out bowling Nathan Lyon. Border has no confusion.
“You’ve got to go with Lyon, he’s built up enough brownie points over the years to be the first picked,” Border told SEN radio. “Well done to young Murphy, it’s going to be a tough decision to leave him out, I know the wicket is going to turn but I just reckon the formula for us to be successful (is) three quickies and one spinner.
Nathan Lyon during practice session at Delhi’s Arun Jaitley stadium on Wednesday. (Express Photo- Praveen Khanna)
Border is gung-ho on the three-seamers-one-spinner tactic for Australia.
“Just bowl stump to stump and be relentless with that tactic, I think that is going to be better for us than trying to beat them with spin, we’ve tried that forever and ever, and it hasn’t worked.
“That formula just isn’t working, and we need to go back to what does work and that is with the quickies.”
The absence of Cameron Green has affected the Australian apple-cart in terms of balance, as he can bowl fast medium pace.
ADVERTISEMENT
Border’s views were actually echoed by Adam Gilchrist, even before the Test series had started.
“So often teams go to India hoping to unveil some new spinner that’s going to come in and adapt and bedazzle in India — it doesn’t really happen,” Adam Gilchrist had told Fox Sports.
“Pick your best four bowlers, run with them — and if that is three seamers who can all get really nice reverse swing and Nathan Lyon, who’s outstanding and clearly the best off-spinner we’ve ever had, can play his role — that’s my gut feeling. You do that, you go with it.”
Gilchrist was Australia’s captain in 2004 when they last won a series in India.

“What we tried to change with our mentality back then — and I’d be interested to see if the Australians do it this time — is don’t go searching and just rolling spinners out there.
“Attack the stumps right from ball one.

Ian Healy picks Travis Head as his future ‘Australian captain’. Border slams selectors for dropping Head in the first Test,Ian Healy also predicted that Travis Head will soon become the Test opener.,"Former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy has picked Travis Head, who was dropped for the first Test against India, as the future “Australian captain”.
“(He’s) a possible captain. Who’s our next captain? I don’t think Marnus is a captaincy type… and Travis Head is. He captained South Australia since he was 21 and we’re mucking him around at a time we need to be revving him up,” Healy said on Sen radio. Head is 29 years old, the same age as the current Test captain Pat Cummins.
Healy also predicted that Head will soon become the Test opener.
“I think he’ll be our opener before long. He’ll replace one of Khawaja and Warner, whoever goes first. They might both go at the same time, and Travis Head will be our Australia opener.” Head has opened 18 times in ODIs for an average of 51.3.
Head found more support from the former Australian captain Allan Border, who was aghast that Head wasn’t picked for the first Test in Nagpur.
“I thought he must have been crook or injured himself…. I just couldn’t believe that Travis Head could be left just on a win that he didn’t play very well in India last time or when they were in Sri Lanka,” Border said on Sen radio.
It was reported that Head was dropped for the first Test for Australia’s horses-for-courses strategy, based on his past performances in India. Border believes the team management “overthought” the issue.

"India vs Australia: Decision not to play a tour match was flawed, Darren Lehmann tells SMH","Australia prepared for the tour at North Sydney Oval, followed by a short training camp in India.","Darren Lehmann, who toured India as a player, making his Test debut in Bengaluru in 1998 and coached Australia to the only win in the 2017 Pune Test questioned the decision to allow the players to continue in the Big Bash League rather than head to the subcontinent early, speaking to Sydney Morning Herald. He also questioned their decision to not play a tour game.
Australia prepared for the tour at North Sydney Oval, followed by a short training camp in India.
“Ideally, they should have played a tour game,” he told SMH.
“They don’t like to do that because the tour match we played last time was on a green wicket.
“But it’s still batting for a long period of times in the heat and getting used to the ball, things like that. So a tour game would have been handy ideally, but they decided to do the BBL, but maybe they needed a tour game.
“It’s easy in hindsight, though, isn’t it.”
Leaving Head out a mistake
The f﻿ormer coach called the the decision to omit Travis Head from the first Test in Nagpur as “ridiculous.”
“Not playing Head was ridiculous, and he could have bowled some extra overs. The hardest thing for him now is how is he going to try and stay in the side after having such an amazing two years at home, ” Lehmann said.

“If he’s ever going to succeed it was going to be off the back of the confidence the home series gave him.
“Obviously they had their reasons but the records of the other blokes aren’t overly flattering either apart from Smith, and Labuschagne is obviously a good player of spin,” SMH quoted him as saying.

The day after, Beckham was seen with a mysterious cut above his eye and it was reported that Ferguson kicked a boot at Beckham’s face during a dressing room altercation between the two.","It’s been 20 years since David Beckham and Sir Alex Ferguson were involved in arguably the most famous dressing room incident of all time.
Sportbible revisiting the incident recalled how back in 2003, Manchester United were up against arch-rivals Arsenal in the FA Cup and Ryan Giggs had squandered a huge chance to put his side ahead, with Arsenal winning 2-0.
A furious questioned Beckham’s work rate during what ended as his final year at Old Trafford. The day after, Beckham was seen with a mysterious cut above his eye and it was reported that Ferguson kicked a boot at Beckham’s face during a dressing room altercation between the two.
Sportbible quotes Beckham as saying the incident was blown out of proportion. He said: “I’d made a couple of mistakes during the game and he came into the dressing room and a few harsh words were exchanged.
“He started to walk over to me and he kicked out at a pile of clothes on the floor. Out came this boot and then I quickly realised how accurate his kick had been as it struck me on the head, but there weren’t any hard feelings.
“It was a complete freak accident. As far as we were concerned. it was forgotten straight away within the club, but the incident made the papers which meant that people started to speculate about our relationship.”
Ferguson’s version as per his autobiography via The Mirror: “He was around 12 feet from me. Between us on the floor lay a row of boots. David swore. I moved towards him, and as I approached I kicked a boot.

"IND vs AUS: Australia’s spin succession plan post Nathan Lyon- Murphy, Kuhnemann & Sangha, writes Fox sports",Jadeja-fan Kuhnemann will look to make a mark,"Nathan Lyon has played 94 consecutive Tests for Australia, not missing even one. But Australia played 12 different spinners in 69 Tests before they found a replacement for Shane Warne in Lyon, says Fox sports in a piece that delves into the Australian plan to replace Nathan Lyon when he hangs up his boots.
Todd Murphy, Matt Kuhnemann and Tanveer Sangha are the trio marked out to take on the mantle once Lyon makes his exit, as per Fox.
Adding that Murphy and Kuhnemann were “not thrown in the deep end in India this month; they are well-accustomed to the subcontinent conditions courtesy of CA initiatives over the last 12 months,” Fox cited how both spinners took part in last year’s Australia A tour against Sri Lanka. Murphy claimed 4-52 from 19 overs in Hambantota, with Kuhnemann claiming two wickets before earning a surprise ODI call-up.
“You get to experience different conditions around the world to best prepare someone like (Murphy) to take Nathan’s spot when he finishes up or retires,” former all rounder and spinner Cameron White told foxsports.

cricket.com.au)
“It’s a bit of a priority for Cricket Australia, those Australia A tours, which I think the players really enjoy, and there’s a fair few of them on the schedule going forward.”
Murphy, Kuhnemann and New South Wales leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha trained at the MRF Academy in Chennai last year, and Murphy seems to have gained from touring these subcontinent’s unique conditions.
“That was an awesome opportunity, just to get over there and experience the different conditions was massive for me,” Murphy had told foxsports.com.au earlier. “It’s going to be more beneficial when I do get to go back there, being able to call upon the experiences I’ve had … just finding ways to get the ball doing different things over there was probably what I took out of it.”

Kuhnemann would tell abc sport ahead of the tour: “I was fortunate to stay on that tour with the Test guys and just bowl in the nets for a few weeks and just watch how the Sri Lankan bowlers played and how Nathan Lyon bowled. Just being around that group gives me a lot of confidence heading over to India.”
He idolises Ravindra Jadeja.
“He’s one of my favourites, if not my favourite to watch. He bowled beautifully. That’s sort of how I’ve gone about my bowling … basing my game around him and Axar Patel,” ABC would quote him as saying.
Challenges in finding spinners
Australia’s seam-friendly, drop-in pitches mean none of the Sheffield Shield’s 20 leading wicket-takers during the 2019/20 season were spinners. Fox added that
Queensland leggie Mitchell Swepson, recently Australia’s second-choice Test spinner, played very few Sheffield Shield matches throughout his career because the wickets favoured pace bowling.
“It’s unfortunate – at the start of the year, I couldn’t give (Swepson) the ball as often because we were playing on raging green tops,” Queensland captain Usman Khawaja was quoted as saying by Fox. “It’s really hard, even for me as a captain, to get (Swepson) into the game when the ball is hooping around corners. ”

Sheffield Shield pitches have been considerably more balanced over the last couple of years, Fox reports and NSW selected two strike spinners for recent first-class matches at the SCG, while Victoria also employed twin tweakers, permitting Murphy to accompany veteran Jon Holland.
“The wickets have been drier,” Steve O’Keefe told foxsports.com.au earlier this summer. “Wickets have been more (spin) friendly. In some cases, pitches have spun on day one. If we’re being honest and going away and wanting to play and win in the subcontinent, we need to accept the fact it’s going to spin on day one and be prepared for that. I think (Sheffield Shield) pitches are starting to reflect that.”
Though Kuhnemann, who was rushed into Australia’s Test squad, only played twice for the Bulls this summer because Queensland couldn’t justify playing him alongside Swepson on Brisbane’s green decks, as per Fox.
Between 2016 and 2020, Cricket Australia experimented using the Duke ball in the second half of the Sheffield Shield season following the Big Bash to help players adapt to England’s swinging conditions, which had hurt spin ambitions – less than 15 per cent of overs were bowled with the Duke ball yielding less than 10 per cent of wickets, quoted Fox.
The rise of Murphy

“Ten months ago, Murphy was a fringe state cricketer with one first-class match to his name, struggling to crack into Victoria’s starting XI – but after a breakout summer in the Sheffield Shield, the spectacled 22-year-old has been widely touted as Lyon’s heir apparent,” Fox wrote.
“He‘s as good an off-spinner as I’ve seen since Nathan Lyon,” O’Keefe was quoted as saying by Fox. “The ball comes out of his hand beautifully, he‘s been working
on his variations. He’s going to be a star for the Sixers going forward, and also for the Australian cricket team when the time comes.
“Every year, he just seems to get a little bit better and add to that pile of new skills.”
Before Nagpur, Murphy had taken 36 first-class wickets at 23.75 since making his maiden Sheffield Shield appearance only in April 2021.

The other young tweaker in the Sheffield Shield was Sangha, who claimed 4-56 in Hambantota during last year’s Australia A tour of Sri Lanka. The leg-spinner earned his maiden national call-up in early 2021, named in Australia’s squad for a T20 tour of New Zealand at just 19. He made his first-class debut for New South Wales later that year, ending the 2021/22 Sheffield Shield season with 17 wickets at 32.17.
“He’s a competitor – he goes out there and competes, even with the bat in his hand, he competes from ball one. He doesn’t give the opposition a sniff,” Blues captain Kurtis was quoted as saying by Fox sport. “I have no doubt he’ll play a lot of cricket for Australia if he keeps on the trajectory he’s on.”

A lower back stress injury has kept Sangha, 21, out for the entire 2022/23 summer; he hasn’t played since August.
Kuhnemann, the crafty left-armer took 25 wickets at 31.88 in seven Sheffield Shield matches last summer – no spinner across the competition claimed more scalps during the 2021/22 season and then claimed 4-78 against South Africa during a warm-up match at Brisbane “rolling through the Proteas’ top order” as per Fox.

Lewis Hamilton on FIA rule: ‘Nothing will stop me from speaking’,"Hamilton said he will continue to use his global platform to promote his wide-ranging interests, which include social justice and race, human rights and protection of the LBGTQ community.","Seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton insisted he will not be silenced by offseason rules that prohibit drivers from speaking out on political issues.
Hamilton said Wednesday he will continue to use his global platform to promote his wide-ranging interests, which include social justice and race, human rights and protection of the LBGTQ community.
The FIA in December updated its International Sporting Code to require prior written permission for drivers to make or display “political, religious and personal statements or comments” during race weekends. The FIA is the governing body for Formula One.

The crackdown on free speech has been condemned by most drivers but Hamilton only weighed in for the first time Wednesday, when Mercedes revealed its 2023 car.
Hamilton said the FIA crackdown “doesn’t surprise me” but he quickly dismissed it when he learned about it over the offseason.
“Nothing will stop me from speaking on the things that I feel that I’m passionate about and issues there are,” Hamilton said. “I feel the sport does have a responsibility, still, always, to speak out as a means to create awareness on important topics, particularly as we are traveling to all these different places, so nothing changes.”
Asked if he was prepared to be penalized by the FIA for violating the new rule, Hamilton said “it would be silly to say I would want to take extra penalty points” but remained steadfast in that he won’t be silenced.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I’m still going to be speaking on my end,” Hamilton said. “We still have this platform. There’s a lot of things we need to tackle.”
Most of the drivers have spoken out against the new rule and most recently by F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, who recently told The Guardian newspaper the series would not be imposing any sort of gag. Domenicali said he expected the FIA to soon clarify its position.
Hamilton is the most vocal driver in F1 and remains the same change agent 17 years into his career as when he became the first Black winner in F1 in 2008. The British racer is now 38 years old, the winningest driver in series history and is tied with Michael Schumacher with a record seven titles.
Hamilton remains the only Black driver at the most elite level of motorsports.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hamilton often speaks out while racing in countries with questionable human rights records, or when an issue arises in which he feels his voice can lend support, which would be banned under the new FIA rule.
Hamilton last year sparred with the FIA over its crackdown of drivers wearing jewelry in the car and mocked the rule by arriving at a news conference wearing three watches, eight rings and multiple necklaces. Hamilton and the FIA had a protracted back-and-forth over the jewelry ban in which he received an extension on a deadline to remove some piercings; the two sides eventually came to an agreement.

Hamilton’s teammate George Russell is a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, which represents F1 drivers, and shared the criticism of the FIA’s attempt to limit drivers’ speech.
“I think it’s totally unnecessary in the sport and in the world we live at the moment. Naturally, we are obviously seeking clarification and I trust it will be resolved,” Russell said Wednesday.

Ravindra Jadeja: ‘I hate being called Sir. Don’t judge me. Fukre idlers make memes’,He was mocked. He wasn’t given his due. Even the praises were back-handed. Ravindra Jadeja fobs off the critics in his inimitable style,"IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja hates being called Sir Jadeja. He would rather want the world to stick to Bapu – the term of endearment bestowed on him, and others from his community, in his neck of woods. “People should call me by my name. That is enough. I hate being called Sir. If you wish, call me Bapu, that’s what I like. This Sir-Var, I don’t like at all. Actually, it just doesn’t register when people call me Sir,” Jadeja had told The Indian Express in an interaction a couple of years back, when he was returning to the team after an injury break for the England tour.
Jadeja rarely gives interviews, never-ever opens up. For years, he has maintained a rather obstinate stance towards the media. Once when out of the team, he had turned down an interview request with a half-mocking reply: “Do you think, if you write about me, I will be recalled?” But that day in 2021, before the team was to fly to England, the ‘Sir’ question had ticked off something in him. He would go on to talk about his other peeves, the angst of being judged by those who have no idea about his back story and of being repeatedly undermined by his many uninformed critics.

"Women’s World Cup: Deepti Sharma, Richa Ghosh get India past West Indies for their second successive win","Windies slump to 15th straight loss, eighth successive against India.","With four needed to win, Richa Ghosh lined up for a pull. With Shamilia Connell’s delivery not short enough for the shot, she just whacked it to the deep square-leg fence before ending up with her left leg in the air, a follow-up pose that would have made many in the Caribbean proud. For the second consecutive match, the India wicketkeeper played a gem of an innings, once again remaining unbeaten as her reputation as a finisher only grew, and with that the team’s confidence.
To be fair, the result was on expected lines. The six-wicket loss in Cape Town was West Indies 15th in a row – their longest losing streak – and their eighth successive against India. They are a team low on confidence and in a phase where they don’t know when and where their next win is going to come. They are not the team that clinched the T20 World Cup seven years ago in India. And ever since Deandra Dottin announced her shock retirement during the Commonwealth Games saying the “team environment has been non-conducive to my ability to thrive and reignite my passion,” the West Indies have been on a downward spiral.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Kotla pitch ready to test spin-wary Australians again,"After Nagpur mauling, dry, slow surface with variable bounce likely for second Test.","The yellow mower whirred into life under the Kotla sun, disturbing the siesta of the groundsmen sprawled beside a set of broken chairs in the stands.

A burly man in a light brown half-sleeved sweater would angrily bark out instructions, and soon they were engaged in a blur of brisk activities.
Then they suddenly paused, as though the siren wailed again. It was then that Australia’s coach Andrew McDonald and an army of support staff hustled onto the ground, to take one last look at the pitch, the characteristics of it dwelling in their minds ever since they landed in the country. Like a bunch of wizened sleuths desperate to unearth clues at a murder site cordoned off in yellow and black tape, they inspected the 22-yard strip with a forensic eye for detail. McDonald would lean and inspect a bare patch on the good-length area. Another moved his fingers through the brown-grass-specked spots in the middle of the surface. Then the group broke into a huddle beside the practice pitch, perhaps to discuss and analyse their findings. Then they hastily disappeared into the dressing room.

More than a decade of hiring and firing and splashing the cash has so far failed to deliver a coveted Champions League trophy for PSG’s Qatari owners.
Amid reports that the oil and gas rich Gulf state is now planning a move for Manchester United, perhaps the emir’s patience with PSG could be close to running out.

Despite all the superstar signings, a series of coaches have not managed to achieve PSG’s owners’ ultimate ambition.
When Christophe Galtier was hired last July he became the seventh coach since state-backed Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) took over the club in 2011.
With its motto “Dream Bigger” splashed on the team bus, the owners had a clear ambition to make PSG one of Europe’s leading clubs.
Yet PSG’s defeat to Bayern on Tuesday in the first leg of the round-of-16 in the Champions League was its third straight loss and fifth in 11 games, with Messi, Mbappe and Neymar all struggling for form since returning from the World Cup.

Since playmaker Javier Pastore became PSG’s first marquee signing for 42 million euros ($45 million) in 2011, the club’s net expenditure has risen to more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).
Despite this outlay, there’s been more humiliating exits than finals in Europe.
The only Champions League final PSG reached was in 2020’s pandemic-shortened format, when it also lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich as Mbappe and Neymar — who cost a combined 402 million euros ($432 million) — were held scoreless.

In 2017, PSG became the first team to be knocked out after winning the first leg 4-0 in the round of 16, losing 6-1 in the return leg at Barcelona.
In 2019, PSG became the first team to be eliminated after winning the away leg 2-0 in the round of 16, losing 3-1 at home to Manchester United.

Against Real Madrid last year, PSG was leading 2-0 on aggregate before Karim Benzema’s devastating 17-minute hat trick.
The 2020 final loss to Bayern was also symbolic because the goal scorer was winger Kingsley Coman — who left PSG when he was 18. Coman scored the winning goal again on Tuesday.
PSG’s signing of stars such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Neymar and Messi pushed homegrown forwards like Coman, Moussa Diaby and Christopher Nkunku — who all became France internationals — to leave for other clubs.
PSG’s academy had also previously failed to snap up other rising talents.

World Cup winners Thierry Henry, Paul Pogba (Juventus) and N’Golo Kanté (Chelsea) were Parisian youths but didn’t go through PSG’s academy, while Mbappé was also missed and signed from Monaco.
Hire and fire
PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi sat alongside Galtier at the coach’s unveiling and made a pledge: “We have a new era to start, a new atmosphere, new objectives.” Al-Khelaifi, however, was long seen as too close to PSG stars who were indulged while coaches had a hard time keeping their jobs.
Since QSI took over, Carlo Ancelotti is the only coach not to be fired. He left for Real Madrid in 2013.
Ancelotti was hired only after Antoine Kombouaré was moved out in December 2011 with PSG three points clear at the top of the French league. PSG lost the title to modest Montpellier by three points.

Galtier replaced Mauricio Pochettino, who had one year left on his contract and became the fourth coach in succession to be fired by PSG after Thomas Tuchel, Unai Emery and Laurent Blanc.

Pochettino, who took over in January 2021 from Tuchel, paid the price for the Madrid defeat last season.
Tuchel had been shown the door after reportedly claiming that managing PSG was like being a politician, such was the level of difficulty. Emery reportedly fell out with Neymar.
Pochettino and Blanc had signed new contracts before getting fired, exposing PSG’s impatience and apparent indifference to hefty compensation packages.
ADVERTISEMENT
Pochettino and his staff reportedly received around 10 million euros ($10.8 million). When Blanc was fired in 2016, PSG paid out 22 million euros ($23.7 million).
Fans were also angered at how long-serving captain Thiago Silva and Cavani — PSG’s all-time leading scorer with 200 goals — were encouraged to leave.
Considered too old for two-year contracts in Paris, Silva then won the Champions League with Tuchel at Chelsea and Cavani scored in the Europa League final for United in 2021.
But the Madrid defeat last year finally prompted an introspective overhaul at PSG.

Sporting director Leonardo — whose strong contacts with AC Milan made it possible to sign Ibrahimovic, Silva and European Championship-winning goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma — was fired during his second spell.
Yet problems have resurfaced under the new regime. PSG hadn’t lost three straight games since late 2011, and its five losses in 2023 are more than all of last year.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/qatars-emir-watches-as-psg-stumbles-in-champions-league-8447322/,sports
India restrict West Indies to 118/6 in Women’s T20 World Cup,"Asked to bowl, Pooja Vastrakar (1/21), opening with the new ball, gave India the early breakthrough, getting rid of the dangerous Hayley Matthew (2), striking on her very first ball.","India off-spinner Deepti Sharma spun a web around the West Indies batters to restrict them to 118 for six in their Women’s T20 World Cup Group 2 match here on Wednesday.
The seasoned Deepti (3/15) picked three wickets to become the first Indian to get to 100 T20I wickets.
Asked to bowl, Pooja Vastrakar (1/21), opening with the new ball, gave India the early breakthrough, getting rid of the dangerous Hayley Matthew (2), striking on her very first ball.
The West Indies skipper was done in by the extra bounce as Richa Ghosh completed a regulation catch.
Pooja continued to put pressure on the West Indies, bowling a wicket maiden. Shemaine Campbelle (30) hit West Indies’ first boundary in the third over, slapping a Renuka Singh (1/22) delivery past square leg.
The introduction of spin led to West Indies collecting 12 runs, including two fours from Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s over.
West Indies were 53 for 1 at the halfway mark. Campbelle and Stefanie Taylor (42) steadied the West Indies innings as they slowly but steadily stitched a 73-run partnership. The two shared nine boundaries between them.

However, twin strikes from the ever-reliable Deepti led to a mini batting collapse. The off-spinner first punished Campbelle for going for a reverse sweep with Smriti Mandhana completing a lovely catch at short third.
Three balls later, she trapped Taylor leg before which was initially deemed not out by the umpire but India successfully reviewed the decision and got it changed.
Chinelle Henry (2) was the next to go as Mandhana and Ghosh effected her run out.
India were able to stem the flow of runs but their fielding was found wanting. Deepti dropped Chedean Nation on 3 in the 16th over.

"Mercedes intent on giving Hamilton new contract, winning car",Mercedes last year had its run of eight consecutive world titles snapped and seven-time champion Hamilton went winless for the first time in his career. George Russell scored Mercedes' only victory.,"Mercedes is determined to give an energized Lewis Hamilton both a winning car and a contract extension this season.
Toto Wolff just doesn’t have a timeline for either.
Mercedes on Wednesday revealed it has returned to an all-black color scheme for this Formula One season and team principal Wolff was confident the car has improved from last year. Wolff was cautious on when the car might actually be capable of winning, but said the continued development would not be a deterrent in negotiations with Hamilton.

The struggles won’t be a deterrent in Hamilton’s contract negotiations, Wolff said.
“I don’t think it plays into Lewis’ mind any doubts that we will perform. We will. Eventually,” said Wolff, who made clear repeatedly,
“we will be competitive. We don’t know when.” Last year was difficult for Hamilton as the Mercedes design badly missed the mark. It was both uncompetitive and physically difficult to drive, and it developed a bouncing phenomenon dubbed “porpoising” that left both Hamilton and Russell bruised and battered after every drive.
Even so, Hamilton said late last season he wanted a long-term contract extension. Hamilton, who turned 38 last month, reiterated his desire to continue driving at Wednesday’s car reveal.
“I continue to love racing and that is never going to change,” Hamilton said. “It is part of my DNA and I always believe I can get better. I am planning to stay a little bit longer.” Wolff said there has been one conversation with Hamilton about a new contract but that he had neither a timeline nor an inclination to rush the process. He said neither salary nor age were of concern to Mercedes, and Wolff likened Hamilton to NFL quarterback Tom Brady, who last month retired at age 45.

“I think the age 38 plays no role for this next contract. If you look at how well top athletes in the world push boundaries, and I am thinking about Tom Brady … The age plays no role,” Wolff said. “How (Lewis) appears to me is in great form, very positive. Motivated. Energized. Maybe the best so far I’ve seen.
“He knows what he has with the team. We won eight constructors’ titles in a row … and we got it wrong last year.” The black color scheme was introduced by Mercedes in 2020 to promote diversity and inclusion in step with Hamilton’s own vocal push to increase the representation of minorities in motorsports. Mercedes returned to its traditional silver after two years, but the switch back to black is designed to cut weight from the car.
“We were overweight last year,” Wolff said. “This year we have tried to figure out where we can squeeze out every single gram.” Despite the poor performance of last year’s car, Wolff said he plans to display the Mercedes in the lobby of the Brackley headquarters as a motivating tool.

“It is a symbol of boldness for me, and courage. We took a radical design direction last year, and we dared, and we failed,” Wolff said.

“So for me, that shows a lot of the mindset of the team, how it is important to cope with success and failure at the same time.

Winning Ranji will be perfect tribute to Cheteshwar Pujara for his 100th Test: Jaydev Unadkat,"Senior India batter Pujara, who made his Test debut in 2010, is set to play his milestone 100th Test against Australia in the second match of the Border-Gavaskar series in Delhi from Friday.","Saurashtra captain Jaydev Unadkat on Wednesday said winning the Ranji Trophy title will be a “perfect tribute” for his state’s cricket icon Cheteshwar Pujara on his upcoming 100th Test appearance.
Senior India batter Pujara, who made his Test debut in 2010, is set to play his milestone 100th Test against Australia in the second match of the Border-Gavaskar series in Delhi from Friday.
“I was there when he made his Test debut, I was a part of the team as well. I don’t see a lot of difference in his attitude and ethics. There can’t be a better way to give him a tribute (than winning Ranji title),” Unadkat said on the eve of their Ranji Trophy final against Bengal beginning here on Thursday.
He said the Saurashtra trio of himself, Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja were keenly following the Ranji team while being at the national camp.

“Even during our quarters and semis, we were following it keenly together. They wished the team all the luck. Hopefully we will make them proud with the cricket we play.” Unadkat had inspired Saurashtra to the Ranji title three years back, winning against Bengal in Rajkot. This season, they have stamped their authority in white ball cricket as well, clinching the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day championships.
“Yes, we won the Vijay Hazare this year, but I feel this (Ranji title) would be a great tribute to him (Pujara), a player who has not only made Saurashtra but the nation proud. It will be the best tribute to give it to him,” said the 31-year-old pacer.
“The inspiration that he has provided not just for Saurashtra, but millions of Indian fans… To stick to the basics, to be doing what he has been doing for the last 13 years is incredible.” Saurashtra have been one of the most-improved sides in domestic cricket, making four finals in 10 seasons. Unadkat became the first bowler in the history of the tournament to take 67 wickets in their 2020 triumph.
The magic mantra of his side has been to back the teammates, Unadkat said.
“We only had three-four debutants in the last three-four years. Even if they had a lean patch we backed them, we had the belief. Credit goes to the guys. After I took up the captaincy in 2017-18 we had no fear of failure.

“This team is very close to my heart. When you start playing, you always dream of playing Ranji Trophy. That was my dream to play for Saurashtra. To play for the nation comes secondary, first you have to establish yourself as a Ranji Trophy player. That dream still lives strong.” Unadkat said he still feels jittery and excited every time he goes out to play for Saurashtra.
“The fact that I’m able to build a team that everyone recognises as a formidable force in the domestic circuit, itself is a matter of pride.
“Any final that I play with this bunch of players is going to be special. We have been playing together for a decade now, we have a great bonding. I look forward to it every season.” Unadkat, who was part of the India Test side for the ongoing home series against Australia, made a special request to be “released” for the Ranji final.

“I was keen to get game time and the team management were equally keen. (Head coach) Rahul (Dravid) bhai wanted me to go out there and play, it was a mutual decision.” Was it a difficult choice to prefer playing for state to country? “Playing a Ranji final in itself is a dream.

Billionaire Jahm Najafi set to launch $3.75bn takeover bid for Spurs – Source,"The report said that the Najafi and MSP-led offer would value Tottenham, who are fifth in the Premier League, at approximately $3 billion before adding about $750 million of debt on the club's books.","Iranian-American billionaire Jahm Najafi, chair of MSP Sports Capital, is set to launch a $3.75 billion takeover bid for Premier League soccer club Tottenham Hotspur, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Tottenham declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Earlier, the Financial Times reported MSP Sports Capital is working with a consortium of investors to structure the bid and that it is weeks away from formally approaching the club’s owner Joe Lewis and chair Daniel Levy.
The report said that the Najafi and MSP-led offer would value Tottenham, who are fifth in the Premier League, at approximately $3 billion before adding about $750 million of debt on the club’s books. It added that MSP and its partners will put forward 70% of the purchase price, while backers from the Gulf, mainly from Abu Dhabi, will contribute the rest 30%.
Najafi is also a minority shareholder in the National Basketball Association team Phoenix Suns. Tottenham, currently managed by Antonio Conte, have 39 points after 23 games in the league this season and sit two points outside the top four.
The north London club last won a trophy in 2008 when they lifted the League Cup.

Ukrainian Olympic head on Russian rival: ‘He is my enemy’,"Guttsait, who is also Ukraine's sports minister as well as its Olympic committee president, now has only contempt for his former teammate. Guttsait calls Pozdnyakov “my enemy"" and says their friendship began to collapse when Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014.","They fought on the same side and together won Olympic gold, young men from Russia and a newly independent Ukraine, joined for one last medal-winning hurrah on a short-lived post-Soviet Unified Team at the 1992 Barcelona Games.
Now, former fencers Vadym Guttsait and Stanislav Pozdnyakov are on opposite sides of the war that Russia is waging on Ukraine. Both have risen to become senior sports administrators, respectively heading the Ukrainian and Russian Olympic committees. The nearly year-old invasion has utterly shredded what was left of their friendship and they’re now fighting each other in a divisive and growing split within the Olympic movement over whether Russia and ally Belarus should be barred from next year’s Paris Games.
Guttsait, who is also Ukraine’s sports minister as well as its Olympic committee president, now has only contempt for his former teammate. Guttsait calls Pozdnyakov “my enemy” and says their friendship began to collapse when Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Moscow’s full-scale invasion, which enters its second year next week, was the last straw. Guttsait blames the Russian Olympic Committee president for making supportive comments of the assault.
“I don’t want to talk to him. I don’t want to know him at all. He is my enemy, who supports this war, who considers it an honor for athletes to take part in the war against Ukrainians, to kill Ukrainians,” Guttsait said. “Therefore, for today and forever, this person does not exist for me.”
The issue of whether athletes from Russia and Belarus should be allowed to compete is shaping up as the biggest potential spoiler of next year’s Paris Olympics. Guttsait is threatening a Ukrainian boycott if Russians and Belarusians are there and he is mobilizing support from other countries, backed by the wartime star power of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Russia and Belarus, on the other hand, are clinging to a lifeline thrown to them by the International Olympic Committee, which says some of their athletes may be able to return to international competition despite the war. The IOC suggests that their athletes who have not actively supported the war could try to qualify and compete as “neutral athletes,” stripped of national team uniforms, flags and anthems. Pozdnyakov has said Russia is preparing as if its athletes are going to Paris.
In an interview late Tuesday with The Associated Press, Guttsait laid out the process that could lead to a Ukrainian boycott of Paris if that happens. The minister said his own personal opinion is that “we need to boycott” if Russians and Belarusians attend. But he added that the decision isn’t his alone to make and said the Ukrainian Olympic Committee will convene an extraordinary meeting and “we will decide together whether we will participate or not.”

“This is a very important question, it is a very serious question and difficult for every athlete, for every coach who prepares all his life to go to the Olympic Games,” he said. “But while our people are dying, women and children are being killed, our cities are being destroyed, we stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. In my opinion, this is more important than going to the competition. But we need to make this political decision together with our Olympic family.”
Before any decision for a full boycott, Ukrainian athletes could also show opposition by withdrawing from Olympic qualifying competitions that allow Russian and Belarusian entrants. Guttsait cited the example of the European wrestling championships in Croatia in April. If Russian and Belarusian athletes compete, Ukrainian wrestlers will either not attend “or they will come and not take part,” Guttsait said.
International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach is facing a widespread backlash from Ukraine and its allies for opening a door for some athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to international competition. Bach argues that the Olympic movement has a “unifying mission of bringing people together” and a proven track record of opening lines of communication between nations divided by conflict. He cites the example of North and South Korea, which fielded a joint women’s hockey team at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Guttsait noted, however, that there are also Olympic precedents for keeping nations out. Germany and Japan were not invited to the 1948 London Olympics after they were the aggressors in World War II and South Africa was excluded from 1964-1988 because of its racist Apartheid laws.

The minister said support among Russian athletes for the invasion makes their presence at the Paris Olympics unthinkable while the war rages. He also noted that Russian athletes are often enrolled in the country’s armed forces.
Ukrainian athletes, on the other hand, are facing the miseries of war as they try, as best they can, to ready themselves for Paris.

"‘I did my best, if someone’s doing better than that, it’s fine’: Shikhar Dhawan","One of the finest openers India have produced in the 50-over format, Dhawan was dropped from the side following a lean run which included the three games in Bangladesh in December.","Shikhar Dhawan finds himself out of the Indian team less than three months after captaining the ODI side but the 37-year-old opener has not yet given up on a strong desire to play the World Cup at home later this year.
One of the finest openers India have produced in the 50-over format, Dhawan was dropped from the side following a lean run which included the three games in Bangladesh in December. The southpaw had led the side in New Zealand in November when Rohit Sharma and K L Rahul were rested.
Shubman Gill came into the team at Dhawan’s expense and the young opener has not looked back ever since, amassing four hundreds, including a double hundred in his last seven innings.
Speaking to PTI on the sidelines of the inaugural Formula E race in India, the ever optimistic Dhawan looked back at ups and downs of the last three months.
“They (ups and downs) are part of life. With time, with experience you learn how to handle them with ease. I find lot of strength in them. I did my best. If somebody is doing better than my best, that is fine.
“That is why that person is there and I am not there. I am very happy and content wherever I am. I make sure my process goes on strong. Of course there is always a chance of me coming back to the side.
“If it comes it is good, if it doesn’t come that is also good. I have achieved a lot and I am happy with that. Whatever has to come will come. I don’t get desperate about it,” said Dhawan, who has played 34 Tests, 167 ODIs and 68 T20s.

With his last Test coming in 2018 and T20 International in 2021, Dhawan had become a one-format player until his exclusion from the ODI set up. His immediate focus is on the upcoming IPL in which he will be captaining Punjab Kings for the first time.
Dhawan has returned from a 10-day training stint at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. In another week’s time, he will be in Mohali for a pre-IPL camp with Punjab Kings.
“My IPL preparation is going on well. I was in Bangalore for 10 days. The focus was on fitness. With the IPL coming up, I will join the camp in Mohali from Feburary 24 and then we regroup again later on and get going.
“I am in a very good state of mind and looking forward to leading from the front,” he said.

During the Fomrula E weekend in Hyderabad, Dhawan also got to catch up with the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, whose passion for cars and motorsport is well-known.
Talking about his first time at a Formula E race, he added: “It is always lovely to meet Sachin paaji. He has got great passion towards sports cars.

Mitchell Starc optimistic on chances of playing in second test against India,"The tourists lost by an innings and 132 runs inside three days on a slow wicket in Nagpur and parachuted left-armer Starc into the squad ahead of the second test, which begins in New Delhi on Friday.","Australian paceman Mitchell Starc is optimistic on his chances of returning to the side for the second test against India despite the lingering effects of a finger injury that kept him out of the defeat in last week’s series opener.
The tourists lost by an innings and 132 runs inside three days on a slow wicket in Nagpur and parachuted left-armer Starc into the squad ahead of the second test, which begins in New Delhi on Friday.
“I’d like to be a little further down the road,” said Starc, who sustained the injury fielding against South Africa in December.
“Still a good chance of playing. It’ll come down to how it reacts by the end of the day, how the medical staff see it, how the selectors, skipper Pat Cummins and Ronnie (coach Andrew McDonald) feel about it.
“I’ll do everything I can to be available for selection.”
Starc told reporters he planned to bowl “as normal” but his finger was still lacking strength after being in a splint for weeks. The 33-year-old said that batting would be uncomfortable and he would wear a protective cap on his finger while fielding.
Starc may be one of only two fast bowlers in the side if all-rounder Cameron Green – also recovering from a finger injury – is fit to play, allowing the tourists to deploy three spinners.

"Ashwin rises to 2nd spot in ICC Test bowlers rankings, Jadeja makes significant gains",The spin duo haunted Australia in the first Test between by sharing 15 wickets between them as India won by an innings 132 runs inside three days.,"India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin on Wednesday jumped to the second spot in the ICC Men’s Test Bowlers Rankings following his eight-wicket show against Australia in the opening Test in Nagpur.
Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who made a successful comeback after almost five months due to a knee injury, has moved up to the 16th position, courtesy his player-of-the-match winning effort in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series-opener.
The spin duo haunted Australia in the first Test between by sharing 15 wickets between them as India won by an innings 132 runs inside three days.

Ashwin ensured India wrapped up a stunning victory before tea on the third day, as the veteran off-spinner took 5/37 in the second innings to go with 3/42 earlier in the match.
The 36-year-old is 21 rating points behind Australia captain Pat Cummins and is contention to return to the No.1 ranking for the first time since 2017.
While Ashwin stepped up in what turned out to be the last session of the Test, Jadeja did the damage on the first day with 5/47, including the prized wickets of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne.
Jadeja then took 2/34 in the second Australian innings. Australia were bowled out for just 91.
Among other Indian bowlers, pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who too has been out of action since September last due to a lower back stress fracture, is placed fifth.

In the Test batting chart, India captain Rohit Sharma has been rewarded for his match-defining ton in Nagpur. He gained two spots to be at number eight.
Rohit came to the crease after Australia were all out for 177 in their first innings, then made the wicket look all-but tame with an assured 120 that set the tone for the rest of the match.
Wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant, who will be out of action for an indefinite period following his horrific car accident, is the other Indian batter in top-10. He is placed seventh.
In contrast Australian openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja have paid the price for being dismissed cheaply twice.

Warner has fallen six places to 20th after his scores of 1 and 10, while Khawaja has dropped two spots to 10th after only making 1 and 5 in the first Test.
Australian duo of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith occupy the top two position with Pakistan captain Babar Azam in the third spot.
India all-rounder Axar Patel has leaped six places to seventh in Test all-rounder rankings after coming to the crease at a tense 240 for 7. He hit a patient 84 for his highest score in the format.

“I’m not going to pin myself against Ash. I think the way Ashwin has gone about it has been remarkable and his record speaks for himself,” Lyon told Star Sports.

England captain Ben Stokes hopes counties take up ‘Bazball’ mantle,"The England Lions, the country's second-tier team, have taken up the mantle, with Jamie Smith smashing 126 from 82 balls in the first innings of the second unofficial test against Sri Lanka 'A' last week.","Ben Stokes hopes the ‘Bazball’ revolution that has shaken up test cricket and led an English resurgence can also fire up the domestic county game.
England have won nine of their last 10 tests since captain Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum took charge last year and imbued the team’s batsmen with an attacking mindset.
The England Lions, the country’s second-tier team, have taken up the mantle, with Jamie Smith smashing 126 from 82 balls in the first innings of the second unofficial test against Sri Lanka ‘A’ last week.

Opener Alex Lees, who was dropped from Stokes’s England last year after struggling for runs, scored 97 from 113 balls in the same innings for the Lions in another knock straight out of the ‘Bazball’ playbook.
Stokes said Lees had brought “the message” from the test team to the Lions and they had responded accordingly.
“It’s obviously shown. You look at the way that the lads have gone about (it), in particular with the bat,” Stokes told reporters on Wednesday, on the eve of the first test against New Zealand.
“You can see they’re really pressing the game forward.

“It’s great to see it filtering down from us up here at the top down the Lions and hopefully into county cricket as well.”
England were in a wretched place less than a year ago in the wake of a heavy Ashes defeat and a series loss away to the West Indies but they are now a picture of vitality in batting and bowling.
The sustained quality of pace stalwarts James Anderson and Stuart Broad has seen both join Ollie Robinson in the 11 for the pink ball series-opener against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui.
That has meant no place for the squad’s other fast bowlers Olly Stone and Matthew Potts.

Stokes told British media on Tuesday he had asked his medical team to give him eight fit fast bowlers to choose from in a big year for his captaincy.

India vs Australia: Ajay Jadeja compares Axar Patel to Rohit Sharma,Axar Patel’s first innings partnership alongside Ravindra Jadeja for the eighth wicket pushed India’s lead past 200 runs and helped the home team dictate terms going into the second innings of the Nagpur Test match.,"In the first Test at Nagpur, India’s crucial first innings lead was built up by a partnership between Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, both of whom scored fifties and ensured that India’s lead would go up by 200 runs. The 88-run partnership for the eighth wicket was compared to a Rohit Sharma innings by former Indian cricketer Ajay Jadeja.
“The wicket was not easy to bat on. The calmness, composure and solidarity displayed by Rohit Sharma was seen in Axar Patel too. He batted as if there were no demons on this wicket,” Jadeja said on Cricbuzz. Patel missed out on what could have been a well-earned century, but his knock drove the wedge between India and Australia – a wedge that was taken advantage of by Ravichandran Ashwin, who cleaned up the Aussie batting lineup with a five-wicket haul in the second innings.
Jadeja also spoke about how he rated Axar higher than Ravindra Jadeja on the basis that Axar’s improvement on his batting took place over the course of four Test matches, while Ravindra Jadeja’s took some more time to get to the stage where he is at today.
“He is one of those players who rises to the occasion – when the opportunity provides or when the team is in trouble or when all eyes are on him – and takes his game to a whole different level. I have heard things about him such as he is very casual, but someone who enjoys his game. But he improves when needed,” said Jadeja.

He then added, “If Ravindra [Jadeja] has taken 30 Test matches to improve his batting, he has taken just 4 I guess. He is performing his primary role of a bowler with aplomb but in batting too he has made rapid strides. If I have to rate all three all-rounders, then I will place Axar on top.”

"Chess: On the day Sara Khadem met Spanish Prime Minister, an arrest warrant was issued against her in Iran",Iran Grandmaster Khadem defects to Spain after being exiled for not wearing headscarf at a tournament,"Iranian Woman Grandmaster Sarasadat Khademalsharieh, better known as Sara Khadem, competed in a tournament without a hijab and subsequently decided not to return home but defect to Spain.
Trouble awaits her if she tries to return to Iran – there are arrest papers waiting for her.
Khadem, ranked 17th in the world (among women), refused to wear a hijab as she competed in the world rapid and blitz championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan from December 26-30.
She finished tied 31st in the rapid competition and 19th in blitz, in which players must make their moves even faster.
Fearing trouble for her action, Khadem defected to Spain where she now lives in exile with her husband and one-year-old son.
The hijab, which is mandatory under Iran’s strict Islamic dress code, has become the focus of protests against the Iranian government.
Khadem not wearing the hijab was seen as being in solidarity with demonstrations that brought unrest in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini. The 22-year-old died in custody in September after being arrested by Iran’s morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab correctly.
ADVERTISEMENT
Khadem is not the first Iranian women’s Grandmaster to defect to another country. In fact, all the other four active Iranian women’s Grandmasters have also defected to other countries. Dorsa Derakhshani defected in 2017. Atousa Pourkashiyan, like Derakhshani, plays for the USA. Ghazal Hakimifard has moved to Switzerland while Mitra Hejazipour plays for France.
Khadem has been outspoken in the past. In 2019, when Grandmaster Alireza Firouzja protested and defected to France, upset at being forced to lose by default against Israeli rivals — the Iran government had a policy of its players not playing with Israeli opponents — Khadem had supported Firouzja and warned that if the decision wasn’t overturned, more players would follow Firouzja and find asylum somewhere else.
Married to popular Iranian film director Ardeshir Ahmadi, who was once imprisoned in Iran for three months, apparently because of documentaries he had made, Khadem, anticipating trouble if she goes back to Iran, headed to a Spanish city with her husband and her 11-month-old baby.

She has been able to stay in Spain because of the golden visa rule, which allows anyone who buys a property valued at half a million euros (£442,000; $536,000) to gain residency.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez invited Sara Khadem to meet him. The day — January 25 — turned out to be bittersweet.

Kuggeleijn was recalled to the New Zealand team after Kyle Jamieson was also ruled out due to injury. Kuggeleijn was arrested in 2015 and charged with rape. The jury attempted to convict him twice during the case, failing to reach a verdict the first time. His lawyer managed to successfully appeal to the court that ‘reluctant consent’ was provided – even though the victim claimed that her arms were pinned and she was told to be quiet as she was crying.

Australia cruises past Bangladesh at Women’s T20 World Cup,Australia joined Sri Lanka with two wins from two in Group 1 and went back to the top on net run rate.,"Australia legspinner Georgia Wareham made the most of her first international match in more than a year, taking 3-20 as the defending champions eased to victory over Bangladesh by eight wickets at the Women’s T20 World Cup on Tuesday.
Australia joined Sri Lanka with two wins from two in Group 1 and went back to the top on net run rate.
Wareham, whose last international was in October 2021, was pivotal as Australia limited Bangladesh to 107-7, where only captain Nigar Sultana’s 57 from 50 balls stood out.
What an innings from the Bangladesh captain!

The Aussies were untroubled in their chase, cruising to 111-2 in 18.2 overs and led home by captain Meg Lanning, who barely got out of second gear in her 48 not out.
Opener Alyssa Healy hit 37 from 36 at the top to put the world’s top-ranked team on the way to another impressive win. Australia beat New Zealand by a whopping 97 runs in the first game of its title defense.
Australia is the dominant force in women’s cricket and has won five of the seven T20 World Cups and is seeking a third straight title.
Wareham had a long road back to international cricket after rupturing a ligament in her left knee more than a year ago.
On her comeback, the 23-year-old spinner picked up the wickets of Sobhana Mostary (7), Shorna Akter (12) and Rumana Ahmed (4) in Bangladesh’s middle order as Australia took control and never relinquished it in the first game of the World Cup in Gqeberha, the city formerly known as Port Elizabeth.

India is back in action Wednesday against West Indies and could join England with two wins from two in Group 2.
India is also expected to be boosted by the return of star batter Smriti Mandhana, who is set to come back into the team after missing the opening win over Pakistan with a finger injury.
Mandhana is likely to be in good spirits after she was the most expensive player to be bought at the Women’s Premier League auction in India on Monday.

Tiger Woods returns to golf with the same belief he can win,"Woods is well aware that he has not won since October 2019, and that at age 47 and with more surgeries than major titles (15), time is running out. He knows that. He's just not quite ready to accept it.","Tiger Woods feels good enough to play at Riviera, his first tournament with a cut and without a cart since the British Open last July. He already is looking ahead to the Masters. And yes, he thinks he can win.
“I would not have put myself out here if I didn’t think I could beat these guys,” Woods said Tuesday ahead of the Genesis Invitational, which has attracted 19 of the top 20 players in the world.
He also is well aware that he has not won since October 2019, and that at age 47 and with more surgeries than major titles (15), time is running out. He knows that. He’s just not quite ready to accept it.
He marvels at how long Tom Brady lasted. He remembers when John Elway retired from the Denver Broncos because his body could no longer recover the way it once did. Golf is not a contact sport, but it has become a young man’s game. Only two of the top 10 players in golf are in their 30s. The oldest is Rory McIlroy at 33.
Woods can play. The question is whether he can compete, whether he can win. He remains at 82 career PGA Tour titles, a record he shares with Sam Snead, who was 67 when he made the cut at a PGA Championship.
Part of Woods was annoyed that he was celebrated for making the cut in the Masters last year, his first competition since a February 2021 car crash outside Los Angeles shattered bones in his right leg and ankle.
“I’m there to get a W, OK? So I don’t understand that making the cut is a great thing,” Woods said. “If I entered the event, it’s always to get a W. There will come a point in time when my body will not allow me to do that anymore, and it’s probably sooner rather than later. But wrapping my ahead around that transition and being the ambassador role and just trying to be out here with the guys, no, that’s not in my DNA.”
ADVERTISEMENT
He played that ambassador role last year at the Genesis Invitational as the tournament host. He also is leading the private player meetings geared toward building a new PGA Tour model of elite tournaments as a response to Saudi-funded LIV Golf.
His announcement Friday that he was playing led to a scramble for media credentials. The back of the press room in the Riviera clubhouse was lined with some two dozen photographers waiting for him to show up for his news conference.
Justin Rose watched in December as Woods played with his son at the PNC Championship, riding in a cart. Woods has been saying he can hit all the shots, that it’s walking to them that makes it difficult.
“In terms of the important part of can you hit a golf ball, can you get a ball in the hole, all of that seemed to be really in order,” Rose said. “But we know that’s definitely not the thing he struggles with, right? It’s obviously the physical side of putting together four rounds of golf. (It’s) a really good sign to see him in the field and feeling willing and able to get out here.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Woods had planned to play in his Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas the first week of December, but in accelerating his practice he developed plantar fasciitis that kept him from walking. He said he still copes with plantar fasciitis, only it has become manageable. The ankle is what gives him problems.
He prepared for Riviera — and the Masters, and whatever else can follow — with a more graduated practice of hitting golf balls, walking the course until he became tired, and then walking a little more until he could get in 18 holes.
What to expect? Not even Woods knows.
Expectations have run the gamut during his incomparable career. He once went two whole months in 2001 without winning, and the cover of a golf magazine said, “What’s wrong with Tiger?” He went on to win his next three starts, including the Masters.
Now it’s whether he’s kidding himself about winning.
ADVERTISEMENT
Woods no longer is motivated by naysayers, a product of age and maturity, with a dose of reality. He knows his last win was the Zozo Championship in Japan in 2019, which was six months after he won the Masters.
Before his back fusion surgery in 2017, when it was a struggle just to walk, Woods had reason to wonder if he would ever play. He thinks he can beat McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler, the new No. 1 in golf. But there is more gratitude about simply playing.
“Those back operations were tough,” he said. “That proved to myself more than anything that I could still do it. … Ultimately, it’s within me and whether or not I believe I can do it. It’s not the motivating factor of outside.”
As for the rest of the year, Woods only knows it will be a limited schedule of the majors and maybe a few more. That’s a good forecast. He was at Los Angeles Country Club on Monday riding around in a cart to look at the North course ahead of the U.S. Open.

Bazball goes home as England take on Kiwis in New Zealand,McCullum devised the eponymous strategy of all out attack during his highly-successful term as New Zealand captain when he used it to upend the Black Caps’ traditional conservative approach and underdog mindset.,"England cricket coach Brendon McCullum will bring Bazball back to its birthplace in a two-test series against New Zealand which begins Thursday in Mount Maunganui.
McCullum devised the eponymous strategy of all out attack during his highly-successful term as New Zealand captain when he used it to upend the Black Caps’ traditional conservative approach and underdog mindset.
The policy, which hadn’t yet been named for “Baz” McCullum, largely reflected his own nature as one of the sport’s most attacking batters and his approach to life as a natural bon vivant. McCullum figured if somebody was going to play cricket, it should be fun.

“In any job you do you want to have fun, or else what’s the point in doing it?” he said. “We get one crack at life. If you’ve got some skills, aspirations and dreams why would you not live those out and have a smile on your face?”
Bazball has flourished since McCullum transplanted it in England among a team of kindred spirits, willing to risk losing in order to chase a win. England was down on its luck when McCullum became coach but now has won nine of its last 10 test matches.
McCullum now can display his refined version of Bazball to a New Zealand audience which saw it in its infancy. The move to the pink ball format on Thursday hasn’t pleased all members of the England team: fast bowler Ollie Robinson who is coming to grips with the pink Kookaburra ball called it “gimmicky,”
“They’re trying to get crowds in and change the game a little bit,” Robinson said. “But the way England are playing test cricket at the moment, I don’t think that needs to happen. We could stick to how we’re going and we’re entertaining people as we are so I’m not sure if it’s necessary really.”
Preparations for both teams have been affected by Cyclone Gabrielle which ravaged Auckland and New Zealand’s northern region and east coast, leading to the announcement of national state of emergency. The storm brought heavy rain and wind to the Mount Maunganui area, forcing teams to practice indoors.

New Zealand-born Ben Stokes who leads England is very much McCullum’s protege in the Bazball era and will again pursue an attacking strategy in the coming series. England has lost five of its six previous pink ball tests but Stokes is confident of a positive result from Thursday, weather permitting.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I’m sure we’ll still come up with a way to hopefully force a result regardless of how much time is taken away (by weather),” Stokes said.
McCullum has kept England’s preparation relatively light, spending the first few days of the tour in the South Island resort of Queenstown and taking the team to the races on Saturday to see his horse, Defibrilate, run in a Group One race at Te Rapa. It was among the favorites but finished fourth.
New Zealand’s preparation has been troubled, made so by bad backs and babies and by travel disruptions which delayed the arrival in Mount Maunganui of some players. The fast bowlers Kyle Jamieson and Matt Henry both are out of the match, Jamieson because of a back injury and Henry because of the birth of his first child.
Two uncapped players, Jacob Duffy and Scott Kuggeleijn, have been called in as replacements as the New Zealand selectors elected not to call up the uncontracted Trent Boult, who lives close by and is available.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s been decided since he gave up his contract that we would give priority to contracted players,” New Zealand coach Gary Stead said. “We discussed it internally but our decision was not to go with Trent on this occasion.”
England has named the 36-year-old swing bowler Stuart Broad in its match XI for his first first-class match since September. He joins James Anderson and Robinson in the pace attack.
As Gabrielle heads away to the east, the prospect of a major weather disruption eases. A few showers may fall on day one but the rest of the test should be played in sunny and warm conditions.

Kylian Mbappe believes PSG can beat Bayern in return leg,"The France forward came on as a substitute in the 57th minute and ignited the game, having two goals disallowed for offside as his entrance changed the storyline of the match.","Kylian Mbappe said he was confident Paris St Germain could advance into the quarter-finals of the Champions League despite losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in the first leg of their last-16 clash on Tuesday.
The France forward came on as a substitute in the 57th minute and ignited the game, having two goals disallowed for offside as his entrance changed the storyline of the match.
“We have to remember the final part of the game; we’re behind but we saw that we were able to cause them trouble. We need all our players to be healthy and go there to win and qualify,” said Mbappe, who was back after a two-week injury layoff.
Mbappe’s return to fitness is PSG’s best hope looking ahead to the March 8 second leg at the Allianz Arena.
“I was not supposed to play but I wanted to help my mates, bring some energy. We tried everything. Today I couldn’t do more,” he said.
Mbappe believes that if PSG are at full strength they can turn things around in Munich.
“It’s important that all our players are healthy, that everyone eats well, sleeps well,” he said.

“We saw that when we are all together we are able to play forward, to play attacking football and that they were not comfortable.”
Coach Christophe Galtier will also hope that Achraf Hakimi will be back on the right flank of the defence after he was replaced because of injury at halftime.

Sourav Ganguly had told Virat Kohli to ‘think about it once’ before quitting T20 captaincy: Chief selector Chetan Sharma in sting video,"Chairman of the senior selection committee Chetan Sharma also said that there is no battle between Kohli and Rohit Sharma, but there is ego and compared the rivalry to yesteryear heroes Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra.","Chairman of the senior selection committee of men’s cricket Chetan Sharma was the subject of a sting operation during which he said that former India captain Virat Kohli tried to defame the then BCCI president Sourav Ganguly because he felt the latter was responsible for him losing his ODI captaincy.
In September 2021, Virat Kohli announced his decision to step down as T20 captain after the T20 World Cup in Dubai following which the BCCI stripped him of ODI captaincy in December. The BCCI named Rohit Sharma as the white-ball captain.
Ganguly said that he had asked Kohli not to step down as T20 captain because two-white ball leaders were not ideal.
However, Kohli contradicted Ganguly and said that his decision to give up T20 captaincy was termed as ‘progressive’ by the BCCI when he had informed them of the same. Kohli also said in the pre-departure press conference, ahead of the South Africa tour, that he had been told about his removal as ODI captain just 90 minutes before the selection meeting to pick the Test squad for South Africa.
In the sting operation done by Zee News, Chetan Sharma said that Kohli was told by Ganguly to ‘think once’ before giving up T20I captaincy but the star Indian batsman might have not heard it during video conference.
“Virat Kohli felt he lost the captaincy because of the BCCI President. There were nine people in the selection committee video conference, Ganguly told him ‘think about it once’. I think Kohli didn’t hear it, there were nine others there including myself and all other selectors, BCCI officials,” Sharma was heard saying in the video.
Sharma also said that he felt that there was an ego clash between Ganguly and Kohli. “Two egos clashing, one who is thinking that Ganguly has removed me from the captaincy, so I will teach him a lesson. He (Virat) gave a statement that Ganguly is doing this, basically to defame him. He (Virat) tried to tell this in the media… which backfired on him (Virat),” Chetan Sharma was heard saying in the video.
ADVERTISEMENT
On December 9, 2021, former India captain Ganguly had said: “We (BCCI) had requested Virat not to step down as T20I captain. There was no plan to change captaincy. But he stepped down as T20I captain and the selectors decided not to split limited-overs captaincy, opting for a complete separation.”
Referring to the BCCI’s decision to hand the reins of the T20I and ODI captaincy to Rohit Sharma, Ganguly had said: “Bottom line is that there can’t be two white-ball captains.”
However, a week later, Kohli during a press conference contradicted Ganguly’s claim.
He had then said, “Before quitting the T20I captaincy, I had approached the BCCI and explained the reasons behind my decision. That was received very well. There was no offence or hesitation. I wasn’t told not to relinquish the T20 captaincy. Rather, it was taken as a progressive step, in the right direction. I communicated at that time that I would like to continue as Test and ODI captain unless the office-bearers and the selectors felt that I shouldn’t carry on with this responsibility. My communication (to the BCCI) was clear,” Kohli had said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Chetan Sharma added in the sting video, “This is the dispute of the ego. He (Virat) says I am big .He (Ganguly) says I am big. Sourav Ganguly has also been the captain of the country. Very big captain, most trustworthy and he is called the most successful captain even today. Virat feels that he is the most successful.. He (Virat) said he (Ganguly) is lying then there was a confrontation.”
The chairman of selectors was also asked whether there was a rift between Kohli and Sharma.
“There is no battle between Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma but there is ego. Both are like big film stars, you can say, Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra,” he added.
Sharma also revealed how players take injections to fake (clear) their fitness test and also added that current T20 captain Hardik Pandya comes to his place to speak to him often about his future.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sourav-ganguly-virat-kohli-t20-captaincy-india-chetan-sharma-chief-selector-sting-video-8445366/,sports
Mikel Arteta says Arsenal angry ahead of Manchester City clash,Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Brentford means leaders Arsenal are only three points ahead of champions City and could be knocked off the top if they lose at The Emirates.,"Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta says there is ‘huge anger’ amongst his players ahead of Wednesday’s vital clash with Manchester City after a VAR mistake cost his side two points in the title race at the weekend.
Saturday’s 1-1 draw at home to Brentford means leaders Arsenal are only three points ahead of champions City and could be knocked off the top if they lose at The Emirates.
Brentford’s equaliser scored by Ivan Toney stood despite his team mate Christian Norgaard being in an offside position in the build-up, a mistake acknowledged by Professional Game Match Officials Limited as a ‘significant error’.

Lee Mason, the VAR official for the game, has since been stood down for his mistake in which he failed to draw the lines usually used to judge offside decisions.
While Arteta is pleased that the club have received an apology, he said only having two more points added to their total would compensate for the error.
“We ended the game with a huge anger because that wasn’t a human error, that was a big not understanding your job and that’s not acceptable,” Arteta, whose side have stumbled in their last two matches, told reporters on Tuesday.
“That costs Arsenal two points. We appreciate the apology and the explanation at the same time.
“I will only be satisfied if they give me the two points back which is not going to be the case.”
Arteta said Arsenal would use the sense of injustice to fire then up against Pep Guardiola’s City.

"FIFA targets 2030 World Cup host vote in September next year, Club World Cup 2023 to take place in Saudi Arabia",The Saudi-hosted Club World Cup in December should be the last in the current seven-team format of continental champions plus the host nation’s domestic league winner.,"The 2030 World Cup hosts are expected to be picked in September next year, FIFA said Tuesday.
FIFA’s ruling council confirmed a timetable for bidding and a vote to be held in the third quarter of next year by around 200 member federations. FIFA has long targeted a decision in 2024 for the tournament that is currently scheduled to have 48 teams.
A separate election meeting will be held earlier in 2024 to pick a host for the 2027 Women’s World Cup, soccer’s governing body said.
The three 2026 hosts of the men’s World Cup — the United States, Canada and Mexico — all had their expected automatic entries in the 48-team finals tournament confirmed Tuesday. It will be the first edition expanded from the 32-team tournament that was introduced in 1998.
FIFA also picked Saudi Arabia — a potential candidate in the 2030 contest — to host the next Club World Cup from Dec. 12-22 in the latest addition to the kingdom’s sports hosting ambitions.
In the 2030 hosting race, co-hosting bids from South America and Europe have been the expected favorites, with Morocco also in the picture and speculation about a Saudi-led and unprecedented three-continent project.
The inaugural 1930 World Cup host, Uruguay, is part of a centenary bid with Argentina, Chile and Paraguay.

Spain and Portugal were joined last October for their longstanding European candidacy by Ukraine.
Morocco committed to taking part in the 2030 contest more than four years ago immediately after losing the vote for the 2026 tournament to the North Americans.
At the World Cup in Qatar in December, Moroccan soccer federation leader Fouzi Lekjaa was still open to reviving an old idea of Morocco joining its near-neighbors Spain and Portugal in an intercontinental bid.
Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to host more soccer events have led to unconfirmed speculation of a 2030 bid with Egypt in Africa and Greece in Europe. It is unclear how European soccer body UEFA would deal with a member federation joining a rival bid.

Such a bid also would require sending the tournament back to Asia and the Persian Gulf only eight years after Qatar hosted, so a Saudi bid for 2034 could be more realistic.
The Saudi-hosted Club World Cup in December should be the last in the current seven-team format of continental champions plus the host nation’s domestic league winner.
FIFA has set a June 2025 target to launch a tournament of 32 teams with European teams taking 12 entries.
Continental allocations for the tournament were confirmed Tuesday with South America to get six teams, and four each going to Asia, Africa and the CONCACAF region, plus one to Oceania. The host nation will get the last slot.

IND vs AUS: KL Rahul deserves more chances as an opener before an in-form Shubman Gill takes his place,"IND vs AUS: KL Rahul is the only Indian opener to have scored centuries in South Africa, England and Australia; if Virat Kohli could be given time, and in the past, everyone from Tendulkar to Dravid, Laxman to Sehwag, too were given time to rediscover their touch, so could KL Rahul.","IND vs AUS: A frown replaced KL Rahul’s smile. He was batting without fuss in Nagpur for his 20 before a moment of misjudgment ended his stay. He stared heartbreakingly at the rough from where the ball had leapt. For he knew that another failure would raise the volume of criticism against him. Since his last hundred — an attritional 123 against Kagiso Rabada and Co in Centurion, when no other batsman of either side managed half as many runs in the entire Test, runs have dried up.
In 10 innings since, he had hoarded only 180 runs, and combined with middling returns in white-ball formats, his spot has been subject to incessant scrutiny. Not least because he has displaced the brightest young batting talent in the country, arguably in the world, who in two weeks had peeled out hundreds in all formats.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-versus-australia-kl-rahul-deserves-more-chances-as-an-opener-before-shubman-gill-takes-his-place-8445293/,sports
Tiwary hails DRS introduction in Ranji Trophy final,"""It's good news that it's (DRS) being implemented in the final. I feel it should be there in all matches that are being telecast live,"" Tiwary said on Tuesday.","Bengal skipper Manoj Tiwary on Tuesday hailed the inclusion of DRS for their Ranji Trophy final against Saurashtra from Thursday at the Eden Gardens.
This is the first time DRS will be implemented in a Ranji Trophy final and both teams will get three reviews in each innings. This comes after last season’s final between Madhya Pradesh and Mumbai was mired in controversy.
“It’s good news that it’s (DRS) being implemented in the final. I feel it should be there in all matches that are being telecast live,” Tiwary said on Tuesday.
“All teams come through the league stages and we have seen many mistakes. It would be good if all live matches have DRS.
“But our focus is on the match. I hope we won’t need any assistance from DRS and the field umpires will make the right decisions. But, yes, it will give an opportunity to the batters and bowlers.”
Retirement decision on hold
The 37-year-old, who had quit captaincy ahead of 2019-20 season and joined politics, was re-appointed Bengal skipper.
The success of the Bengal side under Tiwary has now made him rethink his earlier decision to quit.

“Yes, I had said I would quit after lifting the Ranji Trophy but after playing so many matches, many of my well-wishers want me to continue. So, I’ve now kept the decision (to retire) on hold.
“At the moment, the focus is on the final. We will see how it goes afterwards,” Tiwary, who is also the state sports minister in the Bengal government, added.

Premier League: Leaders Arsenal host champions City in a potentially decisive encounter,"Gunners have a poor record against Guardiola’s men over the last few years and have been dropping points of late, but the Citizens need to keep their focus with financial fair play charges against the club.","League leaders Arsenal have a mountain to climb on Wednesday night when title rivals Manchester City pay a visit to the Emirates for their first Premier League encounter of the season. Both sides met last month in an FA Cup tie with City edging out the Gunners 1-0 with a Nathan Ake goal.
But this is the big one when it comes to both teams’ Premier League title aspirations. Due to Arsenal’s recent underwhelming form, City, who were at times eight points behind, are within three now and a win will level Pep Guardiola’s team with his protégé Mikel Arteta’s men at 51 points each, putting them ahead on goal difference. Arsenal have a game in hand over their nearest title challengers, something that might have ramifications when the season races towards its climax.
When these two sides met in the FA Cup, Arsenal were in a fine run of form, having lost just once in the league while Manchester City were blowing hot and cold having lost to Manchester United as well as Southampton in the EFL Cup. This time around, City look more confident with their recent 3-1 win over Aston Villa, showcasing everything that makes them look so menacing.
🏃‍♂️ Upping the intensity

However, they have been inconsistent this season, losing 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur before the Villa game. Erling Haaland hasn’t scored a goal since a hat-trick against Wolverhampton Wanderers on January 22. Since then, City have played three matches and in large swathes of them, the Norwegian has been starved of service. He even came off early against Villa after suffering what seemed like a knock and City will be hoping it’s nothing too serious.
Leaders dropping points
Arsenal, meanwhile, are in a tricky patch of form, having lost to relegation strugglers Everton and scraping out a 1-1 draw with Brentford. The Brentford goal was controversial though with referee Lee Mason forgetting to draw offside lines for the equaliser. Christian Norgaard was in an offside position when he crossed for Ivan Toney and the goal would have been ruled out if the VAR lines had been drawn.
But regardless, the Gunners did not look like the freescoring side that has enthralled fans since the season began. And now with City in front of them, they face a team against whom they have failed to win their last 13 Premier League matches. An even more damning stat reveals that the Gunners have been defeated by City in the last 10 encounters which is their longest losing streak against an opponent in their storied history.
We have to be ready 💪#ManCity | @okx pic.twitter.com/JNNfPybZyx

But the shadow of a far bigger threat looms large over City after they were accused of breaching more than 100 financial fair play rules by the Premier League with the defending champions facing the prospect of a points deduction or even getting kicked out of the league altogether. Even though Guardiola passionately stood by his side in a recent press conference and his players and fans responded in kind during the recent win over Aston Villa, the weight of accusations might ultimately be too heavy to take.
It’ll be really interesting to see if City can keep their focus on the field because Arsenal are a very different challenge than an 11th-placed Villa. If it all unravels for City at the Emirates on Wednesday, Arsenal would be a huge step closer to claiming their first Premier League title in 19 years.

Chennai Open ATP Challenge: Novak Djokovic prodigy Medjedovic making rapid strides,"Teenaged Serb, blessed with height, powerful groundstrokes & big serve, is being mentored by World No. 1.","The first thing that strikes about Hamad Medjedovic is his height and physical prowess on court. For a 19-year-old, he looks well built, has powerful strokes and most importantly, can serve at a pace of 220kmph. On Tuesday, playing the first round of the Chennai Open ATP Challenge against Leo Borg and with the great Bjorn Borg watching from the sidelines, he served four aces in a row to clinch the match 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 at the SDAT Stadium.
Watching him, it is not surprising that Novak Djokovic has taken him under his wings and is mentoring the 19-year-old for a smooth transition from the junior circuit to the senior level. In 2020, when Medjedovic defeated top seed Harold Mayot in the French Open juniors, he got a congratulatory message from Djokovic. And by October, he had an audience with the legend himself at Novak Tennis Centre in Belgrade. Two months later, in one of the posts he shared on his Instagram account, Medjedovic is seen training at the academy gym, carbon-copying Djokovic who is seen ahead of him.
“Novak! He has helped me a lot in my career. We met a couple of years ago and he helps me in every possible way for my career. He is always there, giving me a lot of advice and I train at his academy in Belgrade. Just watching him train helps me a lot,” Medjedovic said after his match.

The story goes that when Medjedovic first met Djokovic, the World No. 1 broke the ice straightaway to make the youngster feel comfortable. Medjedovic’s father recollected the tale for Tennis World. “He was a little nervous before meeting Nole. However, even there, thank God, Novak knew how to approach him. I was present when Novak came and said to him: ‘What’s up, Medo? How are you doing, Hame?’ so he hugs him and calls him to play a game of basketball. Novak contributed a lot to Hamad’s relaxation.”
While all of this has raised expectations, Medjedovic says there is absolutely no pressure from Djokovic’s side. The 22-time Grand Slam winner has been helping his compatriot financially too. “Not really (on the pressure to deliver). He wants me to improve my physical and mental game, he tells me I should be more focused on those things than the rankings and I listen to it as much as I can,” Medjedovic said.
Living a dream
For a boy hailing from a small town called Novi Pazar, roughly 200km away from Montenegro, the switch to Belgrade as a nine-year-old to pursue tennis in itself was a challenge. From there, training with the world’s best has been nothing short of a dream come true.
So classy Nole!

“Many times, I thought I was dreaming. I used to pinch myself to ensure I’m not dreaming. But what can you say… It is for sure a surreal experience to train with him (Djokovic). He was the guy I looked up to since I was a kid. To share the court with him, practise with him, I can’t share it in words. You can learn so many things from Novak. He is the most disciplined guy I have ever met and it is something that I admire the most,” Medjedovic said.

Already part of Serbia’s Davis Cup team and having won a match, Medjedovic’s immediate focus is to get used to the senior level. As Djokovic advised, much of his focus is on improving his fitness and he has also flown in his trainer to Chennai. “The switch from juniors to seniors is not really easy. It requires a lot of hard work. It’s completely different. It is very hard… the good tournaments like Challengers, ATP World Tour are sometimes like some other sport. Junior tennis gives you confidence, you start from somewhere, and if you are good at the junior level, you have a chance to do well at the senior level as well. You have got to keep improving,” he added.

Struggling PSG up against Champions League beasts Bayern,"Controversies have hit the Paris club of late, while injured skipper Neuer is at loggerheads with Bavarian giants.","It can’t really be the Champions League knockout stages without a stench of controversy brewing in the ranks of Paris Saint Germain. Before facing German champions Bayern Munich, something feels rotten in the club with reports of outbursts between Neymar and his teammates as well as with PSG chief Luis Campos, a shocking run of form and injuries to their best players in Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.
One can’t really blame the fans if the memories of elimination at the hands of Manchester United in 2019, Barcelona (2017) and Real Madrid (2022), rear their heads again.
What’s common in those defeats, you ask? Well, in all these matches, the French powerhouse had emphatically won the first leg, only to lose their heads in the return leg and getting knocked out in the process.

This year, they will be facing a Bayern team which has had a recent upturn in form, winning their last three matches by scoring more than three goals each time. They are also the side that denied the Parisians their first Champions League trophy, defeating them in the 2020 final. A different monster in the Champions League, the Bavarians have progressed from the Round of 16 stage nine times in the last 10 seasons, a stat that does not bode well for an already shaky Ligue One leaders.
PSG, meanwhile, are having their worst run of form since the World Cup break, having already lost four times since then. Their last two matches were particularly shattering to their confidence with a 2-1 defeat to close rivals Marseille to get knocked out of the French Cup and a 3-1 hammering by Monaco in the league. Their Argentine talisman Messi played in the game vs Marseille but came away with a hamstring strain, something which kept him out of the squad for the match against Monaco.
Meanwhile, Mbappe suffered a muscle tear and was expected to be out for three weeks, which meant that he would be out against Bayern as well. But apparently, he has made a speedy recovery and both him and Messi are in the squad to face Bayern tonight. Head coach Christophe Galtier, however, was cautious while talking about the Mbappe situation saying that “we’re not quite sure if he’ll be on the team sheet.”

Stars need to show up
Fans, meanwhile, will be hoping that the French World Cup winner can make it into the team because without him and Messi, PSG have looked rather listless on the field. Neymar has had a torrid time lifting the workload and his individual game has suffered because of it, leading to a fairly toothless display in the recent loss to Monaco.
With frustration reaching boiling point, the Brazilian superstar reportedly had a go at teammates Vitinha and Hugo Ekitike after the Monaco match. Additionally, when PSG chief Campos slammed the players for failing to show aggression, Neymar and Marquinhos were unhappy with the criticism and had a war of words with him.

The superstar has downplayed the incident since then, comparing it to an argument with his girlfriend. “Yes there was a discussion, we didn’t agree with what we heard. But these things happen. Football isn’t just about love and friendship,” Neymar said.

Bayern Munich, meanwhile, are mired in an off-field controversy of their own with long-time player and captain Manuel Neuer, who is currently out with a broken leg.

In an interview, Neuer had slammed the decision saying it felt like his heart had been ripped out of him, leading to Bayern Munich reportedly taking a decision to fine him £1.4million.
Bayern though have a trusted ’keeper between the sticks, having brought in Borussia Monchengladbach’s Yann Sommer who will be chomping at the bit to make an impression against PSG. The German champions will, however, miss the services of Ryan Gravenberch, Noussair Mazraoui, Lucas Hernandez and Sadio Mane but have enough firepower in their ranks to give the star-studded PSG lineup a run for its money.

Tarlekar’s catch has sparked a debate about whether it was out or not out. Gajanan Jainoji, who is a producer for SportsOn, which broadcasts the match live on their Youtube and Facebook channels, says the catch was referred to the third umpire and then given out. “The decision was referred to the third umpire. After watching the replay from three angles, the umpire gave it out. If you see the video closely, you can his foot was not on the ground when he kicks the ball. We telecast hundred of matches in a month and have been doing this for years, but I have never seen anything like this ever,” says Jainoji.

“I even got a call from the Mumbai Indians office, they wanted the video to use it on their social media. BBC, SKY, and all the other global channels are also showing it,” he adds.

Playing tennis ball cricket is a profession for Tarlekar. The money he earns playing from the tournament he uses to pay for his education and also helps his father, who now works as a security guard. “Din ke teen ya chaar match khel leta hun (I play three or four matches every day). Alag alag tournament hote hai 6 overs ke 8 overs ke 10 overs ke aur prize money bhi different hai. (There are three or four tournaments simultaneously going on and each tourney has different prize money as well),” says Kiran, who is pursuing an M.P.Ed (Masters of Physical Education) and prize money helps him to cover the fees. He gives the rest of the money to his mother.

Liverpool welcome UEFA report on Champions League final chaos,UEFA apologised to Liverpool for initially blaming the Merseyside club's fans for the mayhem following the release of the independent review on Monday.,"Liverpool welcomed a review into the 2022 Champions League final which said organisers UEFA were responsible for the chaos before the game, calling on the European soccer governing body to “take positive and transparent action” to ensure the safety of fans.
UEFA apologised to Liverpool for initially blaming the Merseyside club’s fans for the mayhem following the release of the independent review on Monday.
The final was delayed by 36 minutes after thousands of Liverpool supporters were unable to get into the Stade de France in Paris for the match on May 28, which Real won 1-0, while French police were filmed using tear gas on fans including women and children.
“(The report) fully vindicates Liverpool fans while finding UEFA primarily responsible for organisational failings, absence of overall control or oversight of safety and security, poor planning and lack of contingency plans,” Liverpool said in a statement on Tuesday.
In the hours following the chaos at the UEFA Champions League final in Paris, Liverpool Football Club called on our supporters to write to us outlining their experiences.
— Liverpool FC (@LFC) February 14, 2023
“The evidence-based panel report also found that there was ‘a clear and immediate danger of a fatal crush’ and that the action of Liverpool supporters saved lives.”
The 220-page review followed an investigation chaired by Tiago Brandao Rodrigues, a member of Portugal’s parliament, and had a panel including legal, policing and event-management consultants as well as representatives from fan groups, which outlined 21 recommendations.
“… we call on UEFA and others at the top of the football regulation pyramid to come together and take positive and transparent action to ensure there are no more ‘near misses’,” Liverpool said.
“We implore UEFA to fully enact the recommendations as outlined by the panel, no matter how difficult, to ensure supporter safety is the number one priority at the heart of every UEFA football fixture.”

The report added that the parallels between last year’s Champions League final and the 1989 Hillsborough soccer stadium disaster — in which 97 Liverpool supporters lost their lives — were “palpable”.

“It is shocking that more than 30 years after the Hillsborough disaster any club and our group of fans would be subject to such fundamental safety failings which have had such a devastating impact on so many,” Liverpool said.
“But even more concerning is the realisation that for families, friends and survivors of Hillsborough, Paris has only exacerbated their suffering.”
Following the final, much of the blame was placed on Liverpool fans by France’s Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin but he acknowledged police were caught off-guard by several hundred local “delinquents” who turned up to cause trouble.

Liverpool supporters group ‘Spirit of Shankly’ said the report had “exonerated” the Premier League club’s fans.
“The blame game began even before a ball was kicked, and in the immediate aftermath those supposedly in charge – UEFA and the authorities – had no hesitation in pointing the finger at supporters,” the group said in a statement.
“But now with the publication of the report it is clear, the fans bear no culpability, the panel concluding ‘overarching organisational failures’ were the root of what went so badly wrong.”

Women’s T20 World Cup: India aim for improved bowling show against West Indies,"Mandhana missed the tie against Pakistan owing to a finger injury but the star opener is likely to be back in the team against the West Indies, who are coming off a big loss against England.","Having got the better of Pakistan in the lung-opener, India would endeavour to put up an improved bowling show against West Indies in their second Women’s T20 World Cup match here on Wednesday.
The Indian batters, without vice-captain Smriti Mandhana, managed to complete their highest successful chase in the T20 World Cup in the win against Pakistan.
Mandhana missed the tie against Pakistan owing to a finger injury but the star opener is likely to be back in the team against the West Indies, who are coming off a big loss against England.
The Indian bowlers were guilty of taking their foot off the pedal in the back end of the innings, allowing Pakistan to score 91 runs in the second half of their innings.

They will be keen to give a better account of themselves. With tougher oppositions expected as the tournament progresses, the Indian bowlers couldn’t have asked for a better opponent than a familiar West Indies side, whom India beat twice in the recent tri-series.
If India want to win the title, the batting department too has to pull up its socks.
It if wasn’t for young Richa Ghosh’s three boundaries on the trot in the 18th over, India would have been unable to cross the line.

The big-hitting Shafali Verma, fresh from leading India to the inaugural U-19 World Cup title, didn’t look her imperious best against Pakistan. She struggled to get the big shots.
Opening the innings in the absence of Mandhana, Yastika Bhatia struggled for rhythm while skipper Harmanpreet Kaur too perished without making an impact.
India will breathe a sigh of relief that Jemimah Rodrigues, a proven match-winner, hit form after a underwhelming run as she anchored the innings but the middle-order batter will have to manage her strike rate better and go for the big shots.
The addition of Mandhana, a vital cog in this Indian team’s scheme of things, will not doubt bolster the batting.

West Indies, on the other hand, will be eager to register their first win in the tournament having being thrashed by England in their opener.
The Hayley Matthews-led side is enduring a wretched run, having lost 14 matches on the trot.
They will once again turn to skipper Matthews who has oodles of experience. The skipper is no stranger to delivering on the big stage.

Relieved Juergen Klopp hails Liverpool’s ‘statement’ win over Everton,Mohamed Salah scored for the first time since 'Boxing Day' and January signing Cody Gakpo bagged his first goal for the club as they snapped a four-game winless run and earned only their second win in eight games in all competitions.,"Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said he was relieved after his team won their first Premier League game of 2023 by beating city rivals Everton 2-0 on Monday and urged them to use the “statement” victory to reignite their season.
Mohamed Salah scored for the first time since ‘Boxing Day’ and January signing Cody Gakpo bagged his first goal for the club as they snapped a four-game winless run and earned only their second win in eight games in all competitions.
“It was a massive relief,” Klopp said. “The performance was a statement for us that we can do this … It was the best game for a while.
“We have to carry on. To get out of our situation and to bring consistency, we need performances.”
Liverpool, last year’s runners-up, climbed to ninth with 32 points. They trail fourth-placed Newcastle United by nine before Saturday’s trip to St James’ Park.
Klopp said Liverpool had played like their true selves against Everton but that they had to keep delivering that level of performance.

‘We respect Allan Border but …’ Alex Carey offers Australian’s team official response to Border’s accusation that they were too soft and friendly to India,"Allan Border, who was called Mr Grumpy in his captaincy days, went after Steve Smith for giving a ‘thumb’s up’ gesture to an Indian bowler after he was beaten.","First reactions have come from the Australia team over a bizarre but in-character comment from Allan Border over the way Steve Smith behaved in the first Test.
Border, who was called Mr Grumpy in his captaincy days, went after Steve Smith for giving a ‘thumb’s up’ gesture to an Indian bowler after he was beaten. It’s something that Smith has done throughout his career, part of his mannerisms, but Border, who had predicted that Australia would win the series 2-1, pounced on him to make a point.
“Play with a harder edge. I mean, we’re giving blokes the thumbs up when they’re beating us outside the off stump,” Border said.“What the hell is going on? That is just ridiculous. Don’t go stupid, but Australia play hard nose cricket. We’re even giving someone thumbs up … bloody hell.”
While Smith happenned to trigger Border, his larger point was that Australia were a bit soft.
Now, Alex Carey, the Australian wicketkeeper who was very good behind the stumps and kept sweeping in front of it, served the first official response from the Australian team.
“We highly respect Allan Border,” Carey said. “I guess among the group, guys do it differently. We come up against these players a lot.
“You’re probably alluding to the Steve Smith comment more than any but, you know, he’s mates with a lot of them. And that’s the way he [Smith] plays. He does it in all situations. He plays around with his hands and does all that stuff. And I think that’s probably what gets him pretty focused.
““They’re obviously strong comments but, as a group, we believe in what we’re doing and come the second Test we’re ready to put a few learnings into place.”

According to a Mirror report, Barnes have said that Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho have grown as a player after Ronaldo’s exit as United have lost just once since Ronaldo departed the club, with that defeat coming to Premier League leaders Arsenal.
Manchester United and Cristiano Ronaldo parted ways last year after
his explosive interview with Piers Morgan. In his interview, Ronaldo had blasted Manchester United and manager Erik ten Hag in an incendiary TV interview, saying he feels “betrayed” by the club and that senior figures have tried to force him out of Old Trafford.
“I think that since Ronaldo has gone, look at Sancho, look at Rashford, a lot of players are doing better because Ronaldo overshadowed them,” Barnes told BonusCodeBets.
“I think Rashford had a bit of a dip, because he wanted to be one of the main players of Man Utd, as he is. I think it’s not a surprise to me that you can see an improvement in him since Ronaldo is not there anymore. Rashford is not a centre-forward.

Australian all-rounder Cameron Green is not Harry Potter or Superman: Former England captain Michael Vaughan,"Medium-pace bowling all-rounder Cameron Green, recovering from a finger injury, could be key to Australia fielding three spinners; Green bowling at full speed but not facing pacers in the nets","The match fitness of all-rounder Cameron Green could be the key to Australia launching a fightback after going 0-1 down in the first of the four Test matches in Nagpur. The medium-pace bowling all-rounder had broken the little finger in his right hand when batting against South Africa in the Boxing Day Test. If Green is fit, it gives Australia the option of playing three spinners.
Veteran off-spinner Nathan Lyon and debutant off-spinner Todd Murphy were the two frontline slow bowlers to feature in the opening Test match, one which India won by an innings and 132 runs.
According to The Age, Green has been bowling at full pace, but the tall all-rounder has not been facing the fast bowlers in the practice nets. He is still using a rubber ball during catching practice.
Uncapped left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann has joined the touring Australian side but his inclusion could depend on the match fitness of Green, The Age reported.
According to Fox Sports, fast bowler Josh Hazlewood who is out with a left Achilles injury, is also in doubt for the second Test in Delhi. Mitchell Starc, the star strike bowler in the side, missed the first Test because of a finger injury but is expected to train in Delhi ahead of the Test match.

Peter Bol: doping suspension lifted after samples didn’t match,Peter Bol said he’s never taken banned performance-enhancing substances and he described the last month as a “nightmare.”,"Olympic 800-meter finalist Peter Bol on Tuesday said his provisional doping suspension has been lifted after the A and B samples didn’t match.
Usually testing of the B sample confirms a doping infringement.
“I was just informed that my B sample did not match my A sample,” Bol posted on Twitter. “My provisional suspension has been lifted by Sport Integrity Australia.”
Bol said he’s never taken banned performance-enhancing substances and he described the last month as a “nightmare.”
Athletics Australia announced last month that Bol had failed an out-of-competition test on Oct. 11. The 28-year-old runner’s A sample tested positive to the banned drug erythropoietin, known as EPO.
“The relief I am feeling is hard to describe.” he said. “The last month has been nothing less than a nightmare. I wish that the results of my A sample had not been leaked, but there is nothing I can do about that.

Jamieson’s injury is a reocurrence of the one that ruled him out of the England test tour in June, said head coach Gary Stead.
“Since the injury in June we’ve certainly taken a cautious approach to managing his return with regular monitoring by our medical staff which has included scans,” Stead said.
“While Kyle’s not feeling any pain, the evidence is pretty clear he has a stress-fracture and so he’ll return to Christchurch today and have a CT scan on Friday before we decide on the next steps.”

"T20 World Cup: England 2 from 2, South Africa back on track",Host South Africa put in a strong performance in the field to bowl New Zealand out for 67 and win by 65 runs to get back on track after surprisingly losing the tournament opener to Sri Lanka.,"England made it two from two at the Women’s T20 World Cup when 18-year-old Alice Capsey’s rapid 51 from 22 balls set up a four-wicket win over Ireland in Paarl on Monday.
Host South Africa put in a strong performance in the field to bowl New Zealand out for 67 and win by 65 runs to get back on track after surprisingly losing the tournament opener to Sri Lanka.
England’s victory kept it top of Group 2 ahead of India having played a game more. South Africa is third in Group 1 behind Sri Lanka and Australia and still has work to do to progress. The top two teams from each group go through to the semifinals.
England’s route to victory should have been much easier after bowling the Irish out for just 105 in 18.2 overs, spinners Sophie Ecclestone (3-13), Sarah Glenn (3-19) and Charlie Dean (2-26) collecting eight wickets.
But England’s chase stuttered straight away when Sophia Dunkley tried to heave one over the top in the first over and was caught at mid-on by Arlene Kelly.
Capsey put England back on course as she raced to her half-century in just 21 balls, hammering 46 in boundaries with 10 fours and a six. It was a match-winning intervention by a player who looked likely to miss the World Cup when she broke her collarbone diving for a catch against West Indies in December.
Her recovery — aided by screws and a metal plate in her shoulder — came quicker than expected and she did enough to set up the win, even when wickets fell after she was out.
ADVERTISEMENT
Capsey’s dismissal, to a diving catch in the outfield by Leah Paul, sparked a run of five English wickets for 33 runs before Katherine Sciver-Brunt and Ecclestone saw their team home.
No. 2-ranked England reached 107-6 in 14.2 overs for a scratchy win and faces a big test against No. 4 India in its next match on Saturday.

On a day when 10 Indian players got crore-plus deals, skipper Harmanpreet Kaur came much cheaper for Mumbai Indians at nearly half the price of Mandhana at Rs 1.80 crore. Harmanpreet is also not the highest paid in her team where England’s Nat Sciver-Brunt got way more at Rs 3.20 crore.
In fact, Harmanpreet was not even among the top-six Indian buys as the second costliest player from the country is all-rounder Deepti Sharma, who was bought by UP Warriorz for Rs 2.6 crore.

The hard-hitting Shafali Verma and Jemimah Rodrigues, the star of the T20 World Cup win against Pakistan on Sunday, were picked by Delhi Capitals for Rs 2 crore and Rs 2.20 crore respectively. All-rounders Pooja Vastrakar and Richa Ghosh laughed their way to the bank with Rs 1.90 crore deals each offered by MI and RCB respectively.
Jemimah and Richa’s deals were also a case of recency bias as the Pakistan match on Sunday did play a big role.
Yastika Bhatia, who opened the batting with Shafali Verma against Pakistan, went to Mumbai Indians for Rs 1.5 crore.
The two other Indians who got crore-plus deals were Renuka Thakur (bought by RCB at Rs 1.5 crore) and Devika Vaidya (bought by UP Warriorz at Rs 1.4 crore).
However, Delhi Capitals pulled off a coup by roping in one of contemporary women’s cricket’s best leaders Meg Lanning of Australia for Rs 1.10 crore.

The RCB, which teed off the buying spree, also explained their choices and the price attached to it.
“Everyone knows Mandhana and (Australia’s Elysse) Perry — Rs 1.7 crore); we were pretty committed to the couple of people we wanted to get. We’re very happy to get such quality players. It’s a dream result for us to get Mandhana, Perry and (Sophie) Devine (Rs 50 lakh),” RCB Director of Cricket Mike Hesson said during a media interaction.
“Smriti has got plenty of captaincy experience and is familiar with the Indian conditions, so highly likely (she’ll be the captain).” Mandhana, who watched the auction with her team cheering each bid, was ecstatic.

“We have been watching auction of men’s (players). It is such a big moment for women to have an auction of this sort. The whole thing is exacting. RCB’s legacy is big, they have built a big fan-base. Hope we both can together build a big team,” Mandhana said.
Deepti, on her part, said, “We waited for this opportunity and since I am from UP, it is a great feeling. I want to contribute as much as possible for UP Warriorz.” One of the prominent picks during the first round of auction was Australia’s off-spin all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner, who was bought by Gautam Adani-owned Gujarat Giants for Rs 3.20 crore (USD 386,000). Gardner and Nat Sciver are the two highest-paid overseas players.
Gujarat primarily bought foreign players and are yet to buy prominent India players save Harleen Deol for Rs 40 lakh.

Star Australian all-rounder Perry received a cool Rs 1.70 crore (USD 205,000) winning bid from RCB, who also got New Zealand skipper Devine dirt cheap at a base price of Rs 50 lakh.

The five potential captains are Mandhana (RCB), Harmanpreet (MI), Lanning (DC), Beth Mooney (Gujarat Giants) and Deepti Sharma (UP Warriorz).
Some of the big names to miss out are Sri Lankan skipper Chamari Atapatthu and South African batter Laura Wolvaardt.

Lewis was the top-scorer for Ireland and her 37-ball 36 had five fours. The opening stand involving Lewis and Hunter was the highest for Ireland.
Ecclestone, who was bought by UP Warriorz in the WPL auctions, got two wickets in two balls in the 13th over — that of Lewis and Eimear Richardson (0) — but could not complete her hat-trick. She also had the crucial wicket of Ireland captain Laura Delany (12).
Pacers Lauren Bell and Katherine Sciver-Brunt took a wicket each.

Kylian Mbappe in PSG’s squad for Bayern Champions League clash,"PSG have been in poor form recently, losing 3-1 at Monaco in Ligue 1 on Saturday for their fourth defeat of the year in all competitions.","Kylian Mbappe was included in Paris St Germain’s squad for Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 first leg against Bayern Munich at the Parc des Princes after taking part in training although his participation in the clash was still in doubt.
The France forward, who had initially been ruled out for three weeks with a hamstring injury he sustained on Feb. 1, was on the pitch with his team mates on Sunday and Monday.
Coach Christophe Galtier on Saturday said he would take ‘zero risk’ with Mbappe.
Lionel Messi and influential midfielder Marco Verratti are also back from injury.
“What I can tell you is that the team who will play tomorrow will look nothing like that who played against Monaco,” Galtier told a news conference.
“Kylian did the whole session today. I didn’t think he would be on the pitch yesterday. We made the decision that he would train with everyone today.
“We’re not sure yet whether he will be on the match sheet, we will decide tomorrow after discussing with him and the medical staff.

WPL Auction: Veda Krishnamurthy says she’s ‘little surprised’ that Jemimah went for more money than Harmanpreet Kaur,"For Jemimah, who started at a base price of Rs 50 lakh, UP Warriorz, Delhi Capitals, and Mumbai Indians battled before the Delhi franchise got her for Rs 2.2 crore","The first-ever auction of the Women’s Premier League in Mumbai had more than a few surprises in store as the five franchises pulled out the cheque book and over 400 players went under the hammer.
One of the talking points of the auction was the fact that Harmanpreet Kaur, who is currently captaining the Indian women’s cricket team in South Africa as they bid to win the ICC T20 World Cup, fetched a price of Rs 1.8 crore while Jemimah Rodrigues was signed for Rs 2.2 crore.
Harmanpreet, who was one of the first players to come up for the auctions, was picked by Mumbai Indians after a bidding war between Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Capitals, UP Warriorz and Mumbai Indians.
For Jemimah, who started at a base price of Rs 50 lakh, UP Warriorz, Delhi Capitals, and Mumbai Indians battled before the franchise based in the capital of the country got her for Rs 2.2 crore. Each team had an auction purse of Rs 12 crore each. Deepti Sharma, meanwhile, went to the Warriorz after an intense burst of bidding that saw her price tag go up from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2.6 crore.
“I’m a little bit surprised that Jemimah has gone for more money than what Harmanpreet Kaur has, because the kind of experience that Harman brings in is invaluable. But at the same time I’m not at all surprised at the price tag of Deepti Sharma because she brings in two skills, and is a potential captaincy choice as well. So that is not surprising. But at the same time, this is how auctions go. You have to figure out what is the amount left in the bank and we’ll probably see this throughout the day,” Krishnamurthy, who is a part of Viacom18 ’s expert panel for the first-ever WPL auction, told The Indian Express.
The strategy of Royal Challengers Bangalore in the auction was to go for the big names from the top of the auction, which quickly saw them exhaust nearly half of their purse very early on. They spent Rs 3.40 crore on Smriti Mandhana, which was just over 28 percent of their total purse of Rs 12 crore. They also got players like Ellyse Perry (Rs 1.7 crore), Sophie Devine and Renuka Singh (Rs 1.5 crore) early on. By that time, Delhi Daredevils had not even filled one player on their roster.
Talking about teams’ team strategy to fork out the big bucks for players with leadership qualities, Krishnamurthy said: “Having a leader is very important for any team. Especially in T20 format where you need to be very proactive and don’t have time to sit around and thing what is going to happen. That was the strategy applied by RCB as well. It helped that Smriti’s was the first name in the auction.”

"‘It’s about making history and for the country,’ says tennis star Yibing after becoming first Chinese man to beat a former top-10 ranked player","On Sunday, the 23-year-old Yibing became the first Chinese man to win an ATP Tour title with a 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 7-6(12) win over American John Isner in the Dallas Open. Yibing saved four championship points enroute becoming the first Chinese man to clock a win over a former top-10 ranked player in the world.","Back in 2017, when a 17-year-old Wu Yibing won the US Open juniors singles and doubles titles, China’s flagship news programme Xinwen Lianbo reportedly covered the feat for 43 seconds. In the past, NBA star Yao Ming’s retirement had got a coverage of 53 seconds and Li Na’s French Open win had got a coverage of more than a minute.
On Sunday, the 23-year-old Yibing became the first Chinese man to win an ATP Tour title with a 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 7-6(12) win over American John Isner in the Dallas Open. Yibing saved four championship points enroute becoming the first Chinese man to clock a win over a former top-10 ranked player in the world.
“It’s not only about winning the title, I think it’s more about me personally making history and also for the country. That’s huge for the next generation. For me, I need to keep going, keep my body healthy. I’m sure there’s more to come,” Wu said post the title win in Dallas.
Hailing from Hangzhou, Wu’s father is a former boxer with his mother taking a young Wu for training in his younger days. The Chinese youngster had started playing tennis at an age of six on the insistence of his mother to lose weight.
‘I made history for myself and my country’ – China’s Wu after winning 1st title #吴易昺 #WuYibing @ShLetsMeet @ShanghaiMasters #ATPDallas pic.twitter.com/cr2YcR7aaq
— DragonTV🚀䒕雅official (@ShanghaiEye) February 13, 2023
At the age of 12, Wu started training under coach Carlos Rodriguez, the former coach of two-time grand slam winner Chinese tennis player Li Na and former world number one Justine Henin at Beijing before he made a shift to Spain to train under coach Nahum Garicia Sanchez. “In general, the Chinese players, we’re working a lot on the baseline. We’re missing some shots like slicing, like volleys. So this is something I’m missing from my junior time of practising, which I’m looking forward to improving,” Wu had told ATP Tour earlier about his time in Europe.
In 2017, Wu had created history when he won the US Open juniors singles’ title along with the doubles title, a feat which saw him becoming China’s first boys slam singles champion. In the final, Wu had scored a 6-4-6-4 win over Argentina’s Alex Geller. In 2018, Wu won his first ATP Challenger title in Shanghai and the same year, he drew praise from the likes of Roger Federer. “For him (Wu) to play in a tournament like this, starting to play against the best, is what I did in ’98, as well,” Federer had said during the ATP Rolex Masters in 2018.
However, Wu suffered an elbow injury next year, forcing him to be away from the game for close to three years. He made his return last year and won three ATP Challenger titles before qualifying for the US Open. The Chinese youngster reached the third round of the US Open before suffering a loss against former world number one Daniil Medvedev. Wu’s 15-match winning streak before the third round exit coupled with his three ATP Challenger Tour titles saw his world ranking rise from 1749 to 174 and later in the top-100. It also got him the ATP Tour comeback of the year award.
“I think mentally I am ready to overcome all the injuries I might come across in the near future. My body is not strong enough like other players, so I am ready to put more effort in the gym and stretching room. One of the important lessons I have to learn is how to prevent injury.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Wu was also one of the three Chinese players to feature in this year’s Australian Open. But there was a time when Wu also faced a coaching dilemma as his mother wanted him to change coaches. At the start of 2019, Wu had to part his ways with coach Sven Groeneveld after a training stint of eight months with the coach blaming Wu’s mother for the split.
“My Coaching Update: I am no longer working with Wu Yibing. In my opinion. He has a right to have a coach whose views are better aligned with his mother. I want to thank Wu Yibing for a great past 8 months winning the Silver Medal at the Asian Games and his first win on ATP Tour,” Groeneveld had tweeted in 2019.
He currently spends his time in the USA, training at different centres. “Tennis is a lonely sport. I don’t have many friends on the Tour. I missed a few years of these tournaments. My coaches and my physio, they have to keep me up, keep me hungry about playing matches and keep me fit. All these little things make a team. Here, I can chill after a long day of practice. I can just chill on my bed and watch some great games.” Wu had told ATP tour.

The young tennis star is also a sensation on Chinese social media, where he interacts with his fans regularly over live streams. “I do it because I have some free time and I want to talk to someone. Instead of playing video games, I choose to do the live streaming and interact with all the Chinese fans. Maybe some junior players will get inspired by it. I guess gaining some supporters is never a bad thing,” Wu said.

Wu has now climbed to the 58th spot in the ATP Rankings and his title win in Dallas also drew praise from Isner. The American had smashed 44 aces in the final against Wu before the Chinese emerged triumphant. “I swear I thought I won the match a few times. I know he hit one ball, and it had to be on the back sixteenth of the line… Sports can be brutal. He is an unbelievable ball striker and a very good talent,” Isner said.
As for Wu, he will be live streaming with his fans post the title win and sounded out a warning to the fellow players. “I’ve been through a lot of things. I think the reason now I’m relaxed on tennis courts is I trust myself. If you want to beat me, you have to work hard,” said Wu.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/tennis-star-wu-yibing-after-becoming-first-chinese-man-to-beat-a-former-top-10-ranked-player-8441711/,sports

"IND vs AUS: As Dharamshala Test moves to Indore, ‘appalled’ fans count their losses","IND vs AUS: A fan group stands to lose Rs 60,000 on hotel reservations and Rs 1 lakh on cancelled flight tickets.","As many as 152 Australian fans are set to lose approximately A$3000 after the Board of Control for Cricket in India shifted the third Test between India and Australia from Dharamshala to Indore at the eleventh hour. The BCCI on Monday was forced to take the decision after it found the outfield facilities at the stadium ill-equipped to host a Test. Several Indian fans were counting their losses, as they had to cancel tickets and hotel bookings.
According to Luke Sparrow, who is the head of Australian Cricket Tours (ACT), due to Dharamshala’s popularity as one of the most picturesque venues in the world, overlooked by the Dhauladhar ranges, around 120 fans had booked their air tickets and hotel exclusively for the Test. Most of them had specifically booked for the Dharamashala Test—to put this in perspective, only 12 ACT members watched the Nagpur Test.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-venue-for-third-test-shifted-to-indore-from-dharamshala-8441386/,sports
Big Bash blamed for Australia’s dismal performance at Nagpur. ‘There was a big push for Big Bash’,"The newspaper then spoke to Steve o Keefe, the spinner who stunned India in the first Test at Pune in 2017, who talked up the preparation last time around. They had based first in Dubai for a long camp, where they played a couple of practice games.","It didn’t take long for a T20 league to be blamed for national team’s poor performance. With India, IPL used to be a fall guy a while back though these days no one carps about it. Now, Australia have dusted up the old T20 league bashing, blaming Big Bash for their poor performance in the first Test at Nagpur.
In a provocatively titled piece ‘How the Big Bash compromised Australia’s tour of India’ The Sydney Morning Herald lets rip.
There was a big push for the Big Bash,” a source told SMH. “It was comfortably the shortest preparation time we’ve ever had for a tour of India.”
The newspaper then spoke to Steve o Keefe, the spinner who stunned India in the first Test at Pune in 2017, who talked up the preparation last time around. They had based first in Dubai for a long camp, where they played a couple of practice games.
““The wickets probably didn’t resemble a lot of what we got in India. However, they were slow, they were low. There was a lot of heat.”
They also played a tour game in Mumbai at the Brabourne stadium where both teams scored in excess of 400 in their first innings. Keefe valued that experience.

““It got me conditioned physically, it got me conditioned mentally, it got me conditioned on how I was going to ball on those wickets. It got me talking to the batters and got the group together. I really rated it, and even though it was a green top I still bowled 20-odd overs and took three wickets. It was great.” In memory, it wasn’t a green top, though, but that’s besides the point.

Keefe spoke about how the current preparation – the 4-day camp in Bangalore and a few sessions at the North Sydney – wasn’t ideal. “Our batters maybe didn’t get as much out of it as what they would have liked, but you’re still batting in the heat, there’s still something to be taken out of it. I think just going over there for a few nets sessions and having a scarified wicket at North Sydney doesn’t compare. But you’ve got to put that trust in that group as well and what they think is the right way to prepare.”

Shaun Marsh too talks about how the Dubai games were priceless in his preparation for the India tour in 2017. ““It definitely helped,” Shaun said after batting out a gutsy draw with Peter Handscomb in the third Test of 2017. “We obviously had a great couple of weeks over there to get us ready for these conditions.

IND vs AUS: Ian Healy terms scuppering of Australia practice session at Nagpur as ‘horrible’,The former Australian wicket-keeper called for the ICC to step in as Australian team management’s request for a practice session at Nagpur post the loss in the first Test was cancelled with the curators watering down the pitches.,"Calling the Vidarbha Cricket Association decision to not let Australia hold a practice session post the loss by an innings and 132 runs against India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on Saturday last week as ‘horrible.’
Former Australian wicket-keeper Ian Healy slammed the VCA authorities for watering the pitches at the Nagpur stadium. According to Cricket.Com.au, a member of the VCA ground staff was seen watering down the pitches at the stadium resulting in the cancellation of practice sessions of Australian players post the Australian team’s embarrassing loss on Saturday.
“It’s really embarrassing the scuppering of our plans to get some practice sessions on that Nagpur wicket. That’s not good, that’s just not good for cricket. The ICC needs to step in here. For them to water the wicket unceremoniously when it was requested for practice is horrible and that has to improve,” Healy said while speaking on SEN Radio on Monday morning.
Read | IND vs AUS: Australia’s plan to practice on Nagpur pitch spoiled by curators
With the Australian team suffering an innings and 132-run loss in the first Test of the four match Test series, the spotlight has been on the Australian batsmen with none of the Australian batsmen managing to cross the fifty-run mark in either innings. While the talk before the first Test match was about the curators watering selected areas of the pitch, the Australian team did not play any tour game in India. Post the loss, the Australian management had planned to have a practice session. According to news.com.au, the Australian team management had requested that the post match watering of pitches be delayed for them to have a practice session.
Australian coach Andrew McDonald told SEN Radio that the planned practice session was not “naughty boy nets” but in accordance with their plans to practice for the next match. The coach also talked about the Indian management’s intent with the kind of wickets they want to play on.

"Leeds, Man United condemn tragedy chants by rival fans",The Premier League echoed the condemnation.,"Leeds and Manchester United condemned “completely unacceptable” chants by rival fans about tragedies involving both clubs during Sunday’s Premier League match at Elland Road.
The Premier League also said it would treat the issue as a “matter of urgency.”
The game, which United won 2-0, was marred by some Leeds fans goading United supporters with chants about the Munich air disaster on Feb. 6, 1958. Some United supporters taunted the home crowd with chants about the death of Leeds fans in Istanbul in 2000.
“Both clubs strongly condemn chanting from both sets of fans regarding historic tragedies at today’s game,” Leeds and United said in a joint statement. “Such behavior is completely unacceptable and we will continue to work together with our respective fan groups and the Premier League and other authorities on eradicating it from football.”
The Premier League echoed the condemnation.
“The League is treating the issue of tragedy chanting as a priority and as a matter of urgency,” it said.

Rashford broke the deadlock at Elland Road with a bullet header 10 minutes from time and has now scored 21 goals in all competitions this season.
“He’s definitely one of them (best strikers in Europe),” Ten Hag told reporters. “From the first moment, I was really excited to work with him. I thought I could get more out of him and he has so many skills.
“He has such high potential and I think there can be even more. He can score more goals because he can score with his right, with his left and with his head.”
Rashford’s haul this season is only one fewer than his best goalscoring campaign in 2019-20, with 15 Premier League games remaining.
Ten Hag revelled in the atmosphere inside Leeds’s Elland Road stadium but was not totally satisfied with his team’s performance.
“I didn’t feel the hostility. I think it was a great atmosphere. Great ambience,” Ten Hag added. “It has to be in a rivalry. It has to be like this and we really enjoyed it.

Jadeja has 2,593 runs at 37.03 including three hundreds; since 2019, Jadeja has the eighth best average in Test cricket (49.37 in 31 innings), the second best for his country after Rohit Sharma (57.65). Needless to dwell, none of the top 10 bats as low as Jadeja does. His overall average of 37.04 bests the legendary pair of Ian Botham and Kapil Dev, and is just a few decimals behind Imran Khan.

"Leander Paes laments state of Indian Davis Cup, says will take a decade to lift standard",The Indian Davis Cup team was relegated to World Group 2 for the first time after a 2-3 loss to Denmark in their away fixture earlier this month.,"Indian tennis icon Leander Paes is pained by the relegation of the country’s Davis Cup team and feels it will take a “better half of a decade” to lift the standard.
The Indian Davis Cup team was relegated to World Group 2 for the first time after a 2-3 loss to Denmark in their away fixture earlier this month.
“I feel like it’s going to take a few years, until the Davis Cup team has some serious talent in it,” said the player with a record 45 doubles victories in Davis Cup.
Indian tennis’ decline was apparent during the Australian Open last month when, for the first time since 2017, no player from the country could make the cut to compete in the qualification round of a Grand Slam.
“I feel quite saddened in a way that we don’t have one player in the singles ranking in the top-300. I don’t think that’s ever happened,” said the Olympic bronze medallist.
Prajnesh Gunneswaran is currently the highest-ranked Indian in singles at 306 on the ATP list.
“I’ve tremendous respect for all our Indian players who are travelling on the circuit in a sport like tennis where the cost of training and conducting (making a) the career is so expensive.” “In tennis, where 99 per cent of the sport is played outside the country, being alone on the circuit is not easy. Zeeshan (Ali) and I have slept in locker rooms because we didn’t have money to pay for a hotel.

“That being said, I think it’s going to take a better half of a decade for the Davis Cup team to have that quality like we had when Ramesh Krishnan, Zeeshan Ali, Vijay Amritraj and all of us had… To get to the semi-finals in the Davis Cup is tougher now,” he said.
Leander was addressing the media sitting beside his father Dr Vece Paes, a bronze medallist at the 1971 hockey World Cup in Barcelona, and the Munich Olympics in 1972.
Biopic in the pipeline
Leander, who campaigned for the Trinamool Congress ahead of the Goa Assembly elections last year, refused to take any political questions and said he’s currently busy working on a biopic to portray the father-son duo’s legacy on the big screen. He revealed that it should be ready in 18 months.
“I’m working on my own story right now. I will give a little nugget today that the Leander storyboard is being worked on right now. I can’t speak much about it.
“It will be a story of how baba (father) won his Olympic medal in 1972 and a few of you are old enough to know what happened there.

“You all will understand why a young boy growing up to my father’s history, my passion was to emulate him. So it’s going to be about 1972 to 1996 really.
“It’s going to be an inspirational story on how not necessarily you have to be the tallest, most talented, skilled (person) to become an athlete… Not necessarily you will have to have great infrastructure either.
“I’m working on a storyboard at the moment and hopefully in 18 months you will get to see it and the posters will be out there.” Asked whether he wants to get into sports administration and join the All India Tennis Association (AITA), he gave an indirect reply.
“I was born into a house where both my parents played for Tiranga (Tri-colour), I grew up in a house where I ironed my father’s playing jersey, which had No. 10 on it. My mother’s jersey was No. 5,” said Leander, who was born into a sports family with father a hockey Olympian and mother, Jennifer, an Indian basketball captain.

“When I look at India as a whole, for me doing things for the community and creating opportunities for the youth is the most important thing. The next decade would be very interesting as we are the youngest country in the world.
“When you talk about sports as a vehicle to give opportunity to the youth, that is where my passion is. My passion is giving opportunities to the youth so that they can live their dreams.”
Djokovic, the GOAT
Leander also hailed Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open victory last month, that brought him on par with Rafael Nadal’s 22 career Grand Slams.
The win came just a year after the Serbian was deported from the same venue for not being vaccinated against COVID-19.

“Djokovic didn’t get a chance to play in Australia because of COVID issues, but it was wonderful to see him winning the Australian Open on his return last month.
“For me his perseverance, his tenacity, his grit is something that I admire a lot. Yes, he gets a bit of a bad reputation because of the way he conducts the passion, the confidence that he has, the way he’s bold in making statements.
“A few people may not like his personality but for me I’ve so much respect for his personality. He comes from a country that is really hard and tough and from there to become a champion, speaks a lot.

"Watching son play from stands, you get more nervous: Bjorn Borg","""I am very happy to see him play, but not all the time. He has his team, he is doing things with his coach. Me and my wife, whenever we have time, we like to see him once in a while (on Tour),"" Borg told reporters here on Sunday.","Bjorn Borg, who won five straight Wimbledon titles from 1976-80, says watching his son Leo play matches makes him more nervous than himself playing as the Swedish tennis legend makes a trip to Chennai for the ATP Challenger tournament beginning on Monday.
“I am very happy to see him play, but not all the time. He has his team, he is doing things with his coach. Me and my wife, whenever we have time, we like to see him once in a while (on Tour),” Borg told reporters here on Sunday.
“I think that he does not want to see us all the time (laughs). I love to see him. It is worse to watch your son or daughter from the stands, because you get even more nervous. It is better when you play yourself, you have no control when sitting in the stands,” he said.
The 66-year-old Borg, who has also won six French Open titles, said his 19-year-old son Leo “is very motivated but long way to go”.
“He is working really hard on the court and off the court. I am very happy to see him, we have a really good relationship. He knows what to do and what not to do. He is hungry to improve his game and be a top player.” Borg, who won 11 Grand Slam titles during an illustrious career, spoke about the importance of a sports psychologist.
“I retired early from tennis, when I was 26. At that time, when I was travelling … at the airports, restaurants, hotels, I would never be by myself. If I stayed at a hotel, there were hundreds of people in the lobby. I could not do anything.
“I felt I was stuck in a way that I really did not have a life besides tennis. I mean, I love tennis. I could not have a private life, that is why I stepped away from tennis.” He said these days tennis has more security more than the players had during his playing days.

“We did not have that. People were after us all the time. Today, the players are more protected. That is important for the sport.
Psychologically, it is mentally difficult to play tennis. You are by yourself on court and you have to make decisions.
“It (having a chat with a psychologist) is important, but he is not going to tell you what you got to do at 30 all, 30-40 break point. That is your own decision. That is what makes tennis so difficult. But, it is one of the biggest sports.” He said personally speaking a tennis player should not need a coach and one should find out what to do and what not to do on the court.
“Personally, I do not think one needs coaching. No one is going to tell you ‘you have to do this, that’. I do not agree with coaching. You have to make your own decisions,” he said.

Borg said he was proud to be the captain of Team Europe in the Laver Cup.

IOC’s Thomas Bach says Olympics on history’s side in Russia issue,"Bach and the IOC have faced a widespread backlash from Ukraine and its allies, including comments directed at him by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy","Insisting sports had to respect the human rights of all athletes, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach on Sunday denied that the organisation was on the wrong side of history by helping Russians and Belarusians qualify for the 2024 Paris Summer Games.
Bach and the IOC have faced a widespread backlash from Ukraine and its allies, including comments directed at him by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, since setting out a path last month for some athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to international competition despite the war waged by their countries.
Asked Sunday at the Alpine skiing world championships if the IOC could be on the wrong side of history, Bach dismissed the suggestion.
“No, history will show who is doing more for peace. The ones who try to keep lines open, to communicate, or the ones who want to isolate or divide,” the IOC leader said.
“We have shown this in the past with great success in the Olympic movement,” Bach said, pointing to the examples of North and South Korea, Israel and Palestine, and Kosovo. “Our role is bringing people together.”
Bach spoke with international media ahead of the men’s downhill, the marquee race in a sport from which Russians and Belarusians were excluded since the war started last February. Ivan Kovbasnyuk was the only Ukrainian skier taking part.
Kovbasnyuk told The Associated Press earlier at the championships no Russians should be allowed at Paris, echoing comments by Ukrainian Olympic medalists including boxer Wladimir Klitschko, high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh and tennis player Elina Svitolina.

“Russia is killing my people. Not good situation for Olympic Committee,” Kovbasnyuk said in Courchevel.
Bach spoke Sunday of his support for “every Ukrainian athlete. We can from a human point of view understand their reactions, we share their suffering.”
“Every Ukrainian athlete can be rest assured that we are standing in full solidarity with them and that all their comments are taken very, very seriously into consideration,” he said.
The IOC has cited advice from United Nations human rights experts that banning athletes on the basis of their passport would be discrimination.
ADVERTISEMENT
Germany and Japan were not invited to the 1948 London Olympics after they were the aggressors in World War II and South Africa was excluded from 1964-88 because of its racist Apartheid laws.
“The IOC being committed to human rights, like the international sports federations, has of course to address these serious concerns,” Bach said Sunday, adding Olympic sports had a “unifying mission of bringing people together” amid other wars across the world.
Olympic leaders have set out a path for athletes from Russia and Belarus who have not actively supported the war to try to qualify and compete as “neutral athletes” without a national identity such as team uniforms, flags and anthems. Governing bodies of each Olympic sport must decide if and how athletes could compete.
But Zelenskyy told a summit of sports officials from 36 countries Friday that Russian athletes have “no place” in Paris while the invasion of Ukraine continues.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Unfortunately, what they have not addressed, at least so far as we can see, are these human rights concerns,” Bach said Sunday. “There, we don’t have an answer but we have to take it seriously.”
Political leaders of Ukraine’s nearby allies in Poland and the Baltic states have said there could be Olympic boycotts if the IOC forges ahead with its plan. Any country that boycotts Paris will likely have their national Olympic body suspended by the IOC.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who visited Kyiv last week, has also said Russian and Belarusian athletes should be barred from the Olympics in her city if the war is still going on by then.

Arpit Vasavada guides Saurashtra to Ranji Trophy final,"The 2019-20 edition champions scored the required 115 runs for victory on the fifth and final day of the semifinal match to set up a title showdown with Bengal. It will be a repeat of the 2019-20 summit clash, where Bengal had finished second best.","Saurashtra secured a place in the Ranji Trophy final for the fifth time in the history of the tournament, defeating Karnataka by four wickets at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Sunday.
The 2019-20 edition champions scored the required 115 runs for victory on the fifth and final day of the semifinal match to set up a title showdown with Bengal. It will be a repeat of the 2019-20 summit clash, where Bengal had finished second best.
Saurashtra skipper Arpit Vasavada, following his match-altering double century in the first innings that helped the team to a mammoth 527, played another polished knock of unbeaten 47 just when the Karnataka bowlers had reduced the team to 42/5 in the second innings.
With Karnataka looking poised to defend a paltry 100-plus total on home turf and Krishnappa Gowtham (3/38) and Vasuki Koushik (3/32) on fire, the 34-year-old Vasavada remained calm under trying circumstances to guide his side to a hard-fought win in 34.2 overs.
Karnataka, whose first innings had folded up at 407 after which Saurashtra slammed 527 to take the crucial first-innings lead, started day five at 123/4 with their in-form batter Nikin Jose on 54.
The young batter, who came at the fall of Devdutt Padikkal in the final session on Saturday, shared a century partnership with captain Mayank Agarwal (55) and guided his team to 114.
But, thereafter, the 22-year-old couldn’t find a partner who could stick around with him and put up a fighting total on the board.
Karnataka’s second innings wound up at 234 in 58.2 overs, with some of their key batters like Ravikumar Samarth, Padikkal, Manish Pandey and Shreyas Gopal departing at single-digit scores.
ADVERTISEMENT
India white-ball player Chetan Sakariya did the maximum damage with his left-arm medium-pace bowling, returning with figures of 4/49 in 11 overs, while Saurashtra’s veteran left-arm spinner Dharmendrasinh Jadeja kept rattling the home team batters to also return a four-wicket haul.
Saurashtra, however, made heavy weather of the paltry 115-run winning target, with the entire top and middle order being wiped out by Karnataka bowlers Gowtham and Koushik.
Finally, a 63-run partnership between captain Vasavada and Sakariya took the 2019-20 Ranji champions within sniffing distance of victory, before the latter departed at 24.
Vasavada and new batter Prerak Mankad (7 not out) ensured no more hiccups as Saurashtra set up a title clash with Bengal.

Vasavada was adjudged “Player of the Match” for his composed 202 off 406 balls in the first innings and a match-winning 51-ball 47 under trying circumstances in the second innings.

India vs Australia: Uncapped spinner Mathew Kuhnemann has a ‘live chance’ of playing 2nd Test: Andrew McDonald,"Kuhnemann, 26, will be joining the touring party in place of leg-spinner Swepson who will make a pre-planned return home for the birth of his first child.","Uncapped Australia left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann, who is flying in for Mitchell Swepson, has a “live chance” to make his debut in the second Test against India starting here on February 17 if the visitors opt for three spinners, said coach Andrew McDonald.
Kuhnemann, 26, will be joining the touring party in place of leg-spinner Swepson who will make a pre-planned return home for the birth of his first child.
Swepson, however, is set to return to India ahead of the third Test.
“He’s (Kuhnemann) a live chance to play in the next Test match,” McDonald was quoted as saying by cricinfo on Sunday.
“If we play three spinners then we clearly want back-up here and available in the squad if that’s the way we want to go.” Kuhnemann doesn’t have international experience under his belt, having scalped just 35 wickets at 34.80 in 13 first-class matches.
Kuhnemann was “shocked” to get the news.
“Got a phone call yesterday morning when walking out for the warm-ups. Was pretty shocked,” Kuhnemann said after Queensland’s Sheffield Shield match against Victoria.
“I was just lucky enough that my passport was in my bag. I watched every day (of the first Test) just being such a fan. These series are so good to watch. Todd Murphy was exceptional and sort of watched how (Ravindra) Jadeja bowled. So just really excited to get over there.

“I was fortunate enough to stay with the Test guys and bowl to them in the nets in Sri Lanka, so that’s still pretty fresh in my memory. I learned heaps just being over there for a couple (of) months. If I got the opportunity I’d like to think I’d be okay,” he added.
Meanwhile, McDonald is hopeful about Cameron Green’s availability for the second Test.
The young all-rounder is recovering from a broken finger he suffered against South Africa at the MCG last December.
“We’re hopeful. It’s been six weeks now. I think he’s actually got his final X-ray or scan today. He does allow us different options to the way that we want to structure up,” McDonald said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Pacer Mitchell Starc, who missed the first Test, has arrived here after recovering from a finger injury he also sustained in Melbourne.
“(Starc) will have a rest day today (in Delhi) and then he’ll train tomorrow on his own up there,” McDonald said.
“A couple of the staff members will go up there. We’re hopeful that both of those are back on the selection table and that would change the balance of our side.” McDonald, however, informed that Josh Hazlewood won’t be available for the second Test after missing the series opener due to an Achilles issue.
“He’s close. So I think it’s just probably the load in that Achilles,” McDonald said.
“We just don’t want to push it. He’s going to have three days off and then have a main bowl if he gets through that.” McDonald defended the team management’s decision to go with Matt Renshaw in place of Travis Head, a selection which raised a few eyebrows. The coach, however, said Renshaw failed to live up to the expectations.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We valued others’ skill-sets in those extreme conditions. I think the discussion point that we went through in the process will be different to the hindsight. And the hindsight is that those people that you will compare the competition for place around didn’t perform the way that we’d probably expected,” he said.
“(Head) had different thoughts on that and that’s fair enough. And he’s entitled to have different thoughts on that along with others. And we’re not saying any decision that we make is right or wrong.

This allowed his teammate to catch the ball inside the ground. The crowd watching the game were awestruck by the effort and applauded the brilliance.

Southampton sack Nathan Jones with club in last place,Jones is the second Saints manager to lose his job this season after the former Luton Town boss was appointed in November as Ralph Hasenhuettl's replacement.,"Southampton parted ways with manager Nathan Jones on Sunday after the Welshman won just one Premier League game during his three-month tenure at the south-coast club.
Jones is the second Saints manager to lose his job this season after the former Luton Town boss was appointed in November as Ralph Hasenhuettl’s replacement.
While the Saints reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and the semi-finals of the League Cup, the club failed to get out of the relegation zone in the league and remain rooted at the bottom of the table.
In their last eight league games, Southampton’s sole victory came against a similarly struggling Everton last month.
Jones’s last game in charge was Saturday’s defeat by 10-man Wolverhampton Wanderers who came back from a goal down to win 2-1 to leave the Saints on 15 points in 22 games, four points from the safety zone.

"I’m confident and positive, says fit-again PV Sindhu ahead of Badminton Asia Mixed Team Championship","PV Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medallist, said her injury has ""completely healed"" and is aiming to go full throttle this year.","Completely recovered from a stress fracture on the left foot that kept her away from the circuit for five months, a fit-again Indian shuttler PV Sindhu is confident and sounding positive ahead of the ongoing season.
Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medallist, said her injury has “completely healed” and is aiming to go full throttle this year.
Sindhu was sidelined with injury after winning the Commonwealth Games women’s singles gold in Birmingham in August and made a comeback at the year’s first event — Petronas Malaysia Open 2023 — where she lost a three-gamer in the opening round to Carolina Marin of Spain.
Sindhu made another first-round exit a week later at the India Open at home, but said she was “happy with my footwork, skills and strokes” on her return to competitive action in Kuala Lumpur.
“I’m completely alright now. Physically and mentally I’m completely fine. Injuries happen but it’s important to keep your body healthy and come back stronger every time. I am confident, positive and learning from my mistakes,” the 27-year-old told Badminton World Federation.
“My parents were athletes too. The support and motivation they give me keep me going during low moments.” Sindhu, who bagged three titles — Syed Modi India International, Swiss Open and Singapore Open last year — hopes to replicate her success at the HSBC BWF World Tour this season.
“I hope it will be,” said the world No.9 shuttler.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You also have to be 100 per cent but I’m completely recovered now. It takes time to get into that rhythm and play tournament matches. I’m on track.” Along with Lakshya Sen and HS Prannoy, Sindhu will spearhead India’s challenge at the Badminton Asia Mixed Team Championships starting Tuesday in Dubai.

Fit-again Afridi to lead defending champions Lahore in PSL,Afridi led Lahore to its maiden PSL title last year in Pakistan's premier domestic Twenty20 tournament that has once again attracted several foreign T20 specialists in a six-team event,"Shaheen Shah Afridi will stage a comeback to competitive cricket after three months out with a freak knee injury to lead defending champions Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League, beginning from Monday.
Afridi led Lahore to its maiden PSL title last year in Pakistan’s premier domestic Twenty20 tournament that has once again attracted several foreign T20 specialists in a six-team event also featuring two-time champions Islamabad United and past winners Multan Sultans, Karachi Kings, Quetta Gladiators and Peshawar Zalmi.
Afridi, the lanky left-arm fast bowler, has been Pakistan’s bowling mainstay for the last five years since making his international debut in 2018. But a knee injury during the final of the T20 World Cup against England saw him undergo a long strenuous rehabilitation program before finally getting ready for the PSL.
“There were times when I wanted to give up,” Afridi said.
“I was working on only one muscle and it was not improving. Often during the rehabilitation sessions, I used to say to myself this is enough, I cannot do this anymore.'” Afridi used to watch his bowling videos on YouTube to keep himself motivated and push a little more’ but was frustrated to miss international cricket because of injury.
In Afridi’s absence England whitewashed Pakistan 3-0 in the test series during its historic comeback tour to Pakistan last December, while New Zealand twice came close to beating Pakistan in the drawn two-test series.
Afridi, who has a tendency of picking up wickets in the batting powerplay, has taken 70 wickets since making his PSL debut during the third edition of the tournament in 2018. He is third behind his countrymen Wahab Riaz (103), who is the only bowler in the PSL history with over 100 wickets, and Hasan Ali (81).

“PSL is one of the best leagues in the world and the quality of cricket tests you as a bowler,” Afridi said.
“I am very excited to be making my comeback here … I am ticking both the bowling workload and fitness requirement boxes.” Lahore might rue the absence of hard-hitting England batter Harry Brook, who will be on national duty while star leg-spinner Rashid Khan will also miss the first three games due to his commitment with the Afghanistan national team.
However, Lahore has drafted in Englishman Sam Billings and West Indian Shai Hoe to bolster its batting line-up which has the experience of Fakhar Zaman upfront.
The combination of Afridi and Haris Rauf forms the best pace bowling pair in the PSL with the latter having the capability to tie down batters in the latter half of the innings with his pace and impeccable line and length.

Pakistan all-format skipper Babar Azam, who won the ICC’s ODI cricketer of the year award for the second successive year, had a forgettable last year in the PSL when his team Karachi Kings could win only one of the 10 league games.
This year Babar will be leading Peshawar Zalmi after he was traded to Karachi while T20 veteran Shoaib Malik and young middle-order batter Haider Ali were traded from Peshawar to Karachi.
Karachi has the experience of Mohammad Amir in its bowling ranks and has also drafted Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade and fast bowler Andrew Tye. Although Englishman James Vince might not be available for the entire tournament, left-handed opener Sharjeel Khan will need to shoulder more of the burden of scoring in the absence of Babar.
Sri Lanka’s Bhanuka Rajapaksa has bolstered Peshawar’s middle-order with young wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Haris and West Indian duo of Rovman Powell and Sherfane Rutherford also among their ranks.
ADVERTISEMENT
Islamabad, winners of the first two of the three editions of the tournament, is a team which believes in match-ups and relies heavily on data to find a winning edge. Led by Shadab Khan, Islamabad has power-hitters in Paul Stirling and Asif Ali with young Azam Khan also making good progress in the T20 format after hitting a century in the recent Caribbean Premier League.
Hasan and Faheem Ashraf are its experienced fast bowlers with Shadab tying down the batters with his legbreak bowling in the middle overs.
Multan got beaten in the final last year and will open the PSL at home against Lahore on Monday.
South African pair of Rilee Rossouw and David Miller, Shan Masood and skipper Mohammad Rizwan carry enough experience in the batting lineup, but its bowling resources look thin this year with Shahnawaz Dahani and tall leg-spinner Usama Mir likely to carry the bowling burden.
It has beefed up the team in the replacement draft by drafting in globe-trotter T20 specialist Kieron Pollard of the West Indies.
Veteran Sarfaraz Ahmed will be leading Quetta Gladiators for the eighth successive season after failing to qualify for the final in the last three editions since it won the tournament in 2019.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sarfaraz is expected to bat higher in the order and has got a red-hot Iftikhar Ahmed also in the ranks. Iftikhar hit six sixes in an over against Peshawar Zalmi’s Riaz during an exhibition PSL match last week in Quetta and also made his mark in this season’s Bangladesh Premier League.

Just regression, not progression. Not much changed in his 19th innings too, though he tried his best.
He just about managed to survive the pacers’ opening spells with stabs. Siraj harassed him with his bouncers at the body, the elbow bled, the helmet grill clanged. Shami came for his second spell and picked up the bouncer weapon before doing him with the old trick. The ball that angles out from round the stumps, too good for Warner.

India vs Australia: David Warner’s position in jeopardy for Delhi Test,IND vs AUS: David Warner’s poor batting in the first Test could now see him be replaced by Travis Head for the upcoming Test match in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in New Delhi.,"IND vs AUS: Australian opener David Warner might be in danger of losing out on his position to Travis Head in the second Test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy in New Delhi after two poor outings in the first Test at Nagpur.
Warner’s double failure was part of Australia’s overall three-day period of gloom and doom where their bowling unit was unable to hold down India’s middle and lower order and then their batting unit capitulated on the third day to Ravichandran Ashwin. Both Ashwin and Jadeja completed the first Test with 15 of the 20 wickets taken between them – a testament to the sheer quality of bowling available to India at the moment.
Former Australian skipper Mark Taylor believed that the call to drop Warner should be delayed and that the opener should be given at least one more game to avoid the axe.
“David’s been around long enough, and I know he’s had plenty of opportunities [but] I think you’ve got to give him at least the next Test match to get it right,” Taylor told Wide World of Sports. “As Warner and Usman Khawaja found out today, they bat at the top of the order and faced Ravi Ashwin with the new ball, and then four overs later got Ravi Jadeja. So, it doesn’t really matter where you bat; you’re going to face the same stuff. So, I would be sticking with the top two at the moment.”
Warner had previously gone through 20 Test innings’ with just one half-century to his name. Then the Melbourne Boxing Day Test match against South Africa took place. In that game, Warner, who was in the midst of a push to become the Australian skipper, scored an epic double hundred – one that made it believe that the left-hander was well and truly back to his best.
Warner’s possible replacement in Head has a poor track record in the sub-continent, averaging 21 in seven Tests. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian hierarchy believes that Head’s ‘explosive batting’ could come into play against pace and the harder new ball on Indian wickets.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-david-warners-position-in-jeopardy-for-delhi-test-8439978/,sports

"IND vs AUS: Nagpur Test exposed Australia’s weakness against spin, need to adapt quickly, says Ian Chappell",Spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja bamboozled Australia on a typical red-soil wicket as the visitors crumbled to their lowest total in India -- 91 -- to suffer an innings defeat inside three days in Nagpur on Saturday.,"The legendary Ian Chappell feels Australia’s capitulation in the first Test against India has exposed their frailties against spin, and said the touring Pat Cummins-led side needs to adapt to the conditions quickly.
He asked Australia to stop thinking about pitches in India and just concentrate on their job.
Spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja bamboozled Australia on a typical red-soil wicket as the visitors crumbled to their lowest total in India — 91 — to suffer an innings defeat inside three days in Nagpur on Saturday.
“The first Test has exposed Australia’s weakness against good spin bowling on turning pitches,” the former Australian captain wrote in his column for ESPNCricinfo.
“If they can ensure this setback doesn’t mean their mental capacity to cope in India is not dented, it will keep them in the series. If they waver, they are in big trouble,” Chappell added.
India faced typical pitch doctoring allegations in the build-up to the Nagpur Test but the Australian batting great opined that it was “by no means impossible to play on.” “The noise was exactly that in the case of the pitch. Not unexpectedly, it turned out to be nothing more than a fairly typical first-day Indian red-soil wicket,” Chappell wrote.
“It was by no means impossible to play on, as Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith showed, but Australia failed to post a testing first-innings total.

“The media making allegations about pitch-doctoring is nothing new. Players need to ignore this little game or else it has a debilitating effect on the visiting team.
“Far too much emphasis is put on how pitches are going to play and on doctoring. It’s worth remembering that both teams have to play on the same pitch,” he added.
He said India currently boast of a strong side and has the ability to win in any conditions.
“The reality is that India have developed into a very strong side all round the world, with a special feel for how to win at home,” the 79-year-old wrote.
ADVERTISEMENT
Citing example of Rohit Sharma’s “masterful” century that took India to 400 in the first innings, he wrote: “If Australia, who have a weakness against spin in India, don’t adapt to conditions quickly, they are going to suffer the same fate that has befallen other visiting sides.”

Chappell further questioned the omission of off-spin all-rounder Travis Head.
“The omission of Travis Head, despite his troubles against good spinners, was difficult to fathom. The choice of off-spinner Todd Murphy in his first Test after only seven first-class games was brave. Nevertheless it also displayed great faith in Murphy’s skills,” he wrote.
“In the end the choice Australia made, to favour economy over wicket-taking potential, quickly took its toll and India capitalised on bowlers tiring from a heavy workload,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-nagpur-test-exposed-australias-weakness-against-spin-need-to-adapt-quickly-says-ian-chappell-8439914/,sports

Australia conjured 177 in their first innings, but then conceded 400 runs to India’s batting line-up – particularly to Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, who scored 70 and 84 runs respectively. They then crumbled on the third day, falling to an innings defeat after only being able to stitch up 91 runs in their second innings.
Speaking about the loss, Cummins reiterated the faith the team management had that the best players available were chosen.

“We were confident it was our best XI this week,” Cummins said post-game. We know the quality Trav (Travis Head) is. He’s a huge part of this team but we were confident in the 11 guys out there. He’s been really good around the group. He’s been out the back working really hard on his game like he always does,” said the Aussie captain to Sen.com.au.
Cummins also spoke about how Australia will try to put the loss at Nagpur behind them. Part of his reasoning was that losses of this magnitude can often be easier to put behind and that Australia needed to identify which issues to work on and make larger strides in those areas.

James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho and Harvey Barnes also netted for the hosts and Leicester scored four for the second straight game.

Arsenal stumbles again in 1-1 draw with Brentford in EPL
Arsenal’s grip on the English Premier League lead is suddenly looking shaky.
The Gunners were held by Brentford to 1-1 at Emirates Stadium on Saturday, dropping points for the second game in a row and giving Manchester City renewed hope of overtaking them atop the table.

The result means City can cut Arsenal’s lead to three points with a home win over Aston Villa on Sunday. With Arsenal then hosting City on Wednesday, Pep Guardiola’s team would go top on goal difference if it wins both matches — although the Gunners have played one game less.
Leandro Trossard’s first Arsenal goal gave the hosts the lead in the 66th minute when he steered in a cross from Bukayo Saka. But Ivan Toney equalized with a close-range header eight minutes later after the Gunners failed to clear a free kick.
Coming off a 1-0 loss at Everton last weekend, Arsenal looked flat again for much of the game and was even fortunate not to be behind at the break as Brentford wasted two great chances.
Toney’s cross from the right evaded Arsenal defenders to give Rico Henry an opportunity to score into an open net, but the full back couldn’t make clean contact with the ball and it sailed wide.

Toney then nearly scored in the 25th after Bryan Mbeumo teed him up inside the area, but the striker’s shot hit the corner of the goal frame.
With Arsenal’s attack sputtering, Trossard came off the bench to provide a much-needed spark. The former Brighton forward, who joined Arsenal in the January transfer window, was on hand at the far post to slot the ball into an empty net after being picked out by Saka.
But the lead didn’t last long.
After Arsenal couldn’t clear an in swinging free kick into the area, Brentford kept the ball alive with three straight headers before Christian Norgaard squared the ball across the goalmouth, where Toney had an easy header into an empty net. The Brentford celebrations were put on hold for a lengthy VAR check for a possible offside before the goal was allowed to stand.

Mumbai City clinch ISL League Shield after 5-3 win over FC Goa,"In the second half, Mumbai City FC tightened up to nullify FC Goa, forcing the home side to take risks going forward, which helped Chhangte in particular to come into the game. ","Mumbai City FC beat FC Goa 5-3 in a thrilling match to clinch the ISL League Shield with two matches in hand on Saturday.
FC Goa were determined not to make Mumbai’s title charge easy, trying to beat them with their own attacking method. They found success with this approach as early as in the fifth minute.
A long free kick found its way to Noah Sadaoui, who dodged past three defenders and found the target to put FC Goa ahead.
But the league leaders weren’t quiet for long. In the 18th minute, they were gifted a free kick just outside the box in a central position. Greg Stewart stepped up and hit a powerful left-footed shot to Dheeraj Singh’s near post to beat his outstretched right hand.
Both teams continued to push forward and looked shaky in defence, and in a four-minute span before the break, the game exploded into life.
In the 40th minute, Diaz was found with a good low delivery from Lallianzuala Chhangte on the right and hooked the ball from the floor to put the Islanders in front.
Their joy was short-lived, as FC Goa caught them out with a long ball again. Sadaoui turned creator, finding Brandon Fernandes’ run with a lob over the defence to put him one-on-one with Phurba Lachenpa. Fernandes made no mistake with his first touch and the hosts were level again.

But Stewart was on hand again to put Mumbai City FC in front with his second free-kick of the game, this one a more gentle curling effort that bounced off the post into the goal.
In the second half, Mumbai City FC tightened up to nullify FC Goa, forcing the home side to take risks going forward, which helped Chhangte in particular to come into the game.
In the 71st minute, the winger found space for a cross which was handled in the box by Anwar Ali. He stepped up to take it himself to get to double-figures in the season and put the game beyond FC Goa.
By the 77th minute, the Islanders had both Chhangte and Stewart off the pitch, but the substitutes ran circles around FC Goa anyway.

From a corner, Mourtada Fall headed the ball into Vikram Pratap Singh’s path in front of the goal, and he flicked it in to make it 5-2.
Against the run of play, Brison Fernandes found the back of the net from Alvaro Vazquez’s pull back, but the show would stop with that eighth goal.
With first place sealed, Mumbai City FC will travel to Bengaluru FC on February 15. FC Goa remain in fifth place but within touching distance of Odisha FC and Bengaluru FC.

Arpit Vasavada follows Pujara school of batsmanship to put Saurashtra on brink of Ranji final,Left-hander hits double ton as Karnataka left to chase the game on the final day,"Frustrated at their inability to get him out, Karnataka fielders decided to sledge Saurashtra captain Arpit Vasavada. “Six toh maar, kitna six ab tak mara hai, bhai? Record improve kar (Hit a six, how many have you hit till now, brother? Improve your record).”
But not once did Vasavada react. Probably, the Karnataka players didn’t know that the left-handed batsman hails from the same school of batsmanship as Cheteshwar Pujara. Pujara’s father Arvind also coached Vasavada. Hence, it was no surprise that after a while, the fielders gave up, realising there was no point wasting energy on him.

IND vs AUS: Why Ashwin out bowled Nathan Lyon,"IND vs AUS: Ashwin is better skilled at sizing up the pace, length, trajectory that works on a particular pitch.","IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma summed up the craft of Ravi Ashwin candidly: “He looks a different bowler every time he plays Test cricket.” The statement should not be misconstrued as the off-spinner’s streak of experimentalism, his tendency to bowl with different actions, or his penchant for variations. He was simply referring to how Ashwin displays a new layer to his art in every Test, how he keeps evolving, how in a sense he is still a student of the game, even after collecting 457 Tests wickets. He is already a glittering diamond, but he continues to polish himself so that he shines brighter. “You see him, he is getting better and better every time you see him.”

Therein lies the soul of Ashwin’s success too—his astonishing hunger to pick new shades of the game, to master new tricks, to invent new methods, his mind forever browsing to pick new variations. He picked carrom ball from a guy playing tennis-ball in the neighbourhood; he then grasped the reverse carrom from Sachithra Senanayake; in between nuanced the slider and top-spinner, would experiment with his seam and bowl seam-up, would occasionally bowl leg-spin, more as a statement when India were obsessed with wrist-spin in white-ball cricket. So much so that he is cricket’s equivalent of the Ulysses, in a perennial voyage to new shores of wisdom. There perhaps is nothing he can’t do—ask him to bowl left-arm spin, he would perhaps bowl with the left-arm too.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-why-ashwin-out-bowled-nathan-lyon-8439348/,sports
Watch: VAR misses handball as Chelsea draw 1-1 at West Ham,"Chelsea appealed in vain for a penalty, claiming substitute Conor Gallagher's shot was stopped by Soucek's hand.","Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw at West Ham United on Saturday as Joao Felix’s opener was cancelled out by ex-Blues defender Emerson Palmieri, leaving Graham Potter’s expensively assembled team still a long way from a top-four spot.
Felix, returning to the team after the on-loan Portuguese winger was sent off in his Chelsea debut last month, side-footed home in the 16th minute after a pinpoint pass by British record signing Enzo Fernandez, one of Stamford Bridge’s many new faces.
Chelsea sought to extend their lead but it was their former wing-back Emerson who equalised in the 28th minute when he arrived unmarked at the far post to meet a headed flick-on by Jarrod Bowen and shoot past Kepa Arrizabalaga.
In a second half of few chances, Tomas Soucek put the ball in the back of the net in the 82nd minute but Declan Rice, who headed the ball on to the Czech, was ruled offside by VAR.
A few minutes later, Chelsea appealed in vain for a penalty, claiming substitute Conor Gallagher’s shot was stopped by Soucek’s hand.

The draw meant Chelsea have now won only one of their last seven league games – and they have not won away since October. They stayed ninth in the table, nine points behind fourth-placed Newcastle who have played a game less.
Chelsea coach Potter said he saw positives in the performance of his players, especially in the first half when the Blues, as well as scoring through Felix, had the ball in the back of the net twice but both were ruled out for offside.
“It was a step forward for us in terms of the previous game and lots to go forward with,” he told BT Sport.

“We had real control of the game and it was a cheap goal from our perspective. That lifts the crowd and makes it more difficult but that is something we have to manage better. We will get better from the experience.”

West Ham manager David Moyes said he was happy that his side survived Chelsea’s early dominance.

"Women’s T20 World Cup: Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh, who are Tendulkar and Dhoni fans, will spearhead India against Pakistan","Fresh from the euphoria of winning the U-19 World Cup, India will bank on their explosive teenagers to deliver at the senior level.","There are uncanny similarities between Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh. Both are nursing their father’s shattered cricketing dreams. They spent most of their childhood watching and listening to cricket stories from their fathers. At Rohtak, Sanjeev never pursued his dream due to financial constraints, whereas in Siliguri, Manabendra Ghosh never made it beyond the club level.
Interestingly, their cricketing journey started after watching cricketing gods — Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni. For Shafali, it all started when she watched Sachin Tendulkar’s last Ranji Trophy match at Lahli. For Richa, it started after watching MS Dhoni’s World Cup winning six from her hometown in Siliguri.
Around three years back in front of a packed MCG, they suffered heartbreak in the Women’s T20 World Cup final. A couple of weeks ago, the duo helped India to lift the inaugural U-19 Women’s World Cup.
On Sunday India will start their World Cup campaign on Sunday against their arch-rivals Pakistan and in the absence of Smriti Mandhana, India will be banking on their explosive teenagers to step up at the senior level.
Their power-hitting is very natural, and that’s what caught the attention of their respective coaches – Shib Shankar Paul and Ashwani Kumar.
“Richa can hit sixes at will. She can just stand and hit it out of the park. Her strength is very natural. At present, she is one of the cleanest strikers in this Indian cricket team,” Paul, a former Bengal and India A medium pacer, told The Indian Express.
“She likes Dhoni because of his six-hitting prowess,” he added.

“The heartbreak of 2020 is not healed yet, but winning the U-19 title was a big confidence booster for Shafali. She has got the taste of winning. For any athlete, there is no better thing than the habit of winning. It is a team game and I believe this Indian team can go all the way, considering their talent and depth in the squad,” said Sanjeev.
Both Kumar and Paul have one concern about their wards’ eagerness to hit every ball for a boundary.
“With time she will realise that she can’t hit every ball for a four or six. To keep the bowler under the pump is her game, she has terrorised the world’s best bowlers, but at the same time you can’t throw away a good start. She is still 19 and called it an exuberance of youth, but that’s her game and that keeps me on edge. In recent times, she has worked on her strike rotation, which I must say is a pleasing development,” Kumar, a former Haryana Ranji Trophy coach, had said.

On the other hand, Paul, a bowler himself, feels at crunch moments, Richa must play with calculated aggression. “Being brave is great but you must win the battle. What is the point if she scores an 8-ball 15 and ends up on the losing side. I want her to be calculative in her approach, because her role in the team is as a finisher. I have been telling her this everytime we train or talk – to be patient and that it is okay to play a couple of dot balls,” said Paul.
Mandhana ruled out, Harmanpreet fit to play
Opener Smriti Mandhana has been ruled out of the team’s opening Women’s T20 World Cup game against Pakistan on Sunday as she is “still recovering” from a finger injury that she picked up while fielding during the warm-up game against Australia earlier this week.
“Smriti has a finger injury and is still (in) recovery, so she won’t play, most likely. It’s not a fracture and we’re hopeful she will be available from the second game onwards,” coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar said during a press conference.
Captain Harmanpreet Kaur has recovered fully from the shoulder niggle she picked up during the Tri-series.

"Devil in their minds: Pre-occupied by pitch talks, Australia’s abject surrender was of their own making","IND vs AUS: The visitors' second innings, and the third day overall, was a lament on the fabled virtues of indefatigability and tenacity that, in different eras, made them a touchstone of cricketing success.","IND vs AUS: Moments after Mohammed Shami had ended the gruesome ordeal of Australia’s batsmen, their feeble resistance consuming merely 139 minutes, the ground staff huddled beside the pitch, laughing and chatting under the balmy Nagpur sun. One of them pulled out a smartphone and captured a selfie with the strip on the back-drop, before they soon began to broom the surface, kicking up plumes of brown dust that swirled and whirled in the air.
Fay away stood Pat Cummins and his teammates, still peering painfully into the surface that would remain an emblem of not only their ineptitude at playing quality spin but also their uncharacteristic lack of fight, defeated not so much by the imagined devils on the surface as by their own fragilities, of technique and temperament, mind and body.
What would concern Australia as they pick up their shattered pieces of the defeat from the ripping dust as they look to bounce back from the series, more than their elaborate plans, detailed preparations, and how they could not implement them, would be the utter lack of resolve they demonstrated. Their second innings, and the third day overall, was a lament on the fabled virtues of indefatigability and tenacity that, in different eras, made them a touchstone of cricketing success. This day cannot be brushed aside as an aberration, or that one bad off day in the office kind, but one that requires earnest soul-searching if they are to make a comeback and not end up packing their bags in humiliation.

The moment they lumbered onto the field in the morning, they walked like no-hopers, as though the match was beyond them. The lines erred, the lengths faltered, catches slipped out of the hands, runs burst through the palms, they seemed like a flea market counterfeit of an unsold painting. There was no energy, belief or even hope, as they let Axar Patel and Mohammed Shami freewheel in the morning to an unsurpassable total.
The unravelling of their batting could be foretold from their body language on the field. It took Ravi Ashwin only five balls to trigger a harrowing evening. A simple but basic two-card trick. He floated a full ball that he drove emphatically through covers, before the masterful off-spinner just pulled back the length a fraction, purchased hypnotic inward drift into his body and coaxed him into step out, stretch forward and drive away from his body. The ball dropped further than Khawaja had judged, he was too committed to the stroke to readjust, then it spun away from him to graze the inside edge of a hideous swipe to Virat Kohli at first slip. The imprudence of the stroke would haunt him, more than the execution.
This would be the recurring theme of Australia’s meltdown. There was neither purpose nor plans, as though disillusioned by the rigorous pre-series planning. Even the usually organised Marnus Labuschagne could not work his way out of the mess. Ravindra Jadeja deliberately slowed himself down—he consumed more time than usual between deliveries, floated rather than fizzed the ball, pounded the good rather than the full-length zones, giving Labuschagne a false confidence that he could defend comfortably on the back-foot. How unusually naive of the Australian batsmen to not second-guess his intentions. He was baited into defending on the back-foot to a quicker and flatter ball that barely rose above the shin. He could pin the blame on the pitch, that it did not bounce, but he could have averted the dismissal had he played the ball forward.

Soon after, Warner too stooped to a similar folly. Ashwin foxed him with a three-card trick. Two full floated balls that Warner slapped boundaries, allaying his doubts against his regular tormentor, later came the under-cutter that slithered like a freed snake onto his pads. Warner preempted a half-prod, which in itself is a cardinal mistake in this neck of the woods and was caught on the pads. To think that this was Warner’s third tour to India, and yet he looked as clueless as a first-timer, baffles the mind.
This was no group of novices. All the top seven, barring Marnus Labuschagne and Alex Carey, had played Test cricket here. Of them, Labuschagne tops the ICC batting charts. Matthew Renshaw had knocked a brace of 60s in his previous tour to India, but he seemed a man that had just escaped a train wreck, lasting just seven balls in both innings combined. Both times he was trapped in front, and both times his leaden-footed defensive thrust was the culprit. The initial shuffle across forced him to play around the front pad. Peter Handscomb, one of the heroes of the Ranchi draw in 2017, aimlessly thrust his front-foot to thwart an Ashwin slider from around the stumps. A shot that was more a sign of tactical inflexibility than technical capability.
Alex Carey’s dismissal could be foreseen even before he strode to the middle. He would sweep and reverse-sweep to glory, some are bound to fetch him boundaries, but one ball would have his name scribbled on it. For Ashwin and Co are far craftier than to be spooked by a single shot. It was just a matter of time before Ashwin marinated him before barbecuing him. A full, fast ball did the trick. His ploy was suicidal, to say the least, as one-trick obsession hardly pays. As good a line-dishevelling tactic as the sweep and its variants are, one string in a bow does not suffice in the country. Some of the most successful overseas players in Asia have deployed the sweep to stinging effect, but all of them possessed robust defensive techniques as well.

Ten lbws and four bowled tell its own story, of the inflexibility of feet, the stiffness of hands and rigidity of tactics, exposing their false conquest of Asia. The Test series win in Pakistan arrived on mostly flat decks, and the drawn series in Sri Lanka came against a perennially transitioning team, their mind numbed by the larger economic crisis of the country. India were a different beast, and Australia’s inadequacies made the adversaries look even more fearsome.

To blame the pitch is churlish. In the end, Cummins admitted as much. But the batsmen couldn’t hide their fear of the pitch. Every time a wicket fell, they peered suspiciously at the wicket. There were no devils. Rather, they were bedevilled by the look of the pitch rather than how it eventually played out. The loose patch outside the left-hander’s off-stump that Steve Smith feared would crack open never did. The masters of the mind game were victims of the fears and doubts their own minds infested. Beneath the snarling, gnarling exteriors brood vulnerability.
Jadeja would later rub salt onto their gaping wounds. “I feel they were seeing the rough from the moment they sat on the flight. The atmosphere they created that it would spin; it didn’t spin that much. If we see, they got out more to straight balls. We also got out lbw on straight balls,” he told BCCI.tv.
Unless they shed the fear of turners and self-inflicted prejudices, it does not matter who their reinforcements would be in Delhi or after that. They could hope that Cameron Greene and the pace pair of Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc win their race against fitness, but it would amount to nothing unless they summon back the old virtues of guts and grit in the remaining Tests. By the time they departed to the hotels, the groundsmen had begun exhuming the pitch. Australia too would need to exorcise the demons of this game and realise that the demons were not on the surface, but their minds. And from there they should start their journey of redemption.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-pitch-talks-australias-surrender-of-their-own-making-8439237/,sports

“Every one of them is near a milestone. There’s like a milestone every day. Someone is taking 5 wickets, someone takes 250 wickets, someone takes 450 wickets. So every day, someone or the other is getting to a milestone,” he said as everyone around him laughed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-rohit-sharma-on-how-his-bowlers-react-near-a-milestone-8439145/,sports
"Captaining Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in India is like leading Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc in Australia, says Rohit Sharma",Rohit also said he had picked up a few cues about how to work with spinners from his predecessor Virat Kohli's time as a skipper.,"India skipper Rohit Sharma gave a huge compliment to India’s spin-bowling pair of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, saying that leading them was similar to captaining Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc in Australia.
Ashwin and Jadeja scripted Australia’s collapse in the opening Test here as India took a 1-0 lead in the Border-Gavaskar series, defeating the visitors by an innings and 132 runs. Rohit also said that the Indian pair always aim to “reach the next level” while paying Tests.
“He (Ashwin) looks a different bowler. I wouldn’t say an improved bowler as he was always a good bowler but he looks a different bowler every time he plays Test cricket. That’s what good cricketers do. They try and up their game and try to reach the next level,” said Rohit.
Ashwin, who reached a personal milestone of 450 wickets in Test cricket, also picked up his 31st five-for and a match haul of eight wickets.
Asked about the feeling of captaining a side that has Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar Patel in its ranks, Rohit replied, “It’s like captaining (Pat) Cummins, (Josh) Hazlewood and (Mitchell) Starc in Australia. Pretty similar. When you have the quality of Axar, Jadeja, and Ash, having played in India for so many years, playing on pitches like these, it’s always a blessing.” Rohit, who scored a century and laid the platform for a 400-run total, said pitch conditions are the same for everyone but what makes the three India spinners special is their ability to extract the maximum out of the wicket.
“Conditions are there for everyone but what they extract from those conditions make them really, really special. They have played on these pitches a lot and they know which areas to hit, how to keep applying that pressure.”
Learnings from Kohli
Rohit also said he had picked up a few cues about how to work with spinners from his predecessor Virat Kohli’s time as a skipper.
ADVERTISEMENT
“When Virat was captaining, I noticed one thing, no matter if we got a wicket or not, the pressure had to be there so that the opposition made a mistake.
“That’s what I learnt when Virat was captaining and these guys were bowling. That’s what I try to do now. Apply pressure and don’t expect wickets every ball; its not going to happen like that but if it happens, nothing like it. We’ve got to be at it, and keep putting the ball in right areas and let the pitch help you.”
Juggling three seasoned pros
Often, when there are three spinners in the side, one tends to get under-bowled. Rohit tickled a funny bone when he cited his “worries” while rotating the bowling between Ashwin, Axar and Jadeja.
“It’s a little tough. They are all reaching their personal milestones. Jadeja was on 249 wickets and he was telling me, ‘mere ko ball de’ (give me the ball).” “Ashwin was on four wickets and he wanted a five-for and that was the challenge I was facing. I really don’t know too much about milestones but these guys know about it, so yeah that’s the challenge of captaining them rather than deciding which end to give them or not,” said Rohit as everyone had a hearty laugh.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Again the three guys are quality and, you know, whichever end is more helpful, all these spinners want to bowl from that end. But pressure is always on me to find the right end for the right one.”
What did Ashwin do and the Aussies didn’t
Ashwin had enviable match figures of 8/79 from 27.5 overs sent down in two innings. When compared with the Australian off-spin duo of Nathan Lyon (1 wicket) and Todd Murphy (7 wickets), who together sent down 96 overs, one need not scratch his head to know who is the better bowler in Indian conditions.
“Ashwin has played so much cricket in India and is closing in on playing 100 Tests (89). I am pretty sure he has played most of those Tests in India and not to forget the first-class games as well before he made his debut,” Rohit explained.
“A lot of cricket and overs have gone into skills and being able to do what he is doing now; to be able to extract something out of pitch, it is not easy.” “He can bowl that carrom ball and top spin and slider. The guy has got everything. The reason he is able to extract (so much) from the pitches is because of (the) skill-sets that he has. He is a very studious guy and likes to understand his game and take it to the next level.”
Rating the knock

Rohit might have scored one of his best Test hundreds but the captain said he will not compare his 120 at Nagpur with the 161 he scored at Chepauk against England in 2021.
“I keep it where it is,” he curtly replied, when asked where he would rank the knock among his nine Test hundreds.
“Honestly, I am not too much into rating one knock above the other. Every time you play a knock like that it is important, so it is unfair to put one knock above the other. Both have come under different circumstances.
“In Chennai, we were one Test match down, we had to win. And, especially in home conditions when you are one-down, you are under pressure to do things right.

“Both (centuries) had their own challenges and I am very happy with the two knocks.

"IND vs AUS: Nagpur pitch was difficult but not unplayable, says Pat Cummins",IND vs AUS: Indian spinners claimed 16 of the 20 Australian wickets on a pitch at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium where the ball kept low and spun unpredictably.,"IND vs AUS: Indian spinners ruled the roost in the opening test in Nagpur but the pitch was certainly not “unplayable”, Australia captain Pat Cummins said after their comprehensive defeat in the series opener on Saturday.
Indian spinners claimed 16 of the 20 Australian wickets on a pitch at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium where the ball kept low and spun unpredictably.
Cummins won an important toss but Australia could not quite vindicate his decision to bat, managing a below-par 177 in their first innings.
“I think, that first innings, the wicket spun but it wasn’t unplayable,” Cummins said after India steamrolled Australia by an innings and 132 runs inside three days.
“We’d love to get another 100 or so runs and put a bit more pressure on their first innings.”
Marnus Labuschagne made 49, while Steve Smith (37), Peter Handscomb (31) and Alex Carey (36) also got their eyes in during their first innings, yet Australia settled for a below-200 total, while India amassed 400 in their reply and did not have to bat again.
“Obviously starting is tough, but three or four of our guys got in and looked pretty comfortable out there in the first inning,” Cummins said.

“Those guys who do get in got to turn them into big scores, and other guy’s got to find a way and method to get themselves in,” he said.
While Ravindra Jadeja claimed 5-47 in Australia’s first innings, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was the wrecker-in-chief in the second claiming 5-37 to help skittle out the tourists for 91 in their second innings.
On a pitch where most other batters struggled, Rohit Sharma produced a captain’s knock of 120 to put India on course for victory.
The opener said he had overhauled his batting approach to succeed on turning tracks like in Nagpur.

“I feel you need to be slightly unorthodox. You need to use your feet, try and get to the pitch of the ball, and at the same time, try and put pressure on the bowler as well.
“You can’t let the bowler bowl six balls on the spot. You got to try and do something different… whether it’s stepping down the ground, sweeping it, reverse sweep, going over the top – there are so many things you can do.”

Smriti Mandhana will most likely not play against Pakistan: Hrishikesh Kanitkar,"""Smriti has a finger injury and is still (in) recovery, so she won't play most likely. It's not a fracture and we're hopeful she will be available from the second game onwards,"" stand-in coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar said during a press conference.","India vice-captain Smriti Mandhana was on Saturday ruled out of the team’s opening Women’s T20 World Cup game against Pakistan on Sunday as she is “still recovering” from a finger injury.
The 26-year-old Mandhana had picked up the injury while fielding during the warm-up game against Australia earlier this week, which forced her out of the second warm-up tie against Bangladesh.
“Smriti has a finger injury and is still (in) recovery, so she won’t play most likely. It’s not a fracture and we’re hopeful she will be available from the second game onwards,” stand-in coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar said during a press conference.
“You want to be playing the strong teams, the arch-rivals if you can call them that. We are totally prepared for what happens, the atmosphere is good,” added Kanitkar.
The former India men’s team cricketer added that captain Harmanpreet Kaur has recovered fully from the shoulder niggle she picked up during the Tri-series against West Indies and South Africa.
“Harman is fit to play. She has batted for the last two days in the nets, she is fine,” Kanitkar added.
Earlier on Saturday, Mandhana posted her images on social media in full cricketing gear and captioned them, “Let’s go T20WorldCup2023”.

"IND vs AUS: Didn’t expect Aussies to collapse in one session, says Rohit Sharma",IND vs AUS: Australia suffered a crushing defeat by an innings and 132 runs after being all out for just 91 in their second essay in the session between lunch and tea on the third day.,"IND vs AUS: India captain Rohit Sharma won’t comment on the mental fortitude of the Australian team but certainly didn’t expect them to get bowled out in just one session on the third day of the opening Test, here on Saturday.
Australia suffered a crushing defeat by an innings and 132 runs after being all out for just 91 in their second essay in the session between lunch and tea on the third day.
“No, I didn’t,” is what the skipper said when asked if he expected the match to end well inside three days.
“We were prepared to have hard day’s bowling, spending session after session. We never thought they would get bowled out in a session.
“As you saw, the pitch became slower and slower and there was no bounce on the pitch, so it was a bit of surprise for me,” the Indian skipper said at the post-match press conference.
There was a lot of pre-match talk from the Australian media with one leading newspaper terming the Jamtha track as “systematically doctored” while other termed it “dodgy” even before a ball was bowled.
The calm Indian skipper in his own inimitable manner rubbed it in when asked if he found his team to be mentally tougher than Australia.

“I don’t know the mental status of the Australian team. I can vouch for our team and we are the ones who want to play on pitches like these and not just from now, we have been playing on pitches like these for last 3-4 years,” the skipper said.
He continued with his sarcastic way of saying things.
“Because we have all grown up playing on pitches like these, so there is no talk about pitches anymore in the changing room.” For the Indian skipper, preparation whether for a cricket match or in any aspect of life is key to success.
“I give a lot of credit to training sessions in Civil Lines before we came here. We had four or five net sessions and prepared the kind of pitch we were supposed to get here.
“Whether going down the track or sweeping, reverse sweep, hitting over top, when you prepare well, you get confidence and not just in cricket but everywhere,” he stated.

During the historic series of 2021, India came back after being shot out for 36 in the first Test. An Australian scribe asked if their team can turn it around? “It’s a good question,” Rohit said smiling wryly.
“Australia are always a good team. A lot of guys who played in that series are not there for Australia also. Australia love playing Test cricket and they take pride in representing the country and so we are quite aware of them bouncing back and what they can do as team as well.
“We want to play the cricket we are playing and we would continue to do that in three games that we have. As captain, I need to focus on what we have in Delhi and then move on from there,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-didnt-expect-aussies-to-collapse-in-one-session-rohit-sharma-8439094/,sports
Aiden Markram expresses captaincy ambitions in IPL,"""What's going to happen, to be honest… either way we back the management's decision about who they want to be in charge,"" Markram said.","One of the front-runners for Sunrisers Hyderabad’s captaincy in IPL-16, South African batter Aiden Markram is ready to take up the challenge if given a chance.
Besides Markram, seasoned opener Mayank Agarwal and veteran India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar are the other candidates in fray for the top job in the SRH franchise.
The 28-year-old Markram staked his claim by leading Sunrisers Eastern Cape into the final of the inaugural SA20 with a match-winning century in the last-four clash against Johannesburg Super Kings in Centurion on Thursday.
Mayank endured an unsuccessful stint as Punjab Kings captain before getting the boot. On the other hand, Markram has shown his leadership qualities by successfully leading the IPL franchise’s South African outfit.
Asked if he is open to leading the side in the high-profile Indian Premier League, Markram responded in the affirmative.
“What’s going to happen, to be honest… either way we back the management’s decision about who they want to be in charge,” Markram said.
“Becoming the captain is not the be all and end all. You can be in some form of leadership role too. But I am okay with captaincy, it’s something that I enjoy doing,” he said ahead of the SA20 final against Pretoria Capitals.

“I have been captaining for a while before this tournament started. It’s been a nice experience, a fresh start, I would say,” he added.
Mayank, who hit a double hundred in the ongoing Ranji Trophy semifinal against Saurashtra, has also brightened his chances of being named captain for the upcoming season of the T20 league.
Bhuvneshwar, 34, is SRH’s designated vice-captain and had led the side in former skipper Kane Williamson’s absence previously.
As far as Markram is concerned, the South African scored 381 runs in 14 matches at a strike rate of 139.5 last season. The only thing that could work against him is the lack of experience in leading a team in the IPL.

While Markram is entering the final on the back of a brilliant century, his opposite number, Wayne Parnell of Pretoria Capitals, has doubts over his participation in the title clash owing to a groin strain.

We’re even giving someone thumbs up ... bloody hell,” Border said.","After Australia were steamrolled by India by an innings and 132 runs on Saturday, Aussie legend Allan Border slammed the players for not playing “with a harder edge.” The incident that particularly raised Border’s ire was Steve Smith giving a thumbs up to an Indian bowler after he was beaten on the outside edge.
“Play with a harder edge. I mean, we’re giving blokes the thumbs up when they’re beating us outside the off stump,” Border said on Fox Cricket.
“What the hell is going on? That is just ridiculous. Don’t go stupid, but Australia play hard nose cricket. We’re even giving someone thumbs up … bloody hell,” he added.
The former Australia captain said that the Baggy Greens need to figure some strategy out for the rest of the series.
“There’s so many scars there now, it’s going to be a tough few days. You can talk the talk, but ultimately the boys with the bat in hand and ball in hand have got to do the job,” Border said.
“It’s going to be hard to find a way, but they’ve just got to do it. A big, soul-searching dressing room drink-a-thon tonight, just to try to thrash something out. That’s as bad as we can play, there’s only one way to go from here,” he added.

Babar has been a force to be reckoned with in 50-over cricket in recent times, still holding on to the No.1 spot on the ODI Player Rankings since July 2021 and deservedly named the ODI Player of the Year for the last two years.

Smith dropped Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja as Australia looked to bounce back in the game after being dismissed for 177 in the first innings on Thursday.
The former Australia captain dropped the Indian skipper at 118, luckily getting to watch the current Australia captain clean him up not too later. He then dropped the southpaw all-rounder on the penultimate delivery of the day.
“What a nightmare this is for a slips fieldsman,” former Australian batter Matthew Hayden said on-air. “Sort of remained unsighted there. Should have made a better effort than that. Concentration factor – second last ball of the day. Bang. Gotta be on!”
Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar also had his say on the matter, “Absolutely, he wasn’t bending low. I don’t think he was expecting the catch to come there.”He further added, “The back isn’t bent and the catch came towards the knee. So that can make the difference. Yes, it’s been a long day. It’s been a tiring day, but the last couple of deliveries is where your concentration is most tested. Tough day for Steve Smith, he’ll feel it. he’s a good catcher.”
Former Australia batter Mark Waugh, who had elaborated on the reason behind Kohli’s dropped catch of Smith on day one, added on Smith, “It’s like he doesn’t think the ball will come to him, looks away from the game. You have got to read the play. You have got to pretend you are actually batting when you are fielding at first slip to the spinners.”

Waugh further added, “Your legs have to be lot closer to be able to move quickly. Kohli was very high-up in his position. Should have stayed down a bit. He should have done a little bit better. Almost as if he wasn’t expecting it. He’s a pretty good fielder but there are a few technical things that he can work on. Those chances that dropped they both came quickly.

Zelenskyy tells summit ‘no place’ for Russia at Olympics,The International Olympic Committee argues it would be discriminatory to exclude Russia and ally Belarus from sports ahead of the 2024 Paris Games.,"Russian athletes have “no place” at next year’s Paris Olympics while their country’s invasion of Ukraine continues, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a summit of sports officials from about 30 countries Friday.
The International Olympic Committee argues it would be discriminatory to exclude Russia and ally Belarus from sports ahead of the 2024 Paris Games. With qualifying in many sports already under way, the IOC wants athletes from those countries to compete in a neutral capacity without national symbols.
“While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of the terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic competitions,” Zelenskyy told the summit in an opening address by video link, according to a transcript issued by his office.
“And it cannot be covered up with some pretended neutrality or a white flag. Because Russia is now a country that stains everything with blood — even the white flag. It must be recognized. And this must be recognized, in particular, at the level of the International Olympic Committee,” Zelenskyy said. “The International Olympic Committee needs honesty. Honesty it has unfortunately lost. Honesty that will help stop Russian terror and bring peace closer.”
Zelenskyy made surprise visits to Britain and France on Wednesday, pushing for fighter jets to battle Russian invaders in a dramatic speech to the British Parliament.
Friday’s summit meeting, which was held online and chaired by British Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, took place on a day of intense missile and drone strikes by Russian forces against Ukraine.
“President Zelenskyy told the UK in Parliament this week of the suffering still being felt by many Ukrainians. As he did so the IOC was continuing to ignore the international allies stepping up their efforts for peace and disregard how the Olympics will give (Russian President Vladimir) Putin the perfect platform to promote Russia and legitimize his illegal war,” Frazer said in a statement Thursday.

Ukrainian Sports Minister Vadym Guttsait said allowing Russians to compete would further traumatize athletes affected by the war.
“The participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions will make it impossible for Ukrainian athletes to take part in them, because each of the Ukrainians suffered from Russian aggression in one way or another: They lost their relatives and friends, lost their homes, received psychological trauma, lost the opportunity to do what they love,” Guttsait, who also leads the Ukrainian Olympic Committee, wrote in a letter to IOC president Thomas Bach and other Olympic leaders that was published Thursday.
Ukraine has previously made public a letter from Bach to Guttsait saying that “threatening a boycott … goes against the fundamentals of the Olympic Movement and the principles we stand for.”
Political leaders of Ukraine’s nearby allies in Poland and the Baltic states have said there could be Olympic boycotts if the IOC forges ahead with its plan. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has said Russian and Belarusian athletes should be barred from the Olympics in her city if the war is still going on by then.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hidalgo traveled to Kyiv on Thursday to meet Mayor Vitali Klitschko and said she would “do everything” to convince the IOC. Russian athletes previously competed at the Olympics without national symbols as punishment for doping cases, and using a similar approach to deal with a war is not appropriate, Hidalgo argued.
The IOC, which last year backed excluding Russians and Belarusians from sporting events on safety grounds, also faces challenges from within its own movement. It has given the federations running individual Olympic sports the final say on the details of readmitting Russian and Belarusian athletes. The sports could impose different rules and move at different speeds, or challenge the IOC’s authority entirely.
The governing body of archery said last week that it was “very unlikely” to allow any neutral athletes to compete in 2023, including at Olympic qualifiers. The IOC’s plan for Russians and Belarusians to qualify for the Olympics through competitions in Asia, instead of Europe, was not acceptable either, it added. The governing body of track and field has its own restrictions on the Russian team because of doping and its president, Olympic great Sebastian Coe, has said his preferred solution would be for Russia to “get out of Ukraine.”
Olympic qualifiers are under way in some sports and start soon in many more. That leaves federations to grapple with how to reshape a process that they thought was finalized years ago.
ADVERTISEMENT
It could also be up to them to implement the IOC’s plan to leave out Russian and Belarusian athletes deemed to be “actively supporting the war in Ukraine.” The IOC hasn’t defined what constitutes support, while Russian officials have called it discriminatory and demanded the Olympic body scrap that condition entirely.
Ukraine is particularly concerned that Russian athletes from military sports clubs or who hold military ranks could compete.
“In Russia, sport is an element of politics, powerful propaganda, in this case the promotion of war,” Guttsait wrote to Bach.

"Messi, Mbappe and Benzema battle for FIFA Best Player award","Argentina’s World Cup-winning captain and France’s superstar forward head the three-player shortlist announced by FIFA on Friday, eight weeks after leading their teams in an epic final in Qatar.","It’s Lionel Messi vs. Kylian Mbappé again, this time for the FIFA Best Men’s Player award for 2022.
Argentina’s World Cup-winning captain and France’s superstar forward head the three-player shortlist announced by FIFA on Friday, eight weeks after leading their teams in an epic final in Qatar.
Karim Benzema completed the top three in the voting by a global panel of national team captains and coaches plus selected journalist in each of FIFA’s 211 member countries, as well as fans voting online.
In the Best Women’s Player award, Beth Mead of England, Alex Morgan of the United States and Spain’s Alexia Putellas were on the shortlist voted for by a separate global voting panel.
The winners will be announced at a Feb. 27 ceremony in Paris.
Messi edged Mbappé for the Golden Ball awarded by FIFA as the best player at the World Cup. Croatia captain Luka Modrić placed third in that contest.
Another duel is expected for the Paris Saint-Germain teammates with Messi favored to get a seventh win in FIFA’s annual individual prize. Mbappé seeks his first.
ADVERTISEMENT
Messi won his six previous awards when it was called the FIFA World Player of the Year (2009), the FIFA Ballon d’Or in each year from 2010-12 and again in 2015, then in the current title of Best FIFA Men’s Player for 2019
Mbappe makes the shortlist for the first time though he was fourth in voting for the 2018 award. The 24-year-old has been sixth, seventh and eighth in past three years.
Robert Lewandowski won the FIFA award for the past two years.
The more prestigious Ballon d’Or award organized by France Football magazine was won in October by Karim Benzema ahead of the World Cup. The France forward missed the tournament because of an injury. Messi was not on the long list of Ballon d’Or candidates announced in August.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Best Women’s Player award for 2021 was won by Putellas and the Barcelona playmaker made the top three again despite being injured days before the European Championship and missing the tournament for Spain.
Mead led England to the Euro 2022 title as the tournament’s joint top scorer and was named its best player. She suffered a serious knee injury in November playing for Arsenal and could miss the Women’s World Cup that starts in July, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.

At the end of the first session on Day Two, Mark Waugh and Ravi Shastri were wondering why the pitch appeared to have eased out in the morning. Shastri felt it could be because the moisture had dried up from the pitch. Sunil Gavaskar felt it was the roller. “The roller makes a big difference. The roller Indians used levelled up the pitch in the first hour. That’s why we saw a couple of wickets in the second hour, a bit more turn and variable bounce etc”. It’s learnt that a light roller was used by the Indians in the morning before the start of play. It’s the prerogative of the batting captain to choose the roller he wants: heavy or light at the start of the play, according to the ICC’s playing conditions.

"‘In England, everyone is innocent until proven guilty’: Pep Guardiola responds after Man City accused of breaches",Pep Guardiola also committed his future to Manchester City despite the club being charged with alleged breaches of financial rules.,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said that his club has already been ‘condemned’ after being charged by the Premier League over alleged breaches of financial rules but at the same time reminded everyone that in England everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
City was accused on Monday of breaching a slew of financial regulations over a nine-year period. If found guilty, the club could face a fine, deduction of points or, in the most extreme case, expulsion from Premier League.
“My first thought is we are already being condemned,” Guardiola said. “We are lucky we live in a marvellous country where everyone is innocent until proved guilty. We didn’t have this opportunity. We are already sentenced.”
City already had a two-year ban from European club competitions overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2020 after UEFA had ruled the club committed “serious breaches” of financial fair play regulations from 2012-16.
“It’s the same as what happened after UEFA (charges). These are just charges. With UEFA the club proved it was completely innocent.
“We have a good lawyer, not that UEFA had bad lawyers. And I think the Premier League, supported by 19 teams, are going to take good lawyers too to defend their position.

“But if the same situation with UEFA happens and we are innocent, what happens to restore or pay back our damage?”
Guardiola also warned that other clubs should look at their own affairs before condemning Manchester City.
“What they have done to us be careful in the future because many clubs can be accused like we have been accused,” the Spanish coach said.
“That they are pushing to get rid of us out of the competition, that is obvious because they believe that we didn’t behave properly. We accept that but let us defend when we believe we did it properly.”
Guardiola also reiterated that he will remain as manager.

Championship leader Wehrlein crashes in practice session of inaugural Formula E race in India,The opening practice session was delayed by 35 minutes. The Formula E twitter handle said the delay was due to force majeure (unforeseeable circumstances) and did not specify that it was because of a dusty track.,"Championship leader Pascal Wehrlein crashed in the opening practice session of the inaugural Formula E race in India here on Friday. At the shakedown before free practice 1, the track wore a very dusty look as cars zoomed around the Hyderabad Street Circuit.
The opening practice session was delayed by 35 minutes. The Formula E twitter handle said the delay was due to force majeure (unforeseeable circumstances) and did not specify that it was because of a dusty track.
Soon after the session started, championship leader Wehrlein of Porsche Formula E team suffered a heavy crash at Turn 18, raising questions over track condition.
However, it was later revealed that a mechanical failure contributed to the crash.
“The throttle was stuck open and that led to the crash. It is normal for a street circuit to be dusty at the start. Had the slick tyres been used, grip would have been an issue but the (Hankook) tyres have a much harder compound,” a track official told PTI.
Sebastian Buemi of Envision Racing set the fastest time of the session.

UEFA president warns clubs against ‘reckless’ spending on player wages,"Europe's soccer governing body released its Benchmarking report, a review of the European football finance landscape, which highlighted how the sport is returning to normality after the economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin warned that many European clubs are “compromising their economic sustainability” due to ever-increasing player wages which have risen on average by 16% compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Europe’s soccer governing body released its Benchmarking report, a review of the European football finance landscape, which highlighted how the sport is returning to normality after the economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The report said revenue across nearly 150 clubs is up by an average of 4.6% while sponsor and commercial revenue was 13% higher than pre-pandemic levels after they missed out on seven billion euros ($7.49 billion) during the pandemic.
However, there was concern over operating costs going up by 11% while finance costs have increased 18%, with player wages being the main culprit.
“Despite the unprecedented turmoil of recent years, wages have continued to grow, rising on average by 16% compared to pre-pandemic standards,” Ceferin said.
“Top-division players’ salaries, for example, have more than doubled during the past decade.
“And while this is not a negative trend per se, it is clear that many are compromising their economic sustainability in their reckless pursuit of success.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The report showed a 108% increase in player wages over the last 10 years and they have continued to rise since 2019 despite the revenue decreases during the pandemic.
UEFA also said the January transfer window was dominated by English clubs who accounted for about 31% of global transfer activity and a whopping 53% of global transfer spending.
English clubs spent a total of 830 million euros ($887.77 million) in the winter window while earning only 100 million euros. The numbers differ from FIFA’s report which said English clubs spent $898.6 million last month.
“A combination of the start of the new uplifted English TV deal, new club investors and a balanced bottom half of Premier League table, appear to have fuelled record English club January window activity,” UEFA’s report said.
ADVERTISEMENT
But Ceferin said UEFA must remain vigilant and “strictly implement” rules related to financial sustainability at both the European and domestic levels.
“UEFA took the first step last summer by introducing the first squad cost ratio rule in the new Financial Sustainability Regulations, restricting spending on wages, transfers, and agent fees,” Ceferin added.

“Clubs will be assessed against limit on these costs, moving from 90% in 2023 to 70% in 2025, providing a timely and direct measure between squad costs and income to encourage more performance-related costs, while limiting the market inflation of wages and transfer costs of players.

Liverpool team ‘incredibly fresh’ after Klopp gives days off,"""On Sunday after we spoke about everything I thought 100 per cent it makes sense if we don't see each other for two days, and it was helpful,"" Klopp said on Friday.","Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp could have forced his players to run extra wind sprints or sit through more film sessions in the wake of another loss.
Instead, he gave them a couple of days off.
“On Sunday after we spoke about everything I thought 100 per cent it makes sense if we don’t see each other for two days, and it was helpful,” Klopp said on Friday.
The 3-0 loss at Wolverhampton last Saturday left Liverpool in 10th place and still in search of its first Premier League win in 2023. Liverpool has one draw and three losses in its last four league games.
“In Germany this question would have come much earlier — how can you give them two days off when you are in the situation you are in,” the German manager said.
The schedule also was favourable for time off — Liverpool doesn’t play Everton until Monday night.
“I left on Sunday in an average mood, and came back with a good mood,” Klopp said.

India vs Australia: I’ll look back at this feat for rest of my life and be proud of: Murphy,"Murphy has so far picked up 5 for 82 in 36 overs in India's first innings, with the wickets of KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli in his kitty.","Todd Murphy has had a “special” couple of days and the bespectacled Australian Test debutant, who resembled more like a professor of history rather than practitioner of finger spin, couldn’t be happier for his five-wicket haul against India in the ongoing opening Test here.
Murphy has so far picked up 5 for 82 in 36 overs in India’s first innings, with the wickets of KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli in his kitty.
“It’s been a pretty special couple of days and to top it off with a five-wicket haul on debut is more than I ever hope for and it is going to be something that I’ll look back on for the rest of my life and be proud of,” Murphy said at the end of the second day’s play.
Murphy was all praise for the Indian batters and their ability to use their hands against spinners.
“I haven’t bowled to a lot of people from around the world but I think the Indian guys they use their hands really well. They get their hands out in front of their pads and they have got a lot of scoring options too.
“So always a really difficult challenge there. And it was quite tough,” he said.
Murphy started out as a medium pacer but later found off-breaks to be his calling card.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I think in all honesty my medium pace wasn’t really any good anyway, so it sort of just came a time where I was tinkering in the nets with off-spin bowling and yeah, got some really good feedback that what was coming out of my hand was alright.
“So, just went from there and kept working at it and it’s been the best thing I’ve ever done. So thankful I have,” he said.
It has been one hell of a journey for Murphy, who wasn’t even playing first-class cricket a year back and now has five-for in Tests to boast of.
“I think this time last year I was still not in the state side so it sort of has been quite quick progress,” he admitted.
ADVERTISEMENT
Murphy said his career changed when he toured Sri Lanka with the Australia A side last year.
“But one of the biggest things for me was getting to go to Sri Lanka and being on that A tour and having a little bit of success over that probably gave me the confidence I needed going back to Australia that I could mix it with first class cricketers.” He got guidance from some of the players, who have already played international cricket and that helped him understand the requirements of the top level.

Lionel Messi to be available for Champions League game with Bayern,Messi strained his hamstring in the 2-1 loss to Marseille on Wednesday in the French Cup.,"Lionel Messi will be available for the Champions League game against Bayern Munich on Tuesday despite being left out of the squad for this weekend’s French league match at Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain coach Christophe Galtier said Friday.
Messi strained his hamstring in the 2-1 loss to Marseille on Wednesday in the French Cup.
“Leo won’t be available for the Monaco game tomorrow,” Galtier said. “He will resume training on Monday, the day before the game against Bayern Munich. So you can leave the term ‘doubtful’ aside.”

PSG was undefeated in all competitions from August to December but the team lost to Lens and Rennes in the league last month before getting knocked out by Marseille in the French Cup.
“We know the importance of Leo in our game,” Galtier said. “Because of his absence, we will maybe have to play differently to have a more solid and more compact team.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/lionel-messi-to-be-available-for-champions-league-game-with-bayern-8437404/,sports
"India vs Australia: Rohit was made to work hard, surface wasn’t easy to bat on: Rathour","Rohit's hundred and half-centuries from Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel has given India a first innings lead of 144, going into the third day.","Australia made Rohit Sharma “work hard” for his 120-run knock and it was a special effort since it came on a track that wasn’t easy to bat on, India batting coach Vikram Rathour said after the hosts strengthened their position in the series-opener.
Rohit’s hundred and half-centuries from Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel has given India a first innings lead of 144, going into the third day.
“It was a special innings by Rohit and it is a great feeling (to see him score runs). He showed good temperament and it was very important innings as the surface wasn’t easy to bat on,” Rathour said at the end of the second day’s play.
Since he started opening in Test matches, Rohit has played some great knocks but the three hundreds that stand out include his epic 161 on a Chepauk snake pit, a ton at the Oval and Friday’s knock on a low, slow turner against Australia.
“That is the quality of his batting,” Rathour said.
“He has got runs on seaming tracks in England. But if we talk about this particular innings, he was made to work hard for his runs. Normally, with Rohit when he scores his first few runs, he then pushes the score. But here he had to work hard,” the former Test opener said.
India scored 95 runs in the final session, courtesy a 81-run stand between Axar (52 batting) and Jadeja (66 batting) but Rathour didn’t want to sound complacent about the fact that the match is as good as in India’s pocket.
“I don’t think so. You can’t say till the last ball is bowled,” he said cautiously.

When asked if Axar’s batting came into consideration when he was picked ahead of Kuldeep, Rathour denied emphatically. “He (Axar) has been exceptional with the ball so that was not even a consideration. Yes, (his) batting is a bonus,” he added.

Rahul has two hundreds in last 10 Tests
Rathour went on the defensive the moment the question about KL Rahul’s form cropped up.

So we are not yet there.” For the record, the century in England came in August, 2021 and the one in South Africa in January, 2022.

‘Pitch will play well till we bat but when we get the chance to bowl…’: Axar Patel makes bold prediction for Day 3,Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja slammed fifties to defy the Australian bowling attack on Day 2.,"Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel added 81 runs for the eighth wicket to help India take the advantage at the end of Day 2 in Nagpur. Jadeja was unbeaten on 66 runs, while Patel was batting on 52 not out.
Jadeja and Patel, however, defied the Australian bowling for the remainder of the final session with a stand that lasted 185 balls in total. Jadeja reached his half-century off 114 balls, while Patel got to 50 off 94 balls.
After close of play, Axar Patel reflected on his performance and said that he was optimistic of performing with the bat.
“I have been doing well with the bat for the last one year. That confidence is coming in handy. My technique – I always knew it was good. I work on it when I get a break. Work with the coaching staff. They tell me that I have the ability, so I try to contribute,” he told Star Sports.
“When you go in to bat you find some difficulty (on that pitch), but it gets easier after spending some time. The talk with Jadeja was to not lose focus,” he added.
Axar also had a forewarning for the Kangaroos when asked about the pitch and said, “Till the time we bat tomorrow the pitch will play well, and when we get the chance to bowl – we’ll find help (laughs).”
India, who first played for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia in 1996-97, have won the last three series in 2017, 2018-19 and 2020-21.

Just as he reached the boundary ropes, he turned back wistfully and shook his head in despair. To his name on the scoreboard read 120 runs, he had single-handedly put his team a dominant position, he had crafted perhaps his most valuable Test hundred, yet Sharma was discontent, unable to neither forget nor forgive himself for the momentary lapse in focus, for the fleeting forgetfulness to bring the bat down in time to blunt the ball.
Smiles, claps & appreciation all around! 😊 👏

For much of the day, until Pat Cummins took the new ball, he was impenetrable. Nothing would defeat him, not the devils of the pitch, not the discipline of Australia’s spinners, not his own intemperance. This was the most atypical Sharma hundred in Tests at home (his slowest after Oval too), yet this could be the most precious of his knocks in this format, one wherein he transformed into a different, almost unrecognisable batsman. But a hundred that ensured his team walked away with a sizable advantage.
The batsman who reeled off 56 off 69 balls on Day One was different to the one who gritted 64 runs off 143 balls on Day Two.
Those seem like two different types of innings altogether. Therein lies his mastery too. To bat in an uncharacteristic manner, to bat for the demands of the team and in lieu with the conditions. A conquest of conditions, bowlers and his own impulses. It was a knock constructed with different aesthetics — there still was grace and grandeur — but it was blended with sweat and soil.
Through this knock shone his remarkable gift to play differently on different days and conditions, a reflection as much as of his versatility as his flexibility. Not that he is unskilled at batting time, he has previously shed his flashiness in England, but seldom has he batted as circumspectly in home conditions as he did in this innings.

On Thursday evening, he whirred in fifth gear, taking a toll on tired Australian minds and bodies. Friday was more of consolidation and accumulation. A quick foundation laid, it was the time to gradually build the floors and construct an unclimbable sky-riser for Australia, who were fresher and steelier. He knew he was the sturdiest pillar holding the building steady, more so after India lost the wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav in the space of 33 runs. At 168/5 on a turner, India were clutching at straws. But Sharma breathed assurance, though the crowd were fidgeting at his abstinence.
ADVERTISEMENT
They had flocked — the Wardha Road that leads to the VCA stadium was busier than usual — to watch the boundary-blasting Sharma avatar, but instead he enthralled them with a treatise on playing spin bowling on a low, turning surface against an ultra-tight group of bowlers.
Playing a double-bluff
The Australians perhaps thought they could induce indiscretion by suffocating him. Cut out the boundaries, suffocate him and make him play a stroke in frustration. But here he played the double-bluff. He not only kept away from all the traps and lures, but kept defending stoutly, and in turn tiring and frustrating them to submission. There were long passages where he did not stroke a boundary, long phases where he did not score a run, especially in the first session. For 43 balls, either side of lunch, he did not strike a single boundary. He didn’t even bother. He would block, blunt and if the field permitted stole singles. This was pressure-free, risk-less batting at its best, one which the Australians should study to get insights into batting on the subcontinent.
The way he defied the around the stumps line of spinners Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy could be a lesson to his batting colleagues too. Serene and steady, he neutered them by playing from inside the line.
From around the stumps, the most dangerous ball is the one that slides in with the angle, or even turns a fraction away, where a right-handed batsman would be tempted to lunge at the ball with an open bat-face. He was not afraid of the one that slips back, because the turn was slow and he had ample time to defend off the back-foot. Murphy, quicker than Lyon then started to bowl middle and leg, but Sharma would just stretch and defend with ease. Lyon would intermittently float the ball, dangling the bait to drive uppishly into short mid-on. But Sharma would not relent, though in his early eighties, he slapped a delicious flick off Murphy, just to remind the young bowler that he has the ammo to attack, but that he was deliberately not unleashing them.

He did not step down the surface too often, though he loves to. But he displayed that twinkling feet are not just about gliding down the surface, moving your feet quickly. His switch from back-foot to front-foot and vice versa, his quick and smooth transfer of weight, could be compiled into a manual of batting in the subcontinent.
As always, he struck some delightful strokes, some of which would have been unimaginable for most. Like a pull shot off Cummins. On a low-bounce surface, he dragged the ball from outside the off-stump, rolled his wrists over it and smeared him over backward square-leg. In touch, he could play impossible shots on impossible tracks. But how he kept aside such temptations was the beauty of his latest hundred, one that he would perhaps regard as his finest, in terms of how it contributed to his team’s cause as well as how he made his shirt dirty when achieving it.

The light ‘Roller effect’: Sunil Gavaskar on why Nagpur pitch behaves differently in second session,"IND vs AUS: Also, read about the instance when Virat Kohli used the heavy roller and it backfired. Also, the occasion when Sachin Tendulkar opted not to use any roller","India vs Australia: Right at the end of the first session on second day at Nagpur Test, even as Mark Waugh and Ravi Shastri were wondering why the pitch appeared to be eased out in the morning, with Shastri saying it could be because the moisture is out of the pitch by now, Sunil Gavaskar made a pithy comment about the roller.
“The roller makes a big difference. The roller Indians used levelled up the pitch in the first hour. That’s why we saw couple of wickets in the second hour, bit more turn and variable bounce etc”.
It’s learnt that light roller was used by the Indians on the morning before the start of play. It’s the prerogative of the batting captain to choose the roller he wants: heavy or light at start of the play, according to the ICC’s playing conditions.
The effect of the roller wears away after a while and the pitch starts to bake under the sun and cracks widen again in the second session. Hence more variable bounce and bit more misbehaviour from the pitch in the second session.

Why not a heavy roller, though? A curator explains.
“Light roller will just disturb the top layer, especially on turners. And as the day progresses, the second it will break up a lot under the sun. But if you use a hard roller, it will break up the entire thing – bottom layer as well and there is chance it will crumble.
Especially the red soil, as it is in Nagpur, it can tend to crumble under heavy roller. If the soft roller used, it will take just the top off and bottom stays intact,” he told this newspaper.
Shastri’s point about moisture holds good for the morning sessions. When moisture escapes the surface, not just fast bowlers, it helps spinners grip and turn as Shastri regularly explains on commentary.
ADVERTISEMENT
It’s another thing that heavy roller can do as a side-effect. It can compress the soil hard and release the moisture.
When Kohli possibly used the wrong roller
Occasionally, the heavy roller can back fire too as it’s presumed to have done to the Indians at the Newlands pitch in a Test match in 2018. After being bundled out for a modest total of 209 runs in the first innings, India restricted South Africa to just 130 runs in the second innings, setting a target of 208 runs for themselves. With a batting order full of star names, chasing this down wasn’t a tough task, or at least it seemed like. Indian captain Virat Kohli wanted a hard-pressed pitch to chase this total down. So, in came ‘Big Blue’, Newland’s heavy roller.
There is no scientific proof for this but the anecdotal evidence suggested the heavy roller ended up spicing the pitch.
It is believed that more pressure on the surface leads to moisture being squeezed out. Often, a heavy roller can also end up making a surface faster, helping the seamers.
India were bowled out for 135. “I thought Kohli was quite clever on Day 1. He used the small roller at the change of innings. It didn’t liven the pitch up or anything. Sometimes, the heavy roller can quicken the pitch up but take the seam movement out. Look, it’s not based on research. Most of it is anecdotal,” the curator Evan Flint told The Indian Express.

“The heavy roller draws moisture up from underneath, but I’m not so sure of that … It’s possible.”

When Tendulkar didn’t use a roller
Like Sachin Tendulkar had during his last Ranji game against Haryana at Lahli, a pacer’s paradise, in 2013. Back in 2013, Tendulkar urged the Mumbai captain Zaheer Khan to take the “none of the above” option when the visitors were given the “light” or “strong” option at the start of the innings that would be his last for Mumbai.
Nestled in the middle of fields, the water table of the area at Lahli is quite high. Locals have seen games where the pitch gets greener and faster with each passing day.In the first innings, Tendulkar had fallen cheaply to pacer Mohit Sharma, beaten by a rising ball. The ball had pitched on a length, landed on the seam and climbed. Tendulkar’s push was beaten; the ball hit his right elbow and ricocheted onto the stumps.

Years later, Haryana wicketkeeper Nitin Saini spoke about the game and the genius of Tendulkar.

“In the second innings, Sachin paaji refused to take the heavy roller and we were all surprised because conventional wisdom says it would make the pitch more conducive to bat on. He made 79 not out. Later, he told us that since the water table is so high here, having the pitch rolled would have got the moisture out and made batting tough against the seamers. And we were like ‘we had played on this pitch all our lives and never thought of it’.”
According to the playing conditions of the ICC, it’s the fielding team’s prerogative.
“During the match the pitch may be rolled at the request of the captain of the batting side, for a period of not more than 7 minutes, before the start of each innings, other than the first innings of the match, and before the start of each subsequent day’s play.” Further, Law 10.

What is Formula E? All you need to know ahead of inaugural race in India,"Formula E is an electric equivalent of the widely followed Formula 1 which was staged in India from 2011 to 2013. However, other than the ‘Formula' prefix, there is no similarity between the two FIA world championship status events.","Big-ticket motorsport action returns to India after a decade with Hyderabad becoming the 30th location to host a Formula E race.
Here is all you need to know about the all-electric racing series ahead of its first race in India on Saturday.
How different is it to Formula 1?
Formula E is an electric equivalent of the widely followed Formula 1 which was staged in India from 2011 to 2013. However, other than the ‘Formula’ prefix, there is no similarity between the two FIA world championship status events.
The hybrid turbo-charged engines in Formula 1 are the epitome of performance while the battery-powered Formula E machines promote sustainability and a greener world. Formula E is racing with a purpose but its cars have rapidly evolved over the last eight seasons and Gen3 technology has been introduced this season. As the series claims, Gen3 is the fastest, lightest, most powerful and efficient car in its history.
For the first time ever, we're heading to India!
IT'S RACE WEEK 🤩

It has a top speed of 320 kmph, a 100kmph faster than the first generation cars used from 2014-2017. The Gen2 cars were run from 2018-2022 and they could touch speeds over 280kmph. Since most of the Formula E races are held on the twisty street circuits around the world with not so long straights, top speeds are not reached often.
40 percent of energy produced while braking
In the first season, the batteries could only produce 200kw of power requiring the drivers to swap cars midway into the race. The introduction of the more powerful Gen2 cars meant the cars could last the full race distance.
The power output has been increased to 350kw in the Gen3 cars and with regeneration, it could go up to 600kw.
More than 40 percent of the energy will come from regenerative braking, an increase of 25 percent over Gen2 machines. The series has a new tyre supplier in Hankook but drivers are not fully satisfied with its performance. The latest cars are also 60kg lighter than the previous generation and weigh at 840kg.
Homecoming for Mahindra Racing
Mahindra Racing, which has been with Formula E since its inception, will finally get to experience the thrill of a home race after eight seasons.
This is it 😍🇮🇳 After years of competing across the globe, with technology and sustainability at the forefront of every moment, Mahindra Racing is preparing to race in front of a home crowd at India’s first-ever Formula E race, the Greenko Hyderabad E-Prix. #CheerForTeamMahindra pic.twitter.com/A9Ey18p0X7

The other manufacturers in the championship include Nissan, Porsche, Tata owned Jaguar. McLaren and Maserati are the new entrants. After winning the title last season, Mercedes withdrew from the championship. Audi and BMW too are no longer part of the championship.

After a podium in the opening race of the season in Mexico, Mahindra will be hoping for an encore.
The racing format
To ensure minimum disruption in public life, most of the action is packed in one day with FP2, qualifying and race scheduled on Saturday.
Formula E introduced a new qualifying format last season calling it “Duels” with drivers taking on each other in quarterfinals, semifinals and finals after qualifying from group stage.
The winning driver of the final duel takes Pole Position, while the runner-up lines up second. The semi-finalists will line up third and fourth, the quarter-finalists between fifth and eighth – according to their laptimes.
The Hyderabad track

Hyderabad will be round four of the championship. Saudia Arabia hosted two races in January after the season opener in Mexico.
Formula E sees India as a huge market and hopes to have a long future in the country.
“It took us too long to get to India. We will be here until they want us,” Formula E co-founder Alberto Longo had said after marking the 100-day countdown to the race.

"Context of the game, standard and rarity must matter: Shaun Pollock","With matches taking place round the year, big names such as Kane Williamson, Graeme Smith and Steve Waugh had in the past spoken about the need to strike a balance in scheduling and provide context to the games.","South African fast-bowling great Shaun Pollock wants more “context and contest” in international cricket so that the game stays as “main CD” instead of becoming “background music” amidst an incredible surge in the number of matches.
With matches taking place round the year, big names such as Kane Williamson, Graeme Smith and Steve Waugh had in the past spoken about the need to strike a balance in scheduling and provide context to the games.
“I just think that sometimes the context of the game and also the standard and the rarity matter,” Pollock, also a former Proteas captain, said during an interaction here.
“For example, in golfing terms the Masters is a wonderful tournament because it happens once a year, it’s four days or whatever it may be. Wimbledon too. Here, you keep playing, putting that output of more and more cricket.
“It becomes background music, you know, rather than listening to it as a main CD. So I would hate it to become that way.” Pollock, who had held his own in an era dominated by some of the game’s all-time great fast bowlers, doesn’t mind the entertainment T20 cricket provides, but also wants good contest between the bat and ball.
“I personally think that T20 cricket is entertainment with a bit of a cricket flavour rather than the true form of testing your ability.
“Don’t get me wrong, people love it. I think some of the skills on display, some of the athleticism, some of the performances, the batting and the bowling, you know, some of it can be admired, but whether it’s a contest as much as it should be all the time, I’m not so sure about that.” The interaction was organized by Sports18 and Jio Cinema.
Is too much cricket affecting the longevity of players, particularly fast bowlers? “I think there have been stats given about the amount of overs they have bowled. Indian bowlers, for example, are only allowed to play the IPL, our guys can go wherever they want. So that’s probably more cricket that they have to play.” When asked what has changed in the Indian fast-bowling unit over the years, Pollock said the pool is much bigger now.

“You have got more now, that’s all. You still have had some great ones. I think Javagal (Srinath) never gets the credit that he deserved. He would come here (South Africa) with (Venkatesh) Prasad and then we had Dodda Ganesh, David Johnson, that was the backup then.
“Now you’ve got four, and that’s just a big difference. You always had some good ones over the years. I mean, Kapil Dev, Manoj Prabhakar, but didn’t really have that depth.
“Now you’ve got an attack where if someone gets injured you’ve got another. And I think they’ve all learned the skills.
“The IPL is a no brainer for you guys. You get the best teams, you get exposure for six weeks or seven weeks. If you’re unsure about whether a guy can or can’t do it at the international level, you get to see what he does against international players.
ADVERTISEMENT
“In the old days you would maybe have a tour match where you could judge him on his performance. Now you’ve got it day in and day out. I mean the training that they do now, the skills that some of the other coaches, international coaches, national trainers, local coaches, local trainers, that’s all improved now.
“Strength wise they’re there. They’ve all got the skills. Bumrah is a different bowler to Shami, Siraj is very different, they all complement each other.” As the discussion turned to the swashbuckling Suryakumar Yadav, he was asked what he would have done to counter the world’s number one T20 batter.
“SKY was with us at Mumbai Indians back in the day. He got into trouble because he was not that SKY then. I think now he has become very good at scoring in awkward areas.
“To be honest, I would make him try and hit me back over my head. I don’t think that’s his strength. He goes over extra cover, midwicket, scoop and third man.
ADVERTISEMENT
“For the straight back shots, I would set fields accordingly, you have to try and target, and then hit length deliveries and see if he can do it. But I think the key to him is he’s learned his game plan. And he understands it brilliantly well.
“Whether there’s a predictive element to it, where he tries to pop balls into different areas, and not really worrying about what length you know, you don’t really know his own mindset. But he’s done brilliantly.
“I mean, his strike rate and the way he’s dictated terms when he’s been at the crease, he’s been fantastic. I think it’s also the age, you know, he’s 31-32. Whatever it is, he’s developed, he’s been through the middle of working through his game and understanding it now. And I think he’s bearing fruit.
With the success of the inaugural SA20 league, he was asked if Cricket South Africa (CSA) has plans to help its former cricketers, like the BCCI has done for its past players.

“It would be nice but I understand there is a touchy nature to it and how far back do you go. Past, present I know you (BCCI) guys have got a scheme in place.

"IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 2: Rohit Sharma slams ton, Jadeja-Axar extend India’s lead to 144 runs","India vs Australia Day 2: India have a grip over this Test, thanks to the Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.","India vs Australia, 1st Test Day 2: Just as on Day 1, Ravindra Jadeja was the hero for the Indian team on Day 2 of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, after scoring 66 runs with the bat. He consolidated on Rohit Sharma’s 120-run effort to hand India a decisive advantage on Day 2 of the first Test at stumps. The hosts were leading by 144 runs at the end of day’s play. Axar Patel also joined in with a half century of his own, ending the day with a knock of 52 runs.
For Australia, 22-year-old spinner Todd Murphy was the star with the ball, claiming a five-wicket haul to end the day with figures of 82/5 in 36 overs.
Only time will tell how critical to the larger scheme of things that dropped catch of Jadeja in the final over of the day will prove to be. In fact, that opportunity came to Australia’s Steve Smith in the penultimate ball of the second day.
Jadeja, as his all-round effort testifies, has come out hungry to do well and make an impact on this series, particularly after spending a large amount of time last year out of the game, rehabilitating from a knee injury.
India vs Australia, 1st Test Day 2 Tea Update
Earlier, Rohit and Jadeja frustrated the Australians in the second session of Day 2 of, with the duo taking India past 200 at tea break. As Sharma scored his first century as a captain in Tests, Jadeja, who has a history of digging in his heels particularly when the Australians are starting to take control of the game, was at his opportunistic best, punishing the Australian bowlers whenever he saw a slip-up.
You can also follow our full highlights of the second day’s action from the first Test on our liveblog. 
Before start of play, Marnus Labuschagne had spoken of how one wicket can turn the complexion of the game by giving the example of how Australia slid from 84 for 2 to being all out for 177. While India did lose the wickets of Virat Kohli (12) and Suryakumar Yadav (eight) close to each other, Jadeja held down the door.

Yadav, whose inclusion in the side for the first Test evoked quite a lot of debate, started his debut Test innings with flair: sweeping  the second ball he faced from Todd Murphy for a boundary to get off the mark! That was, however, the only boundary he scored, falling for just eight runs off 20 deliveries. Murphy has been the pick of the Australian innings so far, claiming four wickets for 59 runs. Nathan Lyon has just the one wicket so far, but he cleaned up Yadav with an absolute peach of a delivery.
India vs Australia, 1st Test Day 2 lunch update
Leading from the front, Rohit Sharma helped India assert their dominance by lunch break of Day 2. The Indian skipper had scored 85 runs at the end of the first session of Friday at Nagpur. Giving him company at the other end was Virat Kohli, who was batting at 12. India were 151/3. Australia took two wickets in that session, India scored 74 runs to come within 26 runs of overhauling Australia’s first session total.
When the day started, Ravichandran Ashwin got into the act as well, showing why he is a man with five centuries and 13 half centuries. But he lost his wicket for 23 runs with youngster Todd Murphy claiming his wicket too after taking KL Rahul’s scalp on Day 1. The, before India’s best player of spin, Cheteshwar Pujara could really get settled at the crease, he induced a top edge while the batter tried to sweep. Pujara was gone for seven runs, with his stint in the middle lasting just 14 balls.
Murphy was the pick of the bowlers in the first session as well.

At the other end, Sharma’s wicket was barely threatened during the first session, except when there was a mix-up with Kohli in the 48th over with him batting on 83. But the throw at the non-striker’s end was not on target so Sharma survived a close call.
Australia’s woes were compounded by the fact that Matt Renshaw had to been sent for scans after injuring his knee during the warm-up for Day 2.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-1st-test-day-2-lunch-update-rohit-sharma-on-cusp-of-century-todd-murphy-makes-mark-8435998/,sports

"Lionel Scaloni, Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola on FIFA coach award shortlist","A worldwide selection panel of national team coaches and captains, plus selected media and fans voting online chose Scaloni of Argentina, Real Madrid's Ancelotti and Manchester City's Guardiola as finalists for FIFA's Best Men's Coach award for 2022.","Lionel Scaloni, Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola were shortlisted for a “best coach” award, while Walid Regragui didn’t get enough votes despite leading Morocco on a stunning run to the World Cup semifinals.
A worldwide selection panel of national team coaches and captains, plus selected media and fans voting online chose Scaloni of Argentina, Real Madrid’s Ancelotti and Manchester City’s Guardiola as finalists for FIFA’s Best Men’s Coach award for 2022.
Argentina won the World Cup, Madrid won the UEFA Champions League and City captured the English Premier League title.
Regragui was appointed in August less than three months before the World Cup started and led his team unbeaten through a group that included Belgium and Croatia. Morocco then eliminated Spain and Portugal before an injury-stricken team lost to defending champion France. During the run, Regragui had voiced concerns about a lack of respect for Arab coaches.
No coach from Africa or of an African team has ever been voted into a top-three shortlist since the first FIFA coaching award was made in 2010.
Only European and South American coaches have ever finished in the top-three places despite two-thirds of the voting panel members coming from outside the continents.
Scaloni is a likely favorite to get the award on Feb. 27 in Paris after World Cup-winning coaches Didier Deschamps and Joachim Löw also won the FIFA votes for 2018 and 2014, respectively.
ADVERTISEMENT
After winning the 2010 World Cup, Spain’s then-coach Vicente del Bosque was just beaten in the FIFA-organized vote by José Mourinho, whose Inter Milan team had won the Champions League and Serie A.
Guardiola won the FIFA coaching award for 2011 when he was with Barcelona. Ancelotti has never won; he was runner-up in 2014 to Löw for winning a Champions League in his first spell with Madrid.
On the women’s coaching award shortlist Thursday, two-time winner Sarina Wiegman — who won the 2017 and 2020 votes for coaching her native Netherlands — seeks a third FIFA win for leading England to the European Championship title last year.
Another European champion, Sonia Bompastor, who guided Lyon to a sixth Women’s Champions League title in seven years, is on the list that is completed by Pia Sundhage. She led Brazil to win the 2022 Copa América Femenina.

Manchester United Women’s Supporters’ Club founder Natalie Burrell echoed their sentiments. “I don’t think he should play again for Manchester United,’ Burrell said to the Athletic. ‘It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world. They need to make a statement and letting him back would be the worst thing they could do,” she said.
“It would set our club back in terms of what we’re trying to do with our women’s team and campaigns like Her Game Too, which are trying to encourage women to play and watch football.”
“I definitely don’t want him back and I’m confident they won’t, whether that’s through selling him in the summer I don’t know.
“People just think they’re going to write it off (his contract runs until 2025 and has the option of another year) and maybe they will — that would be a real statement – but I’d be surprised. If they just sold him it’d be a good statement too.

That was followed by Al Nassr losing the Saudi Super Cup semifinal against Al-Ittihad, a defeat after which the star forward came under scrutiny.
After the match, Al Nassr manager Rudi Garcia put some blame on that gilt edged chance by Ronaldo as one of the reasons for losing the match. “One of the things that changed the course of the match was Cristiano Ronaldo’s missed opportunity in the first half,” he said.

Riyadh’s King Fahd International Stadium to host Santosh Trophy semifinals and final,All India Football Federation (AIFF) secretary general Shaji Prabhakaran told a press conference here that the dates have been fixed after consultation with their Saudi Arabian counterparts.,"The semifinals and final of the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy will be held between March 1 and 4 at the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the national federation announced on Thursday.
All India Football Federation (AIFF) secretary general Shaji Prabhakaran told a press conference here that the dates have been fixed after consultation with their Saudi Arabian counterparts.
“This is a great moment for Indian football, as the four states that make it to the semifinals will get to fight for the Santosh Trophy title in Saudi Arabia,” Prabhakaran said.
He pointed out that the incentive to play in Saudi Arabia would make the Santosh Trophy final round, beginning here on Friday, an even more interesting and competitive event.
“The battle for the last four is likely to be an intense one, and we all hope that the fight will go down to the wire to book a spot on the international stage, which will be the first time since 1941, when the Santosh Trophy was launched as a six-venue tournament with the final being played in Kolkata,” said Prabhakaran.
“The Santosh Trophy is central to our plans in development of football across the country, as we look to improve the conditions for all our State FAs to make bigger contributions in taking Indian football forward.
“Helping out Member Associations is central to our plans for long term growth, as we have charted out last month in Vision 2047, and these are just baby steps towards a much larger goal.” Prabhakaran also spoke at length about the development of football across the country, something that has been presented by the national federation in the Vision 2047 document earlier this year.

"India vs Australia: After Ravindra Jadeja, Rohit Sharma ensures India seizes control of Nagpur Test on Day 1","IND vs AUS: On a slow turner, spinners shut Australia to 177 as skipper leads hosts strong reply","Just after Rohit Sharma clumped Nathan Lyon over mid-wicket, the off-spinner stared suspiciously at the surface. The pitch might have stared back inexpressively at him. Lyon had beaten him three balls ago, some balls before that were scudding low as well, but the 22-yard patch of intrigue and interest seemed to be more benign when Sharma rampaged to an unbeaten 56 off 69 balls, taking India to 77/1 at stumps, exactly a century of runs behind Australia’s total.
Perhaps, this was a case of batsman’s skills providing the pitch a harmless makeover. Perhaps, Australia’s batsmen made it look harder than it actually was. Perhaps, Sharma’s cavalier approach was the way to bat on this low-bounce, slow-turning deck. Maybe, Australia were a fraction overcautious in phases in the first session. Maybe, India’s spinners simply bowled better, tighter and sharper, though without any doubt this was a challenging surface to bat.

‘I don’t want to put too many expectations on myself’: Australia’s fiery pacer Lance Morris,Lance Morris recently won the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year and can potentially replace Mitchell Starc for the first Test.,"Lance Morris, who is yet to make his debut for Australia, is part of the 18-man squad that will play 4 Tests in India from February 9.
The 24-year-old tearaway fast bowler might get the nod to play the first Test in Nagpur, especially after senior placeman Starc said on Monday that he is unlikely to be ready for the first Test after suffering a finger injury.
However, the highly-rated cricketer is not putting too much pressure on himself and is looking to use his trip to the subcontinent as a “learning opportunity”.
“I don’t want to put too many expectations on myself,” Morris told SEN Mornings.
“I just want to use this as a learning experience, I’ve never toured with cricket before so this will be my first overseas experience.
“It’s going to be a huge learning opportunity for me.”
“The feedback (of bowling pace in India) hasn’t been too great, to be honest,” Morris said.

“There’s not a whole lot to look forward to, I’m not going to see the ball zipping through to the keeper and him taking it (in the gloves) fingers up.
“It sounds like it’s going to be a bit of a challenge, but it’ll be exciting nonetheless.
“We’ve got some great guys in the squad and a really experienced group now.
“It’s been good to have some training sessions learning off them.”

"Spin talk won’t blind Australia to reverse swing threats, says keeper Alex Carey",Australia batters practised on a scuffed-up pitch in Sydney before flying to India and have since gathered a bevy of local spinners for their net sessions in Bengaluru having decided against playing any warm-up matches.,"While Australia are prepared for a trial by spin in India they fully recognise the threat reverse swing may pose in the four-test series against Rohit Sharma’s men, touring wicketkeeper Alex Carey said on Friday.
Spin talk has dominated the build-up to the series between the world’s top two tests teams, who meet in the opener in Nagpur on Thursday.
Australia batters practised on a scuffed-up pitch in Sydney before flying to India and have since gathered a bevy of local spinners for their net sessions in Bengaluru having decided against playing any warm-up matches. Carey is set to play his first test in India and the 31-year-old said Australia were not oblivious to other threats lurking in these spin-friendly conditions.
“Going to Pakistan, it was a lot of spin talk, and I found the reversing ball difficult,” Carey told reporters referring to their sub-continent tour last year.
“When I played a four-day game here in 2018 a lot of talk was about spin and you probably forget a little bit about how damaging both teams’ fast bowlers are with a reversing ball, and on wicket that might be a little bit up and down.”
Carey said Australia’s batting line-up had enough experience to cope with the challenges they will face in the series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
“We are having the preparation in the game to ebb and flow between spin and fast bowling, dry periods and periods where we score quickly,” he added.

“I think what’s great about this team is the experience we have. There are players who have been here a number of times and players that are new, to be able to talk to other guys, what they’re doing, trust their game.

"Nick Kyrgios pleads guilty to assault, has no conviction recorded",The 2022 Wimbledon runner-up pleaded guilty in the Australian Capital Territory Magistrates Court to assaulting Chiara Passari during an argument in his hometown of Canberra in January 2021.,"Kyrgios had suffered severe depression, suicidal ideation and insomnia in the past, a psychologist told a court on Friday when the Australian tennis star pleaded guilty to pushing a former girlfriend to the ground two years ago.
The 2022 Wimbledon runner-up pleaded guilty in the Australian Capital Territory Magistrates Court to assaulting Chiara Passari during an argument in his hometown of Canberra in January 2021.
Magistrate Jane Campbell didn’t record a conviction against Kyrgios for reasons including that the offense was at the low end of seriousness for a common assault, and was not premeditated.
Campbell described it as an act of “stupidity” and “frustration.” Kyrgios, who was using crutches following recent surgery on his left knee, didn’t speak to reporters as he left court but issued a statement through a management company.
“I respect today’s ruling and am grateful to the court for dismissing the charges without conviction,” Kyrgios said.

“I was not in a good place when this took place and I reacted to a difficult situation in a way I deeply regret. I know it wasn’t OK and I’m sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused.
“Mental health is tough. Life can seem overwhelming. But I’ve found that getting help and working on myself has helped me to feel better and to be better.” Kyrgios’ psychologist, Sam Borenstein, said in a written report and testimony by phone that Kyrgios had suffered major depressive episodes in the past and had used alcohol and drugs to cope. Kyrgios’ mental health led to impulsive and reckless behavior.

His recent knee injury had resulted in mild to moderate symptoms of depression, but his mental health was improving, Borenstein said.
“He’s doing very well,” Borenstein said.
“His mental health has improved significantly.” Lawyers for Kyrgios had sought to have an assault charge stemming from events two years ago dismissed on mental health grounds but the application was unsuccessful.
Kyrgios had been attempting to leave Passari during an argument at 10 p.m. on Jan. 10, 2021, outside her apartment in the inner-Canberra suburb of Kingston. He called an Uber but Passari stood in the way of him closing the front passenger side door. The driver wouldn’t leave with the door open.

Kyrgios eventually pushed Passari’s shoulders backward with open palms, causing her to fall to the pavement and graze her knee, according to agreed facts read to the court.

Passari signed a police statement alleging the assault 11 months later, after her relationship with Kyrgios had ended.
His current partner, Costeen Hatzi, wrote in a character reference that she had no concerns of violence in her relationship. Hatzi was among Kyrgios’ supporters who sat behind him in court.
Kyrgios, wearing a dark suit and using the crutches for support, first spoke in court when the magistrate asked him if he could stand to enter a plea.
Kyrgios replied: “Yep, no worries, Your Honor,” as he rose to plead guilty.
ADVERTISEMENT
In February last year, Kyrgios opened up about his performance at the 2019 Australian Open, saying what appeared to be a positive time in his life had been “one of my darkest periods.” “I was lonely, depressed, negative, abusing alcohol, drugs, pushed away family and friends,” he wrote on Instagram.

“I felt as if I couldn’t talk or trust anyone. This was a result of not opening up and refusing to lean on my loved ones and simply just push myself little by little to be positive.” Kyrgios made further references to his mental health struggles during his runs last year to the final at Wimbledon and the quarterfinals at the US Open.
After ending Daniil Medvedev’s US Open title defense last September to reach the quarterfinals, Kyrgios expressed pride at lifting himself out of “some really tough situations, mentally” and “some really scary places” off the court.

The Indian women’s team, which had secured a maiden final finish in the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup, suffered a five-wicket loss to hosts South Africa in the Tri-series final on Thursday.
“There are lots of positives from the series, we did well as a bowling and batting unit. We have to just carry on these things in the World Cup as well,” Sharma said in the post-match press-conference.
“Whether we play England or any other team, we have to just focus on the things we did well here and continue doing that over there as well.
“Obviously South Africa have home conditions. But as a team, we have to carry forward what we have done right in the Tri-series and not think about the opposition but our own team, what we can do better.” Adjudged player-of the-series for taking nine wickets in five matches, Sharma said she got a lot of help from the wickets in South Africa.
“We have played in South African wickets, spinners get turn here. All these matches that we played in the Tri-series, we got a lot of help from the wicket,” she said.
“Harry di (Harmanpreet Kaur) also told me that I should just pick my spot and keep bowling according to the situation and I think we produced a good bowling effort and bowled according to the plan.” The 25-year-old has taken 96 wickets from 87 T20Is so far in her career.

Lionel Messi has doubts about playing 2026 World Cup at age 39,"""Because of age it'll be difficult to make 2026,"" Messi, 35, told Diario Ole, a sports newspaper in Argentina.","Lionel Messi may be in doubt as to whether he’ll be still playing for Argentina at the 2026 World Cup but he’s sure about one thing: he wants Lionel Scaloni to stay on as head coach until then, regardless.
The 35-year-old Messi led Argentina to the title in Qatar last December and wasn’t entirely sure if his fifth trip to the World Cup would be his last. The next edition will take place in Mexico, Canada and the United States when Messi is 39.
Messi told newspaper Olé in an interview published Thursday that he’d regularly said his age would make it difficult to play another World Cup..
“I love playing soccer, I love what I do and while I am feeling well and feel I am fit and continue to enjoy it, I will do it. But it seems to be too much until the next World Cup,” he told the newspaper. “I have to see where my career goes, what I will do. It depends on many things.”
In the near future, he suggested he wants to play in next year’s Copa America in the U.S. to help Argentina defend its title.
“I will stay a little longer, I have to enjoy this,” he said.
Scaloni is negotiating an extension of his contract with the Argentinian soccer federation and Messi thinks the coach should remain on the job.

“He is very important for the national team,” Messi said. “To continue with this process would be spectacular.”
Asked what it was like returning to his club París Saint Germain after Argentina beat France on penalties to win the World Cup, Messi said he didn’t have deep discussions about it with his teammate Kylian Mbappé, the French striker.

Odisha FC play out 2-2 draw with Chennaiyin FC,Chennaiyn FC's seventh game without a win meant they cannot afford to drop points in their last four games if they want to stay in playoff contention.,"Odisha FC played out a 2-2 draw with Chennaiyin FC to move back to sixth place in the Indian Super League table here on Thursday.
Odisha (22 points) now have a point ahead of Bengaluru FC, while Chennaiyin FC are five points behind them in eighth.
Chennaiyin FC began the game on the front foot, challenging Odisha FC with a high press. After a period of minor threats, they finally found space down the right from where Anirudh Thapa found Vincy Barretto’s diving header in the 19th minute.
But, Amrinder Singh made the first of his three big saves in the game, stretching to his left to tip it wide.

It was Odisha FC who broke the deadlock in what turned into a lively first half.
In the 24th minute, Chennaiyin FC’s miskicked long ball from the back was intercepted by Odisha FC’s high line, and with two touches, they found Diego Mauricio in the box via Isak Ralte’s through ball. The striker’s powerful left footer on the run found back of net.
But Thapa was on hand to find an equalizer the very next minute. Odisha FC were caught unawares, allowing Thapa to run in between the defenders as Aakash Sangwan found him with an inch-perfect cross from the left flank that was headed in from close range.
In the final few minutes of the first half, both Peter Sliskovic and Abdenasser El Khayati threatened to score, with the latter being denied on a long shot by Amrinder.

But once again, it was Odisha FC who went ahead minutes into the second half. This time, it was Chennaiyin FC’s defence that wasn’t alert to a run into the box.
Nandhakumar Sekar was allowed time on the right flank to put in a low cross as Isak slipped into the six yard box to slot the ball into the net.
Chennaiyin FC took control of the game again from there. In the 56th minute, they found another equaliser through El Khayati. Barreto’s run down the left seemed to have ended in a feeble cross, but the ball bounced back into the path of El Khayati who took a calm touch before placing his shot to beat Amrinder.
Amrinder put his body on the line in the 67th minute to deny substitute Kwame Karikari from close range, and El Khayati nearly pulled off a goal-of-the-season candidate when he curled a long-range shot with a short backlift only to find the post. That was their last substantial chance to win the game.

"Poland expects broad coalition to call for Olympics ban on Russian, Belarusian athletes","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said allowing Russia to compete at the 2024 Paris Games would be tantamount to showing that ""terror is somehow acceptable"".","Poland believes it will be possible to build a coalition of some 40 countries, including the U.S., Britain and Canada, by Feb. 10 supporting the call to block Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympics, a Polish minister said on Thursday.
The Baltic nations and Poland earlier Thursday called on international sports bodies to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in the Olympics and other events while the war in Ukraine continues.
“I’m convinced that a meeting that is planned for Feb. 10 will reach a conclusion of over 30 or maybe 40 sports ministers including those from the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia and Japan to decisively reject the idea to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to take part in the Games,” Poland’s Sport and Tourism Minister Kamil Bortniczuk told Reuters.
“Considering this I don’t think we will face tough decisions before the Olympics and, if we were to boycott the Games, the coalition we will be a part of will be broad enough to make holding the Games pointless.”
The International Olympic Committee announced last week that athletes from the two countries, banned from competing in Europe, might be allowed to earn slots for the Paris 2024 Games through Asian qualifying, although the IOC later said it was standing by sanctions imposed against Russia and Belarus.
“Any effort by the International Olympic Committee to bring back Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete, even under a neutral flag, should be rejected,” sports ministers from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland said in a statement on Thursday.
“Efforts to return Russian and Belarusian athletes to international sports competitions under the veil of neutrality legitimize political decisions and widespread propaganda of these countries,” it added.

They called on “all international sports organizations and federations” to remove Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competitions until the war ends.
Strong supporters
The three Baltic states and Poland, members of the European Union and NATO which border Russia and Belarus, have been strong supporters of Ukraine and among the first to send weapons following Moscow’s invasion almost a year ago.
Russia says it is defending its own security and denies accusations of widespread atrocities in Ukraine.
Latvia joined Kyiv on Wednesday in threatening to boycott the 2024 Olympics and qualifiers if Russian and Belarusian athletes are included while the war continues in Ukraine.
ADVERTISEMENT
Athletes from Russia and its neighbour Belarus, which aided Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, have been banned from many international competitions since.
However last week, the IOC said the Olympic Council of Asia had offered Russian and Belarusian athletes the chance to compete in Asia, drawing an outcry from Kyiv which has called for Russian sportspeople to be banned over Russia’s invasion.

‘Terror is somehow acceptable’
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said allowing Russia to compete at the 2024 Paris Games would be tantamount to showing that “terror is somehow acceptable”.
ADVERTISEMENT
Organisers of next year’s summer Olympics in Paris have, however, insisted they would abide by the IOC’s decision on Russian and Belarusian participation.
Paris 2024 told Reuters in a statement on Wednesday that their hands were tied on who could qualify for the Summer Games.
“With regard to the presence of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Paris 2024 Games, it should be recalled that the qualification system is determined by the international federations, the IOC and the IPC (International Paralympic Committee),” Paris 2024 said, stressing that the IOC had taken several measures against Russia and Belarus.
Russians have competed as neutrals with no flag or anthem in the past three Olympics as punishment for state-backed doping.

Women’s World Cup hosts urge FIFA not to sign Saudi sponsor,"Leaders of the two national soccer federations warned in a letter to FIFA, including president Gianni Infantino, that unilaterally sealing the “Visit Saudi” sponsorship could “severely tarnish the reputation” of the 32-nation tournament that starts in July.","Women’s World Cup co-hosts Australia and New Zealand urged FIFA not to sign a sponsor deal with the tourism authority of Saudi Arabia where “rights of women remain severely restricted.”
Leaders of the two national soccer federations warned in a letter to FIFA, including president Gianni Infantino, that unilaterally sealing the “Visit Saudi” sponsorship could “severely tarnish the reputation” of the 32-nation tournament that starts in July.
That is despite the tourism brand being endorsed by men’s World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi, who was announced last year as a paid pitchman.
Such a confrontation between a World Cup host and FIFA is unprecedented in recent history, and is likely to shine more attention on so-called “sportswashing” investments by Saudi Arabia.
“We write to express our serious disappointment and concern at the news of the apparent appointment of Visit Saudi as a sponsor,” Chris Nikou of Australia and New Zealand’s Joanna Wood wrote Wednesday in the letter to FIFA seen by The Associated Press.
“We cannot express strongly enough the potential repercussions and fallout that could result of this decision.
“Australia and New Zealand, both as sovereign nations and as football associations, have for decades placed the utmost importance on gender equality, and have sought to promote these ideals around the world,” the letter said, reminding FIFA their governments have invested hundreds of millions in the soccer event.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tournament organizers and government officials in both countries were said not to have been consulted, they claimed, nor offered the chance to make a counter proposal for a domestic tourism campaign.
Wood is among the few women to lead one of FIFA’s 211 member federations and also an elected member of FIFA’s ruling council which Infantino chairs.
FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia has made progress in women’s soccer in the past three years creating a national team and a domestic league, plus preparing a bid to host the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup.
ADVERTISEMENT
In Saudi society, however, women’s freedoms are limited by strict male guardianship laws.
“While we acknowledge some important and positive gender equality reforms have commenced in Saudi Arabia, it remains undeniable under any reasonable standard that the rights of women remain severely restricted,” the Women’s World Cup hosts wrote to FIFA.
Tony Gustavsson, head coach of Australia’s women’s national team, didn’t directly comment on the issue of the sponsorship Thursday while unveiling a squad for the Feb. 16-22 Cup of Nations tournament, but said “I know what these women stand for and what the team stands for.”
“I’ve had the privilege to meet the Matildas alumni and everyone knows the core values of this team,” he said. Football Australia “is seeking more information and the team knows what they stand for.” The “Visit Saudi” campaign was among more than 30 sponsors at the men’s World Cup in Qatar last year.
ADVERTISEMENT
FIFA did not formally announce that deal which became apparent through pitchside advertisements when the games started in November.
The Women’s World Cup is to be played July 20-Aug. 20. The United States is defending its title in the first edition of the marquee tournament expanded to 32 teams.
It will also be the first test of FIFA’s policy to separate broadcasting and sponsor deals for the Women’s World Cup from the men’s event. That was intended to give independence to women’s soccer and prove it had its own commercial value.

Tryon smashes Indian bowlers as South Africa win Tri-Series final by five wickets,"For South Africa, left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba (2/16 in 4 overs) was brilliant in the Powerplay as a frustrated Mandhana was bowled having failed to open her account in previous seven deliveries.","A poor batting performance cost Indian team dear as it suffered defeat in yet another summit clash, losing a low-scoring women’s Tri-series final to hosts South Africa by five wickets here on Thursday.
Chloe Tryon (57 not out off 32 balls) did exactly what all others failed as she counter-attacked with great gusto, hitting six fours and two sixes, to chase down a meagre 110-run target with two overs to spare.
What made Tryon’s innings extra special was the degree of difficulty all other batters encountered due to the slowness of the track.
Indian spinners Deepti Sharma, Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Sneh Rana tried their best to offset a baffling batting approach by Harleen Deol but the target was never a defendable one despite South Africa being reduced to 47 for 4 and subsequently 66 for 5 at start of 14th over.
On a pitch where the ball wasn’t coming on to the bat, Tryon did exactly opposite of what Deol did. The Indians paid a hefty price of the huge number of dot balls consumed by Deol.

“Body is fine. It will get better with rest. We have got some good performances. Unfortunately today we were not able to bat the way we wanted and the bowlers did well,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said later.
Tryon plonked her front-foot and exhibited power hitting of highest order, repeatedly targeting the arc between square leg and mid-wicket.
In the end, the victory came way more easily than one had thought as the stocky Proteas middle-order batter got a lucky six when Pooja Vastrakar dropped a dolly at deep square leg boundary to gift the opposition easy winning runs.

Earlier, Deol’s painstaking 46 off 56 balls on a slow track did more harm than good as India managed only 109 despite losing four wickets.
With stylish Smriti Mandhana dismissed for nought and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (21) also back in the dug-out just when she was getting set, Deol’s effort was a below par one as she played a huge number of dot balls which increased the pressure on Deepti Sharma (16 not out off 14 balls), who also couldn’t do much of the heavy-lifting.
Worse still, there was no effort from India to force the pace and Deol was happy playing the sheet anchor till she lost her wicket in the final over.
For South Africa, left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba (2/16 in 4 overs) was brilliant in the Powerplay as a frustrated Mandhana was bowled having failed to open her account in previous seven deliveries. She charged down the track and played all over a delivery that disturbed the leg stump.

Other opener Jemimah Rodrigues (11 off 18 balls) and Deol couldn’t get off the blocks against Mlaba and seasoned pacer Shabnim Ismail (0/9 in 3 overs).
In between the South African duo, they bowled 25 dot balls with India scoring only 19 runs in six Powerplay overs.
Both Rodrigues and Harmanpreet were out when they were beaten by away turn from Mlaba and leg-spinner Sune Luus with keeper Sinalo Jafta effecting smart stumping.

"Despite gulf in class, India hope to overcome Holger Rune’s Denmark in Davis Cup playoffs","""We are playing a team that has a top 10 player, who on paper, is supposed to give them 2 out of 5 points. Our highest-ranked player is outside of the 350 mark,"" coach Zeeshan Ali told The Indian Express.","India take on Denmark, led by World No. 9 Holger Rune, in a playoff tie to stay in the World Group 1 stage of the Davis Cup starting on Friday. The Indian team lost 1-3 in their World Group 1 tie against Norway last year, forcing them into a playoff to keep their place at this stage.
Previewing Friday’s tie, team India coach Zeeshan Ali has revealed that the team are aware of what’s at stake, which has ramped up the pressure in the buildup. But they are not going to get carried away in the process. “We are playing a team that has a top 10 player, who on paper, is supposed to give them 2 out of 5 points. Our highest-ranked player is outside of the 350 mark,” Zeeshan told The Indian Express.
India have managed to keep their place in World Group 1 ever since the new Davis Cup format came into effect in 2019. This time last year, they had to go through a playoff against Denmark only, thrashing them 4-0 on the grass courts of the Gymkhana Club in New Delhi.

However, that was a Danish team without Rune, whose remarkable ascent in global tennis last year propelled him to the top 10 in the singles rankings. The 19-year-old also won the Paris Masters, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final, in October.
Bolstered by the home crowd in Hillerod, Denmark, in favourable conditions on indoor hard courts, Rune will have the upper hand, tipping the scales in Denmark’s favour. “We didn’t have to play Rune in Delhi (last year), and that gave us a huge advantage. He is not the World No. 9 without a reason,” he said. “Plus, the courts have been laid out to suit his game and to give the Danish team the maximum advantage.”
India’s team selection for the singles rubbers has been strategic in that way. Zeeshan believes that to have a chance, scores need to be 1-1 after Friday’s play. For that, India have gone with Sumit Nagal as their top player, who will take on Danish No. 2 August Holmgren, while Yuki Bhambri will play Rune in the opening tie on Friday.
For Zeeshan, the picks were made according to the suitability to the conditions. “We needed to do something different this tie and take all things into consideration. We are hoping Sumit will get us the 1 point on the first day,” he added.
Nagal, whose 2022 season was derailed due to injury, is the last Indian singles player to have played in the main draw of a Grand Slam. By entrusting him with the crucial fixture, non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal and Zeeshan have decided that he remains India’s best hope in singles.
Bopanna return
ADVERTISEMENT
India slumped to a disappointing defeat in Norway. Despite playing a team that had a player of the quality of Ruud, they would feel like they missed an opportunity to at least take it deep, by losing the doubles tie. That faith would be renewed thanks to the return of veteran Rohan Bopanna, fresh off a run to the Australian Open mixed doubles final with Sania Mirza, who played a pivotal role in India’s win in New Delhi last year.
“Having Rohan on the team definitely tips the balance in our favour. Especially if we are not playing against an established doubles pair,” Zeeshan said, before cautioning that there is still understanding to be developed between the 42-year-old and his partner, whom he does not play with regularly.
Bopanna is scheduled to play alongside Bhambri in doubles, and open the day’s play on Saturday. If the need arises for a fourth match, the two countries’ premier singles players, Nagal and Rune, will clash after the doubles.
Both Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Ramkumar Ramanathan remain in India’s ranks and can be subbed in for a last-minute change. Denmark’s decision to leave Rune out of the doubles may change if the tie is 1-1 going into the match, which could lead to Ramanathan replacing Bhambri as Bopanna’s partner. Either one of the duo could also be called upon for a potential tie-breaking fifth match on Saturday.

Don’t think new format was good for Davis Cup: Zeeshan
This year will be the last edition of the revamped Davis Cup format, after Spanish company Kosmos’ multi-billion dollar, 25-year partnership came to an abrupt end. The new format saw qualifying rounds via playoffs throughout the year, with the culmination of the event in a week-long, 16-team finals event in Spain in November.
Zeeshan, who was a member of the 1987 Indian team that reached the Davis Cup final, was not a fan of the new format, saying that the home-and-away format is what made the 125-year-old competition work. “I don’t think the format that ITF implemented the last couple of years was good for Davis Cup. It’s not what Davis Cup is all about,” he said.

League Cup final first in 35 years to allow safe standing,"Wembley Stadium, which seats 90,000 spectators, will have standing areas behind each goal, with 867 seats available to both clubs' fans in the East and West Stands.","The League Cup final between Manchester United and Newcastle United on Feb. 26 will have safe standing areas, marking the first time in 35 years that some fans can stand at a domestic final, the English Football League (EFL) said on Thursday.’
Wembley Stadium, which seats 90,000 spectators, will have standing areas behind each goal, with 867 seats available to both clubs’ fans in the East and West Stands.
Grounds in England’s top divisions were converted to all-seater stadiums nearly 30 years ago after Liverpool supporters were crushed in over-crowded and fenced-in areas at the Hillsborough Stadium in 1989, which led to 97 deaths.
“In these areas, fans are allowed to stand for matches in allocated spaces behind a barrier or a rail which prevents them from falling forward,” the EFL said in a statement.
“In all other areas of the stadium supporters must remain seated.”
The decision follows a trial where clubs like Cardiff City, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur offered licensed standing in designated seated areas for home and away fans.

Tokyo Olympic bribery scandal rolls on; company apologizes,"Takeshi Natsuno, president of the Japanese entertainment company Kadokawa, bowed deeply with two other executives to show remorse in a news conference. He said the company “seriously betrayed public trust.”","A Japanese company embroiled in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic corruption scandal said Thursday it would strengthen oversight to prevent further wrongdoing.
Takeshi Natsuno, president of the Japanese entertainment company Kadokawa, bowed deeply with two other executives to show remorse in a news conference. He said the company “seriously betrayed public trust.” Tsuguhiko Kadokawa, the son of the founder, was arrested in September on suspicion of bribing Haruyuki Takahashi, a member of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee, with 69 million yen ($480,000).
Kadokawa Group was chosen as an Olympic sponsor and published the Games program and guidebooks.
Takahashi is a former executive at the Japanese advertising company Dentsu, which played a key role in 2013 in landing the Olympics for Tokyo, and then became the Tokyo Games marketing arm.
Takahashi was arrested and released from jail after being held for about four months. Japanese media say he is denying the corruption charges.
He also faces bribery allegations in connection with several companies tied to the Tokyo Olympics: Aoki Holdings, a clothing company that dressed Japan’s Olympic team; Daiko Advertising Inc., ADK Marketing Solutions, and Sun Arrow, which produced the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic mascots named Miraitowa and Someity.
Any trials are likely to be slow moving as the Japanese court process tends to be drawn out, and more than a dozen people are involved.
Prosecutors say Takahashi acted in ways to favor the companies with sponsorships and other benefits related to the Olympics in return for the bribes.

Prosecutors say, besides the bribery scandal, a separate probe is ongoing into bid-rigging and the choice of venues for Olympic test events.
The sprawling corruption allegations surrounding Tokyo have caused the bid by the northern Japanese city of Sapporo for the 2030 Winter Games to be placed “on hold.” Sapporo was considered the favorite for 2030, partially because of Japan’s reliability and heavy spending to hold the delayed Tokyo Games.
The Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee is reported to have Salt Lake City as the lone candidate to hold the 2030 Games.
Salt Lake organizers have said they would prefer 2034, not wanting to directly follow Los Angeles, which will hold the 2028 Summer Olympics.
The official price tag for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics was $13 billion, although a government audit suggested real costs might be twice that much. About 60% of Tokyo Olympic spending was public money.

"Indian Hockey: Caldas, Aikman in fray for head coach’s position, HI unlikely to consider Indian names","According to a HI source, the federation is in talks with a two to three prospective foreign names after the position fell vacant following Australian Reid's resignation post joint ninth place finish.","Argentine Max Caldas and Dutchman Siegfried Aikman are in contention to replace Graham Reid as Indian men’s hockey team head coach after the recent World Cup debacle, sources in Hockey India said.
According to a HI source, the federation is in talks with a two to three prospective foreign names after the position fell vacant following Australian Reid’s resignation post joint ninth place finish.
“We expected the team to raise its performance after the Tokyo Olympics bronze medal win but it all went downhill. Reid has done a remarkable job and helped India win an Olympic medal but of late, the performance of the team dipped alarmingly,” the source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.
“We are in talks with 2-3 candidates but rest assured we will bring the best who can take India to the next level.” It has been learnt that apart from Caldas, Dutchman Aikman, who has not been paid for the last 10 months by Pakistan Hockey Federation is a serious contender to take up India job.
When queried if any Indian name will be considered for the post, he replied,”Please tell me who do you think is the best coach in India currently. If you give us names, we will definitely consider.” “The Asian Games is scheduled this year and the Paris Olympics is next year so whoever comes will have to deliver in both the events. We want the team to be at its best in both the tournaments,” he added.
Australian Reid, who joined the national team in April 2019, was part of the Indian team that won a historic bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics and silver medal at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.
But he had to quit after the host nation failed to qualify for the quarterfinals of the World Cup, which concluded last month in Odisha.
Reid’s term was till next year’s Paris Olympics, subject to review after the World Cup.

"Bengal in driver’s seat vs Jharkhand, aims third semifinal appearance on trot","At stumps on Day 3, Jharkhand were ahead by just seven runs, with their second innings in disarray at 162 for 7. A total of 11 wickets tumbled on day three.","Bengal are on course to their third successive Ranji Trophy semifinal appearance after Shahbaz Ahmed produced yet another sparkling all-round show to put them in the driver’s seat on the third day of their quarterfinal match against Jharkhand here on Thursday.
Batting at No. 6, left-hander Ahmed top-scored with a gritty 81 off 120 balls (9×4, 2×6) as Bengal posted 328 in their first innings to secure a healthy first innings lead of 155 runs.
At stumps on Day 3, Jharkhand were ahead by just seven runs, with their second innings in disarray at 162 for 7. A total of 11 wickets tumbled on day three.
The lower order Jharkhand batters are now left battling to delay the inevitable with two more days left in the game.
Ahmed, the left-arm spin bowling all-rounder, also made an impact with the ball, dismissing Anukul Roy (40) and Jharkhand skipper Virat Singh (29) in their second innings.
Opener Aryaman Sen waged a lone battle for Jharkhand with a fighting half century (64 off 132 balls) but Ishan Porel brilliantly set him up with a bouncer and dismissed him at the fag-end of the day.

It was a total batting failure for Jharkhand as only three batters managed double digit figures with Aryaman stitching two fifty-plus stands with Anukul Roy and then with Singh.

The match could have been over on day three itself had it not been for Bengal’s sloppy catching as they dropped three sitters, including two by skipper Tiwary, all off the bowling of Ahmed who finished the day with bowling figures of 12-2-38-2.
Shahbaz Nadeem was unbeaten on 4 off 13 deliveries, smashing Porel through cover boundary that handed Jharkhand a small overall lead. Giving him company at stumps was Supriyo Chakraborty on five off 19 balls.
It also meant that Jharkhand avoided an innings defeat but they were left to fight two more days with Rahul Shukla and Ashish Kumar next in line to bat.
Earlier, resuming the day on 238 for 5, Bengal lost their keeper-batter Abishek Porel (33) with just eight runs added to his overnight total.

The left-hander, who was looking fluent, suddenly lost his concentration and was caught behind after going for a loose shot.
The other overnight batter Shahbaz, however, did not put a foot wrong and played an attacking innings en route to his 10th fifty.
Bengal would have liked to swell their lead a bit more but Akash Deep failed to produce his lower order fireworks and was run-out after being involved in a mix-up with Ahmed.
“Our bowlers fought well. But we need to stick to our plans and get them out early and chase it down. Anything is possible in cricket, so we have to be at the top of our game tomorrow,” Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla said.

How Kohli and Pujara’s issues against spin can be exploited by Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy,"In the absence of Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, the top order’s troubles against spinners raises concerns about India’s batting on home turners","After the heroic last-ball, last-wicket, last-session draw New Zealand squeezed out in Kanpur the year before, Rahul Dravid handed curator Shiv Kumar a cheque of Rs 35,000. The coach was not exactly pleased with the surface Kumar had put together—“the turn was low and slow, did not wear and tear,” he would complain—but found joy in the crowd getting to watch a game that lasted a full five days. “It had everything a Test match could offer, quality cricket as well as drama. The match was alive till the final ball, which is a victory for Test cricket.”
A Test match lasting all five days in India is an utter rarity in India. Since Australia’s trenchant draw in Ranchi, in 2017, it has happened just thrice in 18 games, one of which was a rain-curtailed one in Eden Gardens. From 2021, the average days-span of a Test match has been 3.6 days. The much-maligned villain of the piece has been the pitch, the raging, kinking turners, where the skilled and shrewd spinners have woven an artful web of infallibility. Their numbers bewilder—Axar Patel has gobbled up 39 sticks at 12.83, Ravi Ashwin 58 at 13.98 and Ravindra Jadeja, who missed the England series due to an injury 15 at 16.
Kohli’s lbw fear and Pujara’s troubles against left-arm spinners
But in the result-driven, advantage-stretching, supremacy-setting quest, two of India’s most prolific contemporary batsmen have withered in their own climes, the same climes that nursed and nurtured them. In this span. Virat Kohli, undoubtedly the leading light of this generation, averages 23.25; the second most experienced one, Cheteshwar Pujara, aggregates 22.80. This is not an accusation that they have forgotten to play spin bowling, not with 8119 and 7014 runs, a collective haul of 46 Test hundreds. But in the final passage of their career, the two stalwarts of Indian cricket have stumbled onto an unusual nemesis, spin bowlers on subcontinental surfaces.
In 11 of Kohli’s 15 outings in Asia, a spinner has devoured him, six times by left-arm spinners and on five instanced by off-spinners. Similarly, 10 of Pujara’s 14 excursions have ended in the hands of a spinner, eight times by left-arm spinners and twice by off-break practitioners. There were some freak dismissals, like Cheteshwar Pujara’s full-bloodied pull thudding off the short-leg fielder’s back and looping in the air in the first Test against England, or Virat Kohli undone by a shooter in Bangalore against Sri Lanka. There were some genuinely unplayable deliveries too. One that leapt off the rough, one that ripped off the surface. Such aberrations aside, most of the dismissals stemmed from flawed judgement.

The lbw fear spooks Kohli. Moeen Ali probably sowed the doubts in the second innings of the second Test against England in Chennai. Kohli was batting sumptuously when he hung back and tried to work the ball off his legs. Ali was bowling around the stumps and so Kohli shuffled a fraction more across than he tends to, but missed the ball altogether and was nailed in front. Thereafter, whether he was duelling a left-arm spinner or an off-spinner, he would be in two minds. Whether to press forward or hang back. In this existential confusion of batsmen, he would often be neither here nor here. Ali cut the wound open again, in the second innings in Oval, when he made the ball hold the line, probably a natural variation, to have him nicked at first slip.
Thereafter, his suspicion on his spin-playing ability became a worm inside his head. A raft of nondescript bowlers, from Ajaz Patel to Lasith Embuldeniya and Dhananjaya de Silva preyed on his wounded mind. Now the perceived weakness mutated into a real one. It fully manifested in Bangladesh, where he would experiment with his stance – shifting from middle to leg-stump guard – and trigger movement but with little change of fortune.
ADVERTISEMENT
Whatever happened to once strong back-foot play, where he would just shift back and work the ball through the off-side or down the ground. He still does move back, but instead of showing the full phase, he closes the bat face. Kohli, of course, has tamed such beasts in the past, like the mastering of James Anderson in 2018. How he overcomes his latest flaw would be an enthralling storyline. His encounters against Nathan Lyon has the potential to be the tour de force of the series.
The spin vulnerability of Pujara was the exact opposite in nature of Kohli’s. He was taunted by the left-armer’s stock ball, the away-goer. He has a tendency to just thrust his front-pad, a half-press rather, with the bat behind the pad, suggesting his intention to leave the ball untouched. It’s a method that has benefited him. The bowler would then would then start bowling at his stumps and he would just work it through the leg-side. But sometime during the England series, he started getting sucked into the inward angle, sometimes drift, of Jack Leach. When the ball suddenly turned away, he would grope with a slightly angled bat-face and edge. Another habit too winked in, he started playing from the crease rather than stepping out, which often landed him in no man’s land. But Pujara, the survivor that he is, kicked away the bad habits in Bangladesh. More definitive with his footwork, more assertive in his stroke-play, he rediscovered his touch in Bangladesh, showed how a calm assessment and concentration can work, and ended his nearly three-year-long century drought.

Nonetheless, there are imperfections in the spin-game of India’s two most prolific run-getters of this era, making them the perfect fall guys for old-timers to lament about contemporary Indian batsmen’s ineptness against spin. It was not like turners were nonexistent in the 80s, 90s and the aughts, not like there was a paucity of quality spinners. Probably, there were better spinners, two of the all-time greats, in Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, besides nearly-great ones like Saqlain Mushtaq and Mushtaq Ahmed.
But Saqlain apart, no one prospered in India. Muralitharan averaged 45.45, double his overall number, Shane Warne’s corresponding number is 43.11 Twinkled-toed, velvet-handed batsmen with rubbery hands, would whimsically, instinctively destroy them.
ADVERTISEMENT
Their successors, perceptibly, are not as proficient. Yet, evidence has been tumbling out of the cupboard, even in white-ball formats, where India batsmen twist their face at the sight of a turner. Touring spinners do descend with a whiff of hope, unlike the no-hopers of the 90s or the aughts. Not without reason, as they have unearthed success. Just that whatever they do, Indian spinners out-do them. Steve O’Keefe spun Australia to a famous win in Pune; both he and Nathan Lyon grabbed 19 wickets apiece; the bespectacled Jack Leach scythed them in Chepauk; Ajaz Patel grabbed an innings 10-for, latest, Bangladesh’s spinners unleashed mayhem in the recent Test series.
The absence of Pant and Shreyas
Worse, India would be without their two most destructive batsmen of spin bowling in the middle order, Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer. Without Pant’s heroics, England could have squared the series, and without Iyer’s assuredness, both New Zealand and Sri Lanka could have pushed for a victory.
India’s Shreyas Iyer, left, and Rishabh Pant run between the wickets to score during the second day of the second cricket test match between Bangladesh and India. (AP)
Iyer’s replacement Suryakumar Yadav has been masterly against spinners in the shorter versions as well as in domestic cricket, but he is untested at this level. The promise he possesses is immense—honed in the classical Mumbai school of batting against spin. He does step out, has an assortment of sweeps and unpacks the slog, an ungainly but precious weapon on turners, one even Sachin Tendulkar often resorted to. Pant’s potential replacement KS Bharat is more of an old-school accumulator, and an unknown on turners. Up the order, KL Rahul was dodgy against the spinners in Bangladesh, though his heroics of the past fill hope.
Even Rohit Sharma, whose 161 at a Chepauk was a textbook innings on nullifying spinners on a turning track, has not been consistent against spinners. Though he is arguably the most natural player of spin bowling in the top-six, and the best sweeper in the team, left-arm spinners have not left him unharmed. The last five of his nine dismissals in Asia were masterminded by the ilk (Leach 4, Embuldeniya 1). So he is not foolproof to spin vicissitudes either.
ADVERTISEMENT
It holds true for the whole team, it’s the left-arm spinners that have surfaced as the tormentors. Of the 105 Indian wickets spinners have captured since the tour of England, left-armers have accounted for 67. It could be that there are more left-arm spinners around than leg-spinners or off-spinners, nonetheless it is no coincidence that a left-spinner was the wrecker in chief in the three of India’s last four home defeats (2012 Mumbai, 2017 Pune, and 2021 Chennai). Interestingly, none of them have been the modern-day stump-to-stump flat-trajectory merchants, but more old-school operators, tossing, drifting and dropping the ball. Only one among the quartet Australia have packed for India is a left-arm spinner—Ashton Agar, whose Test career has been erratic. But so have been the career trajectories of Monty Panesar, Steve O’Keefe and Jack Leach.

Bairstow’s recovery from freak injury on ‘right track’; batter indicates he is keen on Ashes return,Bairstow had broken his leg and dislocated his ankle when he slipped on a golf course in September last year and missed the T20 World Cup in Australia and the subsequent away Test tour of Pakistan.,"England’s multi-format middle-order batter Jonny Bairstow’s chances of being part of the national team for the home Ashes series have brightened as he says his recovery from a freak injury is on “right track”.
Bairstow had broken his leg and dislocated his ankle when he slipped on a golf course in September last year and missed the T20 World Cup in Australia and the subsequent away Test tour of Pakistan.
The grievous injury saw the 33-year-old break his fibula in three places, which required complicated surgical intervention. With the Ashes scheduled at home in June-July this year, a fully-fit Bairstow should be an automatic choice in the squad as the firepower he lends to England’s batting is unmatched.
Bairstow was in the form of his life last year, averaging 75.66 with four Test centuries before he was struck down by the injury.
“It (the leg) is improving, we’re on the right track, we’re about four-and-a-half months post it (the injury) happening now,” Bairstow said at the Marylebone Cricket Club ‘spirit of cricket’ panel on Wednesday, according to ‘Yorkshire Post’.
The cricketer, who was a part of England’s Test resurgence under coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes, however, has not set a return date, though he remains optimistic about the Ashes.
“I haven’t actually got a return date just yet but I’m seeing a surgeon later on in the month so we’ll wait and see how that goes, but things are tracking in the right direction.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s (injury) a bit more complicated than just breaking your leg, but that’s just one of the things that you deal with. Everyone has been dealt a card, everyone has challenges put in front of them, but it’s just another thing you can overcome.” He added that while the long layoff has not quite affected his morale, staying at home, at times, became boring.
“It’s been a lot different (post the injury), taking the injury away from it, not being … on planes and flying everywhere and being around a group of lads, being at home has been a lot different.
“It’s been quite good at times, it’s been quite boring at times.” Bairstow said that a day before he slipped on the golf course, white-ball coach Matthew Mott and skipper Jos Buttler were discussing with him the prospects of opening the innings in T20Is.
“It has been tricky, obviously the night before I did my ankle, I spoke to Matthew Mott and Jos (Buttler) and they spoke about me opening the batting in T20 side and that’s what I’ve been wanting to do for a little period of time, so I was absolutely delighted.

"Avoid dressing room banter bordering on bullying, racial harassment: Strauss","The Pakistan-born cricketer, who played for county side Yorkshire for almost a decade, had told UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) in November 2021 that racist comments and actions by fellow cricketers had left him ""close to taking his own life"".","Former England captain Andrew Strauss has urged cricketers to avoid dressing room banter bordering on racial harassment and bullying in order to avert controversies like the Azeem Rafiq fiasco.
The Pakistan-born cricketer, who played for county side Yorkshire for almost a decade, had told UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) in November 2021 that racist comments and actions by fellow cricketers had left him “close to taking his own life”.
Strauss, the former England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) director of cricket, said during his Marylebone Cricket Club Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s on Wednesday that with players of different nationalities and races now sharing dressing rooms more than ever, cricketers will have to be more guarded in what they say and do.
“As we move forward together as a game with players of different genders, races, creeds and beliefs coming together, so the traditional macho, hierarchical, perhaps at times verging on bullying dressing-room banter will need to be softened to a culture that is more tolerant, understanding, welcoming and embracing of difference,” Strauss, one of the most successful England captains, was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.
Strauss also highlighted the significance of the spirit of cricket, saying the events of the last year-and-a-half — when the Azeem Rafiq scandal unfolded and tarnished the image of England cricket — had shown a lot more needed to be done to restore the image of the game.
“Perhaps more importantly the spirit of cricket needs to accompany modern players and I am speaking primarily about the men’s game now into an area that neither the prying eyes of the media or the feverish adulation of the fans penetrates; the dressing room,” Strauss said.
“The events over the last 18 months, whether they come from Yorkshire or elsewhere have shown we have a lot of work to do in this area, but the spirit of cricket demands this.” With England winning nine of the 10 Tests under coach Brendon McCullum and skipper Ben Stokes, Strauss said the coming together of the duo had brought about a huge tactical shift in the way the longest format is being played now.

England’s run of victories in Tests against India, New Zealand, South Africa and Pakistan last year saw them erase the disappointment of having won just one in 17 games before the pair was appointed.
“The coming together of Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes in May last year has shifted the game of Test cricket from its foundations and has asked some fundamental questions of the centuries-old accepted truths of the Test format,” said Strauss.
“What those two extraordinary leaders of men — aided in no small part by Rob Key as director of cricket — have done, is redefine once again what the game of cricket is actually about.” With a lot of talk about Test cricket losing its significance amid the onslaught of domestic T20 leagues across the world, Strauss indicated that the popularity of traditional rivalries like the Ashes and series between major Test-playing nations will never go out of fashion, though some debt-laden national governing bodies could be at a disadvantage.
“It is inevitable that some old institutions might creak at the seams, including some debt-laden national governing bodies and professional clubs,” said Strauss.

The importance of Campbell Johnstone coming out as gay: The first All Black,"""The public will know that there is one in amongst the All Blacks"".","Former New Zealand rugby player Campbell Johnstone became the first All Black to come out as gay, saying he hoped to “take away the pressure and the stigma” of doing so publicly.
The 43-year-old said spoke bravely in a Seven Sharp TV interview, and his decision was met with support and gratitude from the larger rugby community, with hopes that his visibility and strength in talking about being gay, will pave the way for others in a sport that is saddled with an excessively macho image and stereotypes. Here’s why Johnstone is being hailed by all.
When did Johnstone make the All Blacks squad?
The former tighthead prop debuted against Fiji as All Black #1056 and played three Tests in 2005, with his last two matches against the British and Irish Lions. Between 2002 and 2012, he made 38 appearances for the Crusaders, 72 for Canterbury and 105 for the French side Biarritz.
Why this is big and of immense importance and exceedingly difficult earlier?
Johnstone explained that while he had told friends and family “a long time ago” that he was gay, he kept the matter private during his playing career, leading a “double life” and “living a lie” because his sexuality did not fit with “his image of an All Black,” he said.

“Within myself, I was never really comfortable with the whole concept,” said Johnstone. “My dream was to be an All Black.”
How did he visualize an All Black player for the national side back then?
ADVERTISEMENT
Johnstone said he thought of All Blacks as someone who was “manly, strong … possibly had a wife, kids”, and he blamed his sexuality when he played poorly, according to NZ Herald. “Manly, strong, possibly had a wife and kids. I’d pushed that side of me down deeper and deeper; I’ve been to some interesting places with that. It would come to the surface and I may have had a bad game, and I would look at that side of me and blame that for it. It slowly starts to affect you. It’s hard living a double life, or living a lie,” he said.
Why did he feel the need to come out?
In the same interview he would say he realised he was living “a double life” and “living a lie,” trying to portray the stereotypes of a rugby player. He continued: “We had a phrase in rugby saying if you could look yourself in the mirror and be honest with yourself then you’ve done enough. Here I was looking in the mirror, haven’t been honest with my teammates; and that puts a lot of pressure on and just builds up on you.”
What did Johnstone say about his decision?
“If I open up that door and magically make that closet disappear, then we’re going to help a lot of people.” He added that previously he wanted to keep his sexuality private. “Telling close friends and rugby mates was enough for me. I’m very happy and comfortable about myself,” he told Seven Sharp.
“There’s no rule, there’s no law about coming out. You don’t have to come out. If you feel it’s not right for you, then don’t. The idea of an ideal rugby player or Crusader, is of an honest, strong person. The stronger you are, and if you can make yourself stronger by relieving anxiety and stress, then you can fit that mould.
“In some part I’m disappointed it’s taken me so long to do this, then there’s the other aspect that I’m somewhat maybe a little bit sad we are actually having to do this. If I open up that door and magically make that closet disappear then we’re going to help a lot of people.” It was about shattering the ultimate stereotype: “The public will know that there is one in amongst the All Blacks.”
What were the reactions?

“New Zealand’s sports minister, Grant Robertson, who is also gay, said Johnstone had blazed a trail for the national team – which is dominant on the world stage, venerated at home and has become a multi-billion dollar global brand,” wrote NZ Herald. He wrote on Instagram: “There is still a long way to go, but feels like a very significant step,” Robertson wrote in an Instagram post. “It’s important to create an inclusive environment in sport at all levels, and that starts at the top. In the Black Ferns we have had role models for the Rainbow community for some time. And now with the All Blacks another barrier has been broken. I hope it inspires future generations to be open, happy and comfortable. There is still a long way to go, but feels a very significant step. And from one prop to another, nga mihi Campbell!”
In a message posted on Twitter, Mark Robinson, the CEO of New Zealand Ruby and a former teammate of Johnstone’s, said the former player’s “strength and visibility will pave the way” for other players.
“We know that there are people who have not always been comfortable to be who they are in rugby,” Robinson wrote. “We want to be clear, no matter who you love, rugby has your back.”
Is Johnstone New Zealand’s first international to come out?

No, Johnstone is not New Zealand’s first international rugby player to come out. The national women’s team – has multiple openly gay current and past players in Black Ferns, including Louisa Wall, a former member of parliament who was part of the winning side at the 1995 Women’s Rugby World Cup. “But it has been much rarer for men in the sport’s top echelons to come out publicly. In 2009, the former Wales captain Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay professional rugby union player in the World,” NZH wrote.
What did the players’ community say?
All Black scrum-half Brad Weber tweeted: “Legend! Hugely influential moment for so many young people, rugby players especially, who might be questioning their sexuality. Much respect, Campbell.”
The All Blacks shared support for Johnstone as the segment went to air, praising him for “having the courage to share his story and helping create a more inclusive game.”
World Cup-winning Black Fern Ruby Tui shared a message of support for Johnstone. “I try to fight for the rainbow every day but what Campbell Johnson has just done for the rainbow community within rugby is probably more than I’ve ever done. Thank you brother,” she wrote on Twitter.

‘A slap on Pakistan cricket’: Misbah ul Haq slams PCB for Mickey Aurther’s appointment as ‘online coach’,Misbah blamed former Pakistan players for damaging the credibility of the system and making PCB look outside the home territory for coaching roles.,"Former Pakistan head coach Misbah ul Haq has slammed Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for appointing Mickey Aurther as an online coach and termed the move as “a slap on Pakistan cricket”.
“It’s a slap on our cricket system that we are not able to find a high-profile full-time coach,” Misbah told ESPNcricinfo.
Arthur is likely to return to Pakistan as its team director following Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Najam Sethi’s arrival. Misbah blamed former Pakistan players for damaging the credibility of the system and making PCB look outside the home territory for coaching roles.
“It is a shame that the best ones do not want to come and we insist on having someone who is looking at Pakistan as a second option. I blame our own system, which is vulnerable enough with so many weak lines for anyone to exploit it. We are to be blamed ourselves that we have disrespected and discredited our own people to make a bad image. The present and former lot do not respect each other, with media and former players using their own YouTube channels for ratings, grossly hitting the credibility and value of our cricket which, as as result, gives an impression that we are not capable.”
“The Pakistan cricket fan is always disgruntled; he is picking up things from the media and is under the wrong impression. Players speaking against each other with grudges and talking openly with disdain just devalues our community, and that becomes the common perception. Our cricket has been constantly under pressure with wavered and subjective opinions. The game is hardly a subject of objective and constructive discussion,” he said.
“Cricket is the most popular sport in the country but sadly never hits the headlines in the right way. It is chaos; former cricketers ridiculing their fellow cricketers on national channels with fans getting the wrong sense. There is no empathy, no respect, and no conducive environment in the cricketing quarter of our country,” Misbah concluded.
The Pakistan Cricket Board will appoint Arthur’s assistant who will be in charge of the team on the ground in his absence.
Earlier, Arthur had expressed disappointment with Misbah ul Haq and said that Misbah and Akram were two people he had brought into the hierarchy of cricket administration in Pakistan only for them to not “follow through”.
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking to ESPNCricinfo, Arthur said, “I guess the only disappointment I have out of the whole lot (being removed from the Pakistan job after the World Cup) is that there were some people I really trusted who ultimately didn’t follow through.”
Arthur said he had recommended Misbah and Akram’s names when a cricket committee was first being put together by PCB chairman Ehsan Mani. “I said Misbah would be outstanding because he was a godfather of Pakistan cricket – Misbah is an outstanding individual make no mistake about that,” Arthur said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/a-slap-on-pakistan-cricket-misbah-ul-haq-slams-pcb-for-mickey-aurthers-appointment-as-online-coach-8419419/,sports
‘There is nothing left’: Lionel Messi drops retirement hint,Lionel Messi won the FIFA World Cup in December 2022 against France in Qatar.,"Lionel Messi has seemingly dropped a subtle hint bout retirement. At the same time, the World Cup winner has not given a date or time for his retirement but has now admitted that “there’s nothing left” for him in the game.
Messi, a winner of multiple Ballon d’Or awards, has also won the UEFA Champions League and domestic league titles and cups. The only trophy missing from his bucket list before last year was the World Cup, but now he has that in his cabinet.
Stating that he has achieved everything there was to be achieved with the national team, the 35-year-old Argentine superstar said, “It’s at the end of my career, closing a cycle.”
“I achieved everything with the national team I always dreamed. I got everything in my career, individually. It was about uniquely closing my career. I never imagined that all this would happen to me when I started, and getting to this moment was the best. I have no complaints, and I can’t ask for more. We won the Copa America [in 2021] and the World Cup; there’s nothing left,” he said in an interview with UrbanaPlay.
“I would have liked Diego to give me the cup, or at least to see all this, to see Argentina as world champions, with everything he wanted and how he loved the national team. I think from above, he – like many people who love me – was strong,” he said.
Incidentally, Messi had shocked the world when he announced his retirement from international football after Argentina’s defeat to Chile in the final of the Copa America Centenario in 2016.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/there-is-nothing-left-lionel-messi-drops-retirement-hint-8419342/,sports
Australian Open director: Novak Djokovic’s hamstring had 3-cm tear,Djokovic won the trophy at Melbourne Park on Sunday by beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets for a record-extending 10th title there and record-tying 22nd Grand Slam trophy overall. Rafael Nadal is the only other man who has won that many majors.,"Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said Novak Djokovic played at the Grand Slam event with a muscle tear of 3 centimeters — a little more than an inch — in his left hamstring along the way to winning the championship.
“He gets a bad rap, but at the end of the day, I don’t think anyone can question his athleticism. This guy, I did see, he had a 3-centimeter tear in his hammy,” Tiley said Wednesday in an interview with SEN Sportsday.
“The doctors are … going to tell you the truth,” Tiley said. “I think there was a lot of speculation of whether it was true or not. It’s hard to believe that someone can do what they do with those types of injuries. But he’s remarkable.”
Djokovic won the trophy at Melbourne Park on Sunday by beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets for a record-extending 10th title there and record-tying 22nd Grand Slam trophy overall. Rafael Nadal is the only other man who has won that many majors.
The triumph also allowed Djokovic to return to No. 1 in the ATP rankings on Monday.
The 35-year-old from Serbia hurt his hamstring during a tune-up tournament in Adelaide ahead of the Australian Open. He wore a heavy bandage on his left thigh and was visited by trainers during matches in Week 1 in Melbourne.

Archer spent 17 months on the sidelines with back and elbow injuries before returning to international cricket in the one-day series in South Africa.
His career-best 6-40 helped secure England’s 59-run victory in Wednesday’s third one-dayer in Kimberley, though South Africa won the series 2-1.

“You only get that feeling after you start playing. It’s definitely gone up a few notches.
“It’s just a long road, this is a small tick but I want to see how I am in April, June, July and September. This is just the start of the road.”
Archer bled 81 runs for the lone wicket of lower order batsman Wayne Parnell in the series opener against South Africa.
But the 27-yer-old was at his menacing best on Wednesday – destroying stumps, hitting Aiden Markram with a bouncer and regularly exceeding 90 miles per hour.

“It was fantastic and probably deserving of the player of the match award,” captain Jos Buttler, who bagged the honour for his blistering hundred, said of Archer’s display.
“When the game was in the balance, to come back there and take the wicket of (Heinrich) Klaasen broke the game open for us.”

Lionel Messi scores but Mbappe injured as PSG win to move 5 points clear,Kylian Mbappé went down clutching his leg just under the right knee and limped off in the 21st minute — having earlier missed a twice-taken penalty and blazed the rebound over an open goal on his second effort.,"World Cup winner Lionel Messi scored and Kylian Mbappé missed a twice-taken penalty before getting injured as Paris Saint-Germain won 3-1 at Montpellier to move five points clear at the top of the French league on Wednesday.
Mbappé went down clutching his leg just under the right knee and limped off in the 21st minute — having earlier missed a twice-taken penalty and blazed the rebound over an open goal on his second effort.
It was unclear exactly what his injury was. Television cameras also caught him rubbing the back of his left thigh as he walked to the dressing room.
PSG coach Christophe Galtier told broadcaster Canal Plus “he took a blow behind the knee,” and then said at his news conference the injury does not appear serious.

Balogun, who started his career at Premier League club Arsenal, netted his treble against goalkeeper Vito Mannone, who also began his career at Arsenal, and even went close to a fourth goal near the end.

"How rugby is trying to speed up game: Six Nations introduces shot clock, bans pre-lineout huddles","The shot clock was introduced as part of World Rugby's measures to improve the spectacle of rugby and produce a “quicker, more entertaining game”. It will count down the 90 seconds allocated for each try conversion and 60 seconds for each penalty.","The Six Nations will be the first of major meets to use a shot clock to help speed up kicks at goal, according to stuff.Co.Nz. Goalkickers will need to watch out before taking their shots, but fans will not be able to see it in the first two rounds of the tournament.
The shot clock was introduced as part of World Rugby’s measures to improve the spectacle of rugby and produce a “quicker, more entertaining game”. It will count down the 90 seconds allocated for each try conversion and 60 seconds for each penalty.
Stuff wrote: “World Rugby says that it wants these timings to be “strictly adhered to” in the Six Nations. If a kicker misses their time, the shot at goal will be disallowed. If a penalty is not taken quickly enough, the opposing team will be awarded a scrum from the same mark. The Gallagher Premiership trialled this for the first time last weekend, and now the Six Nations will use the technology, starting from the opening round of games on Saturday.”
World rugby was keen the shot clock be shown on the big screens at stadiums, so supporters could see the time ticking down. “However, it is understood that it will not be visible at stadiums such as Twickenham to start with. Six Nations executives want to make sure the clock functions seamlessly for players, teams and fans before introducing it fully and making it visible to all later in the competition” stuff. Co. Nz wrote.
The way the technology works, referees will be linked up to the director running the clock, and will be told if a kicker has missed his allotted slot to take a penalty or conversion.
A Six Nations spokesman was quoted as saying: “Its operation will be trialled ‘off air’ in the first instance. Off-air trialling will be conducted during a live match-day environment, but will not be presented to fans in stadia, or through broadcast coverage.
“Consistency of how the shot clock technology is applied in a live match scenario is key to enhancing the experience for teams, players and fans, and Six Nations Rugby will review the trial of the technology, before making a decision on its future integration into matches. Across rugby, there is a collective support for the concept and its introduction to the game.”

Pre-lineout huddles will be banned in the Six Nations. Teams often discuss their throwing calls in huddles but these are now outlawed in the Six Nations. “Teams will also be told to form scrums within 30 seconds of the mark being made.

Amongst other time-saving measures,
World Rugby has also told Six Nations referees to speed up their use of the television match official, amid concern that reviews take too long and that this should be taken as a signal the offence is not “clear and obvious”. Officials have been told they should “attempt to make speedier decisions and limit replays when not necessary”as per stuff. Co. Nz.
The website additionally noted: “Teams are now permitted to use only two water carrier per match, after a crackdown when the South Africa director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, bent the rules, particularly during the 2021 British & Irish Lions series, to enter the field of play to coach the Springboks.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Steve Smith’s reboot that makes him so dangerous,"Steve Smith delved into the changes he brought about in his batting that have turned him into a run-machine, across all formats.","It all started after a not so bad series when he returned home ready to tweak his game, according to a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald. It started with the end of the trademark Smith shuffle.
“Smith had just played the series of his life, collaring 774 runs at 110.57 in four Tests on tricky English pitches to be the biggest single reason Australia retained the Ashes.
Yet it was in the aftermath of that achievement, perhaps even as soon as the flight home, that Smith started thinking about where to take his game next.
Over a long and sometimes tortuous journey, opponents harried him with short balls and leg-side fields, but Smith reached a point of resolution at the outset of this summer after he had abandoned his trademark shuffle across the crease in mid-year,” SMH wrote.
Speaking after winning his fourth Allan Border Medal in Sydney, Smith described his journey. “Probably in about 2019 when I came back here after the Ashes. It sounds really strange because that obviously had been a really good Ashes, but I felt like my mind was in a good place and I was playing really well in terms of my thinking and my mental side of the game.
“But I don’t think I was hitting the ball quite as well as I probably have done and then it probably exposed a couple of little weaknesses when I came back that I wanted to rectify.”
The India blueprint circa 2014-15
SMH wrote, ‘For Smith, the sweet spot of his career was the summer of 2014-15, when he dominated India and was the fulcrum of Australia’s ODI World Cup win on home soil. At the time, he was known to confide “no one knows how to get me out”, and batted like it. But from 2019, it took until a session in Adelaide – just before Australia would be eliminated from the Twenty20 World Cup – for all the components of feet, hands and weight transfer to get into sync. Smith’s first attempt to demonstrate the changes was derailed by COVID-19, which he carried into the game against Afghanistan.’

He would elaborate: “I’ve looked at footage for so long like you wouldn’t believe, just of innings mainly in 2015,” he said. “I think that was when I was batting my best in the Indian series at home and throughout that World Cup and that’s my blueprint that I always go back to, to try and figure out what I was doing there.

“I finally got there. I was in the nets. I think in might have been in Adelaide just before the T20 game against Afghanistan. I felt like I’d found something and then I got COVID.
“I played with COVID that game and I didn’t really get a chance to get in the middle to sort of implement it. And then the next game I played was against England and that game I think, I scored 80 not out.
“And yeah, that was just the first time I’d put it all into practice in the middle and it just clicked for me. We’re always looking for those things to make you better. Fortunate that I stumbled across it finally and hopefully, it keeps working well for me.”
ADVERTISEMENT
He would call a cover drive played at Adelaide as the single moment when he mouthed: “I’m back, baby”, SMH wrote, noting “across 16 innings in all formats since, Smith has hammered 1027 runs at 85.58 with four centuries.”
“It was probably that ball that I hit through the covers, just my weight transfer through the ball,” he was quoted. “The way my hands went through it and I’d felt it a little bit in the nets but I hadn’t implemented it in the game yet.
“So as soon as I hit that shot I was kind of like, I’ve just found something has clicked. It’s the rhythm I’ve been searching for and yeah, I made it pretty clear, I think straight away. So yeah, a bold statement but it felt as though it, you know, I’d nailed it.”

‘Hardik bhai told me to bat the way I do’: Shubman Gill after smashing 126* off 63 balls,"""It feels good when you practise and it pays off. Happy to get the big ones for the team. Everybody has a different technique to hit sixes,"" Gill said at the post-match presentation.","Opening batter Shubman Gill, who played a major role in India’s 168-run win over New Zealand to clinch the three-match T20I series with his maiden ton, on Wednesday said he did not do anything extra during his big knock.
Gill remained not out on 126 to help India post a massive 234 for 4 after electing to bat.
India then bowled New Zealand out for a meagre 66 in 12.1 overs to post their biggest win in terms of runs.
“It feels good when you practise and it pays off. Happy to get the big ones for the team. Everybody has a different technique to hit sixes,” Gill said at the post-match presentation.
“Hardik bhai told me to bat the way I do, and that there is no need to do anything extra. When you are representing your country, I don’t think there’s any kind of fatigue, and I am happy to play all three formats.” Captain Hardik Pandya said he normally goes by his gut feeling while taking decisions on the field.

“I have always played the game like this, tried to read the situation and what’s required at that moment, and not have pre-conceived ideas. A lot of time I back my guts,” said Pandya, who was named player-of-the-series.
“I have got a very simple rule about my life and captaincy — if I go down, I go down on my decisions. When I played the IPL final, I felt the second innings was more spicier. We want to normalise these pressure games, and hopefully we can do better at bigger stages.” A disappointed New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner gave credit to India for playing “outstanding” cricket.
“Some of their guys are in great nick at the moment. It is tough to win when you lose five wickets in the powerplay. It can be challenging when the ball is swinging.

“If you look at the way India played, they took their time early on and when it got flat, they really had a go at us,” Santner said.
Asked about the ODI World Cup in India later this year, Santner said, “I guess that time of the year there will be some dew around, most teams might bowl first.

"With newly-acquired boundary-clearing skill, classy Shubman is more dangerous than ever before","Following his 126 off 63 balls, Shubman Gill becomes only the fifth Indian batsman to score hundreds in all three international formats.","Those who watched Shubman Gill’s sublime hundred on Wednesday would struggle to decide which of his shots was the most memorable. Was it the languid cover drive in the first over that got him going or the frequent nonchalant flicks that sailed over the substantial boundaries at the spectacular stadium? Was it the delicate late cut towards the end of the innings when the temptation would have been to go hard at each ball or the straight hits off the spinners after dancing down the pitch?
The most pleasing aspect of Gill’s 126 off 63 balls – with 12 fours and seven sixes – was that every shot seemed more eye-catching than the previous one, with no hoicks across the line or too much premeditated movement before the ball arrived. His tall frame and easy reach makes him a treat to watch, and he has made a habit of making good form count across formats, as he notched up the highest individual T20I score by an Indian batsman.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/gill-hits-maiden-t20i-ton-as-india-beat-nz-with-biggest-run-margin-in-shortest-format-8418426/,sports
"Ranji Trophy: Vihari bats left-handed, helps Andhra reach 379; MP slumps to 144 for 4","Vihari's brave effort was reminiscent of his heroics in the Sydney Test against Australia in January 2021. Along with Ravichandran Ashwin, Vihari who had a hamstring injury, defied the Aussie bowlers for close to four hours to deny the opposition a win.","In an act of bravery, Andhra skipper Hanuma Vihari batted left-handed and defied the speedy Avesh Khan to add 26 runs for the 10th wicket to help the team reach 379 against Madhya Pradesh on the second day of the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal here on Wednesday.
Andhra then reduced the defending champions to 144 for 4 at stumps to seize control of the match.
Resuming at the overnight score of 262 for 2, things did not go Andhra’s way as the hard-working MP bowlers hit back after toiling hard during the massive 251-run stand between Ricky Bhui (149) and Karan Shinde (110).
Shinde reached his ton off 254 balls even as Bhui kept going to frustrate the home team’s bowling attack.
Medium-pacer Anubhav Agarwal (4 for 72) broke the partnership when he got Shinde to nick one to wicket-keeper Himanshu Mantri with the score at 323.
Five runs later, Bhui’s marathon innings ended when he was caught by Saransh Jain in the covers off Agarwal.
The MP bowlers then got into the act and struck at regular intervals to leave Andhra at 353 for 9 when Vihari walked in to bat.

Batting left-handed after injuring his left hand wrist, the Andhra captain managed to hit a couple of boundaries to make sure the team total swelled to 379. He batted with only one hand.
He was dismissed LBW by Jain for 27. He had retired hurt on Tuesday on 16 after being hit by a bouncer from Avesh Khan.
Vihari’s brave effort was reminiscent of his heroics in the Sydney Test against Australia in January 2021. Along with Ravichandran Ashwin, Vihari who had a hamstring injury, defied the Aussie bowlers for close to four hours to deny the opposition a win.
Abhimanyu, Gharami slam fifties, Bengal take first innings lead
Skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran and Sudip Gharami struck half centuries as Bengal took a slender first innings lead against Jharkhand on day two of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal here on Wednesday.

After bowling Jharkhand out for 173, Bengal were 238 for 5 at the end of the second day with a crucial 65-run first innings lead.
Abhimanyu (77) and Gharami (68) displayed a dominant show with the bat after rookie opener Kazi Junaid Saifi (1) was adjudged LBW off Ashish Kumar in the ninth over of the day.
From there on, Abhimanyu and Gharami added 136 runs for the second wicket to put the home side to touching distance of claiming a first innings lead.
But Bengal suffered a mid-innings collapse after the duo fell in quick succession as the home side went on to lose four wickets for the addition of 60 runs to be reduced to 207 for 5.
ADVERTISEMENT
Just when Bengal were staring at a batting debacle, the left-handed duo of Abhishek Porel (25) and and Shahbaz Ahmed (17) took control of the proceedings in an entertaining unbroken partnership.
The wickekteeper-batter Porel struck some delightful cover drives and the sloppy fielding by Jharkhand also helped Bengal’s cause.
For Jharkhand, Supriyo Chakraborty bagged two wickets while Ashish, Anukul Roy and Shahbaz Nadeem took one each.
“We are happy to take the first innings lead. But our aim will be to add as many runs as possible on Day 3, keeping in mind that in cricket, anything is possible,” Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla said.

“The partnership of Abhimanyu and Gharami was a vital one, but we have bigger targets ahead of us.” Brief Scores:
Jharkhand: 173 all out.
Batters put Karnataka in command against Uttarakhand
Karnataka, riding on veteran all-rounder Shreyas Gopal’s unbeaten 103, took a massive 358-run lead against Uttarakhand on day two of their Ranji Trophy quarter-final match here on Wednesday.
On a day when runs flowed freely for the hosts, skipper Mayank Agarwal (83) was involved in a 159-run opening partnership with Ravikumar Samarth (82) before Devdutt Padikkal (69) and Nikin Jose (62) too scored half centuries as Karnataka ended the day at 474 for five.
None of the Uttarakhand bowlers seemed effective against the batter-heavy Karnataka side at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, with pace bowler Deepak Dhapola, who had career-best figures of 8/35 in an innings during the Ranji Trophy group phase this season, returning empty-handed on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
With the Uttarakhand strike bowler seemingly ineffective, there were four half-centurions and a century-maker in Karnataka’s lineup. Commencing day two at 123 for no loss, overnight batters Agarwal and Samarth, who were on 65 and 54 respectively on Tuesday, flourished in favourable home conditions.
Prabhsimran, Naman hit centuries to give Punjab upper hand against Saurashtra
Openers Prabhsimran Singh and Naman Dhir struck sparkling centuries to give Punjab the upper hand on the second day of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal match against Saurashtra here on Wednesday.
Resuming the day at 3 for no loss in reply to Saurashtra’s first innings total of 303 all out, Punjab were 327 for 5 from 91 overs at the close of second day for a lead of 24 runs with Prabhsimran and Naman scoring 126 and 131 runs respectively.

Prabhsimran faced 158 balls from which he struck 13 fours and three sixes, while Naman hit nine fours and seven sixes during his 180-ball knock.
Prabhsimran was the first to go at the team score of 212 in the post-lunch session while Naman stayed a little longer and was the third Punjab batsman to get out.
One-down Pukhraj Mann (1), Anmolpreet Singh (9) and Nehal Wadhera (4) did not contribute much but captain Mandeep Singh and wicketkeeper Anmol Malhotra took Punjab past Suarashtra’s first innings total.
Mandeep was batting on 39 off 120 balls, while Malhotra was giving him company on 16 off 57 deliveries when the stumps were drawn.
For Saurashtra, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Yuvrajsinh Dodiya took wickets apiece while Parth Bhut got one.

On the opening day on Tuesday, left-arm spinner Parth Bhut shone with the bat and saved Saurashtra with a gritty 111 not out off 155 balls.

"Before Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Aussies skip practice games, use RCB connections to train on rank turners outside Bangalore",Australia are studying the footage of Axar Patel a lot as his release points and the turn and bounce he gets off the pitch is seen as a huge threat.,"Practice games used to be hitherto seen by visiting teams as an ideal preparation to get used to the tough Indian conditions. No longer though. Australia will play the first Test in Nagpur on February 9 without any tour games; instead they will have a four-day preparatory camp at Alur, in the outskirts of Bangalore. Pat Cummins’ Australian team has arrived on Indian shores, hoping to become the first captain since Alastair Cook’s England side in 2012 to win a series here.
Instead of the practice games, Australia will train on customised pitches at Alur. Thanks to head coach Andrew McDonald and spin consultant Daniel Vettori’s association with Royal Challengers Bangalore, it is understood that Australia thought having a preparatory camp for four days would be ideal preparation before they travel to Nagpur.

Khawaja granted visa to travel to India; to fly out on Thursday,"The Australian Test squad and support staff led by Pat Cummins had left for the team's training base in Bengaluru on two separate flights on Tuesday and Wednesday, but Khawaja couldn't board either as his passport and visa had not been delivered by the Indian high commission.","Australia opener Usman Khawaja was granted the visa late on Wednesday to travel to India for the Test series after the Pakistan-born cricketer was forced to miss the morning flight due to delay in the issuance of travel documents.
The passport and visa were handed over to a Cricket Australia (CA) representative late on Wednesday night in Melbourne, said a report in ‘Sydney Morning Herald’.
The Australian Test squad and support staff led by Pat Cummins had left for the team’s training base in Bengaluru on two separate flights on Tuesday and Wednesday, but Khawaja couldn’t board either as his passport and visa had not been delivered by the Indian high commission.
Khawaja will now board the flight from Melbourne to Bengaluru on Thursday and could attend the team’s training session on Friday, said the report.
The cricketer, after coming to know his visa documents had not been processed, had taken to social media on Wednesday afternoon to express his frustration.
“Me waiting for my Indian Visa like… #stranded #dontleaveme #standard #anytimenow,” Khawaja wrote on Instagram.
The report added that the process for the issuance of visa had been initiated by CA in early January, and that Khawaja was the only member in the touring party whose application was not processed in time.

The report quoted a spokesperson of the Indian High Commission as saying that the matter was being investigated.
The Pakistan-born batter has played 56 Tests, 40 ODIs and nine T20Is for Australia. The 36-year-old also featured in the Indian Premier League back in 2016.
He was named Australia’s Test Player of the Year on Monday, an award named after the legendary Shane Warne.

Saudi football influence grows by winning seat on FIFA Council,The election win at the Asian Football Confederation’s annual meeting followed Cristiano Ronaldo arrival last month to play in the Saudi league and longstanding speculation about a likely bid to host the World Cup in 2030 or 2034.,"Saudi Arabia added to its influence in world soccer on Wednesday, winning a seat on the FIFA Council and then being confirmed as host of the 2027 Asian Cup.
The election win at the Asian Football Confederation’s annual meeting followed Cristiano Ronaldo arrival last month to play in the Saudi league and longstanding speculation about a likely bid to host the World Cup in 2030 or 2034.
Saudi soccer federation president Yasser Almisehal was among six Asian soccer officials elected by AFC members to represent them on FIFA’s decision-making committee through 2027. Saudi Arabia was the only candidate to host the Asian championship.
Qatari soccer federation president Sheikh Hamad Al Thani, whose country hosts the next Asian Cup in January 2024, also was elected to the FIFA Council. Sheikh Hamad earned 40 votes from the 45 federations, while Almisehal got 35.
The 37-member FIFA Council is chaired by Gianni Infantino, the governing body’s president who attended the election meeting in Bahrain.
The election results confirmed Saudi Arabia and Qatar at the heart of Asian soccer politics with the AFC presidency scheduled to be vacant in 2027.
AFC president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain was reelected by acclamation Wednesday to a final four-year term in a job he has held since 2013. He is also formally No. 2 to Infantino as the most senior of FIFA’s eight vice presidents.

FIFA Council positions — which pay a $250,000 salary in Zurich — were also won by Kohzo Tashima of Japan and Mariano Araneta of the Philippines, who retained their seats, and newcomer Hamidin Bin Mohd Amin, the Malaysian soccer federation leader.
Losing candidates were Du Zhaocai of China and Chung Mong-Gyu of South Korea, a scion of the family that owns Hyundai and who lost his seat in 2019.
The election for a FIFA Council seat protected for a woman was won by Kanya Keomany of Laos.
Later in the meeting, the Saudi bid to host the 2027 Asian Cup was confirmed unopposed. India withdrew its bid in December.
ADVERTISEMENT
Presenting the bid on stage, Saudi sports minister Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal called the 2027 tournament “a transformational moment in our collective football story.”
Saudi Arabia is a three-time champion of the Asian Cup, in 1984, 1988 and 1996, but has never hosted the tournament.
The kingdom raised its soccer profile when Ronaldo signed a 2 1/2-year deal with Al Nassr, and has been speculatively linked with a three-continent co-hosting bid to host the 2030 World Cup with Egypt from Africa and Greece from Europe.
That would require sending the tournament back to Asia and the Arabian Gulf only eight years after Qatar hosted the 2022 edition. A 2034 bid could be more realistic.

FIFA is expected to let more than 200 member federations choose the 2030 host next year.

"Tom Brady retires, insisting this time it’s for good","“Good morning guys. I'll get to the point right away,"" Brady says as the message begins. “I'm retiring. For good.""","Tom Brady, who won a record seven Super Bowls for New England and Tampa, has announced his retirement.
Brady — the most successful quarterback in NFL history, and one of the greatest athletes in team sports — posted the announcement on social media Wednesday morning, a brief video lasting just under one minute.
“Good morning guys. I’ll get to the point right away,” Brady says as the message begins. “I’m retiring. For good.”
He briefly retired after the 2021 season, but wound up coming back for one more year with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retires at age 45, the owner of numerous passing records in an unprecedented 23-year career.
Truly grateful on this day. Thank you 🙏🏻❤️ pic.twitter.com/j2s2sezvSS
— Tom Brady (@TomBrady) February 1, 2023
A year ago when he retired, it was in the form of a long Instagram post. But about six weeks later, he decided to come back for one more run. The Buccaneers — with whom he won a Super Bowl two seasons ago — made the playoffs again this season, losing in their playoff opener. And at the time, it begged the question about whether Brady would play again.
Only a couple weeks later, he has given the answer.
“I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first,” Brady says in the video. “I won’t be long-winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year.
“I really thank you guys so much, to every single one of you for supporting me. My family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There’s too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn’t change a thing. Love you all.”

Brady is the NFL’s career leader in yards passing (89,214) and touchdowns (649). He’s the only player to win more than five Super Bowls and has been MVP of the game five times.
Famously underrated coming into the NFL — he was picked 199th in the 2000 draft by the Patriots, behind six other quarterbacks, three kickers and a punter — Brady certainly wasn’t expected to become synonymous with greatness. He played in one game as a rookie, completing one of three passes for six yards.
The next year, it all changed.
Brady took over as the Patriots’ starter, the team beat the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl that capped the 2001 season, and he and New England coach Bill Belichick were well on their way to becoming the most successful coach-QB duo in football history.
More Super Bowl wins came after the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The Patriots returned to football’s mountaintop for a fourth time in Brady’s era a decade later to cap the 2014 season, the start of three more titles in a span of five years.
ADVERTISEMENT
In 2020, he joined the Buccaneers and won his seventh Super Bowl. He spent his last three years with Tampa Bay, getting them to the playoffs in each of those seasons.
“I think I’ve been on the record dozens of times saying there’s no quarterback I’d rather have than Tom Brady, and I still feel that way,” Belichick said in 2021 — shortly before Tampa Bay, with Brady, came to New England and beat the Patriots in a game dubbed “The Return.” “I was very lucky to have Tom as the quarterback, to coach him, and he was as good as any coach could ever ask for.”
Brady has won three NFL MVP awards, been a first-team All-Pro three times and selected to the Pro Bowl 15 times.
Brady and supermodel Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce this past fall, during the Bucs’ season. It ended a 13-year marriage between two superstars who respectively reached the pinnacles of football and fashion.

It was announced last year that when Brady retires from playing, he would join Fox Sports as a television analyst in a 10-year, $375 million deal.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/tom-brady-retires-insisting-this-time-its-for-good-8418441/,sports

Never considered coaching Pakistan team because of hate and abuse: Wasim Akram,"""I can accept criticism if the team is not doing well. But in Pakistan cricket, it is intolerable the way the captain and coaches are not only criticised but also abused by everyone,"" Akram said in an interview.","Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has said he has never considered coaching the national team because of the criticism, abuse and hate that are directed at coaches and captains in the country.
“I can accept criticism if the team is not doing well. But in Pakistan cricket, it is intolerable the way the captain and coaches are not only criticised but also abused by everyone,” Akram said in an interview.
“The abuse and at times hate which the captain and coach have to bear, I don’t think I am up to it. I don’t have that tolerance level, especially when it comes to the use of social media. They are some people who I think only sit on twitter day and night to send out negative comments.” Akram added he didn’t want the extra baggage of stress that comes with coaching the national side.
“League cricket is different, the pressure and expectation levels are different, which is why I am involved with the Karachi Kings side in the PSL.” The pace-bowling legend said that as coach of the Karachi side, some players routinely approach him and discuss cricket and he is always there to help and guide them.
“I am always willing to be of service to Pakistan cricket but not at the cost of having to bear unnecessary criticism and abuse from anyone out there.” Akram also advised Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to refrain from removing Babar Azam as captain in any format of the game.
“I think it will be a mistake. Because even if you change him as captain in any format it is not going to make any difference. What are the options. (It’s) best if he is supported by all of us, including the board. He is young and he will get better as captain. My thinking is that no one is born a natural captain and leader, these things come with time and experience.” Akram added he had always supported Babar as captain because he had a lot of cricket ahead of him and also because he was an automatic selection in the team.
“As a nation, I think for once we need to be positive and back Babar. Let’s do it and see what happens. I am confident he will become a good captain.” Akram said he was embarrassed at the way pressure had been built around Babar in recent days. “People in other countries laugh at our cricket culture. We need to start being more positive. Win and loss is part of the game.” He pointed out that Babar had led the team to the T20 Asia Cup final and the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia, which is a big achievement for any captain.

Akram also refused to dwell on Ramiz Raja’s performance when he was the PCB chairman.
“I don’t want to talk about him. There is a misconception that only a former cricketer should head the board… I don’t buy that because this is a job which requires a lot of administrative skills and the ability to have good communication with other boards etc,” said Akram.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/never-considered-coaching-pakistan-team-because-of-hate-and-abuse-wasim-akram-8418400/,sports
Deepti sets very high standards in training: Kanitkar,"With eight wickets in her kitty at an average of 8.75, the off-spinner has played a key role in India making the final of the women's T20 International Tri-Series here.","The secret of premier India all-rounder Deepti Sharma’s success is her high intensity training which is very close to match situations, batting coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar said on Wednesday.
With eight wickets in her kitty at an average of 8.75, the off-spinner has played a key role in India making the final of the women’s T20 International Tri-Series here.
“As long as the players keep training levels very high, it will keep working in matches. She (Deepti) practices very close to how she plays in matches, that really helps her,” Kanitkar said in a virtual media interaction on the eve of the final match against South Africa.
Deepti returned with splendid bowling figures of 3/11 to bowl India to an eight-wicket victory in their match against the West Indies on Monday.
“She’s an important player in any format we play. The good thing is that she has a method to get the runs, that makes her consistent. She’s doing well. She just needs to keep it simple, make sure the basics are right.” Veteran medium pacer Shikha Pandey, who made a return to India for the first time since October 2021, is yet to pick up a wicket in the series.
“Honestly it does not bother us much. She (Shikha) is working hard, got the attitude, got the experience, and we are fine with it,” Kanitkar said.
“I am happy with the way she’s bowling. Troy (bowling coach Troy Cooley) is working with her and he’s also happy with the way she’s bowling.” India opener Jemimah Rodrigues, who had a string of poor scores, also returned to form with an unbeaten 42 and Kanitkar said all the bases for the team were covered.

“There is a bit of everything. When a player is not happy with her performance, results not coming, we see what’s causing it. It’s a mixture of many things. We are covering all the bases.” The former India all-rounder also hailed captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s leadership qualities.
“She is just getting better, she’s always very committed, intense about what she wants from the team. That has continued.

The Serbian, who suffered the hamstring injury en route to winning the warm-up title in Adelaide, won the season-opening major after beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday’s final for a men’s record 22nd Grand Slam title, matching Rafa Nadal’s haul.
“This guy I did see, he had a three-centimetre tear in his hammy,” Tiley told SEN Sportsday.
“Absolutely (I saw the scans), the doctors are going to tell you the truth.
“There was a lot of speculation about whether it was true or not, it’s hard to believe that they can do what they do with those kinds of injuries.
“He’s remarkable, to deal with it extremely professionally.”
Djokovic’s coach Goran Ivanisevic said after the final that the world number one battled the injury, which would have forced most players to quit.
“He’s so focused on everything he does, with every single minute of the day,” Tiley added. “That’s what he eats, what he drinks, when he does it, how he does it.

Benfica’s statement said Chelsea would pay the contract release fee for the 22-year-old, who has signed an eight-and-a-half year deal with the London club. It takes Chelsea’s transfer spending in January alone to more than 300 million pounds.
According to media reports, Chelsea will pay the fee in several instalments.
“Sport Lisboa e Benfica – Futebol, SAD informs that it has reached an agreement with Chelsea FC for the sale of all the rights of the player Enzo Fernandez, for an amount of 121,000,000 euros,” a Benfica statement read.
Benfica signed Fernandez in July 2022 from River Plate, who have a 25% sell-on clause. He bagged four goals and seven assists in 29 games in all competitions for Benfica this season.
The 106.8 million pounds fee eclipses the 100 million pounds Manchester City paid Aston Villa for England midfielder Jack Grealish in 2021.

Fernandez was instrumental in Argentina’s World Cup-winning campaign in Qatar, breaking into the starting lineup and playing every game, scoring one of the goals in a vital victory over Mexico in the group phase.
He capped off the tournament by bagging the Young Player Award.
Benfica boss Roger Schmidt was not keen on seeing Fernandez leave but had said their hands would be tied if a club paid the player’s release clause.
Fernandez is Chelsea’s eighth recruit in the mid-season transfer window after the London club signed Mykhailo Mudryk, Benoit Badiashile, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos, David Fofana and Malo Gusto while Joao Felix arrived on loan from Atletico Madrid. All of them are 23 or younger.

On Tuesday, Chelsea sold experienced midfielder Jorginho to Premier League leaders Arsenal for 12 million pounds. However, Paris St Germain’s attempt to sign Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech on loan failed.
Fernandez’s transfer takes Chelsea’s total outlay on players since last May’s takeover by an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital to around 600 million pounds as they try to rebuild their squad.

Suryakumar reached the rating of 910 points after he stroked a quick-fire innings of 47 during the first match of India’s ongoing series against New Zealand in Ranchi as the exciting right-hander maintained his healthy lead at the top of the T20I rankings for batters.
While Suryakumar played a more composed knock of 26 not out in the second match of the series, the 32-year-old dropped back to a total of 908 rating points as a result.

Malan achieved a rating of 915 points in Cape Town back in 2020, but Suryakumar now holds the second highest rating of all time for T20I batters following his recent heroics with the willow.
He claimed the top ranking for current batters while scoring a total of 239 runs from six matches at last year’s T20 World Cup and only last month was deservedly named the ICC T20 Cricketer of the Year.

Sports ministry gets Rs 700cr-plus boost in Union Budget,"The amount is more than the revised budget of the previous financial year (2022-23) when the ministry received Rs 2,673.35 crore, as against the actual allocation of Rs 3,062.60 crore.","In a year when the Indian athletes will compete at the Asian Games and prepare for 2024 Paris Olympics, the Sports Ministry has got a fillip with the government allocating Rs 3,397.32 crore, an increase of Rs 723.97 crore, in the Union Budget here on Wednesday.
The amount is more than the revised budget of the previous financial year (2022-23) when the ministry received Rs 2,673.35 crore, as against the actual allocation of Rs 3,062.60 crore.
One of the reasons for the reduced revised allocation for 2022-23 could be the postponement of the Hangzhou Asian Games, which will be held this year.
The ministry’s flagship programme, ‘Khelo India — National Programme for Development of Sports’ continues to be the government’s priority, with it being allotted Rs 1,045 crore as against the revised allocation of Rs 606 crore during the previous financial year.
This is an increase of Rs 439 crore and points to the government’s commitment to the programme, which over the years, has shown the potential to produce athletes for major global events such as the Olympics, Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games.
The Sports Authority of India (SAI), which takes care of organising national camps for athletes, providing infrastructure and equipment to athletes, appointment of coaches and maintaining sports infrastructure, among others, has seen a Rs 36.09 crore increase in its budgetary allocation from the previous year’s revised expenditure of Rs 749.43 crore. Their allocation for 2023-24 stands at Rs 785.52 crore.
The National Sports Federations (NSFs) have received an increased allocation of Rs 45 crore, from previous year’s revised budget of Rs 280 crore and will now get Rs 325 crore.

A provision has been made in this year’s budget to provide NADA a funding of Rs 21.73 crore, while NDTL, which conducts the tests, will receive Rs 19.50 crore.
With countries across the world striving for sporting excellence and paying more attention to sports science and scientific training of athletes, this year’s budget has also made a provision of Rs 13 crore for National Centre of Sports Science and Research.

“Sometimes in life you have to make quick and important decisions,” Sabitzer said.
“From the moment I heard about this opportunity I knew it was right for me. I am a competitive player; I want to win and help the club achieve its aims this season.”

Barcelona show off Gavi’s new No. 6 shirt
Barcelona could not afford to sign new players but was able to register the ones it already had.

“We would have been happy to see Isco among us, but we have our limits. These were exceeded today, contrary to the previous agreement, so the transfer is not taking place,” Union general manager Oliver Ruhnert said.

The London team might not be finished.
The final day of the window was another busy one for Chelsea and its new American ownership, with the club negotiating with Benfica in the hope of signing Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez for a British-record fee of 105 million pounds ($130 million) after selling Jorginho to Premier League leader Arsenal. Hakim Ziyech could also leave Chelsea to join Paris Saint-Germain on loan.
Seven players have already arrived at Stamford Bridge this month, including Ukraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk in a deal worth around $108 million and France center back Benoît Badiashile for $40 million.

If Fernandez joins, that would take Chelsea’s spending up to around $350 million in January.
This comes after Chelsea spent around $280 million in Europe’s summer transfer window, the first under the new ownership fronted by Todd Boehly following the purchase of the club for $2.5 billion in May.
Chelsea has handed new players long contracts — as much as 8 1/2 years for Mudryk, for example — to allow the club to spread the cost of the signings over the length of the deal and comply with financial fair-play regulations.
Fernandez would be the most expensive signing of the lot, with the fee for the 22-year-old World Cup winner surpassing the 100 million pounds (then $139 million) Manchester City paid Aston Villa for Jack Grealish in 2021.

JORGINHO TO ARSENAL
Italy international Jorginho has cost Arsenal a reported 12 million pounds ($14.75 million) in a move that gives the league leaders an extra option in midfield in their bid to win a first top-flight title since 2004.
Arsenal made a late move in the transfer window to strengthen its central-midfield department, with Mohamed Elneny — a backup to first-choice holding midfielder Thomas Partey — ruled out for a lengthy period Tuesday because of injury.
Attempts to sign Ecuador international Moises Caideco from Brighton were rebuffed last week, leading Arsenal to turn to Jorginho, who helped Italy win the European Championship in 2021.
💬 “Jorginho is a midfield player with intelligence, deep leadership skills and a huge amount of Premier League and International experience. He has won in his career, but he still has the hunger and huge willingness to contribute here.”

CANCELO LEAVES CITY
Manchester City sent Joao Cancelo on loan to Bayern Munich for the rest of the season, with the Portugal fullback having fallen out of favor with manager Pep Guardiola since the World Cup.
The German champions have the option to make the transfer permanent for a fee of 70 million euros ($76 million).
Cancelo was one of City’s key players last season but Guardiola feels the team can do without the attacking, versatile defender after a recent tactical switch and the emergence of 18-year-old right back Rico Lewis.

Tottenham manager Antonio Conte places a lot of importance in his wing backs and the club switched around the players on the right side on deadline day.
Spain wing back Pedro Porro joined from Sporting in Portugal on loan, with Tottenham obliged to buy him for a reported 39 million pounds ($48 million) at the end of the season. To make room in the squad, Tottenham sent Djed Spence on loan to Rennes in France and mutually agreed to the termination of Matt Doherty’s contract to enable him to join Atletico Madrid in Spain.

Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth were busy bolstering their squads for their bids to avoid relegation from the Premier League.
Forest brought in three players — the signature signing being Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas on loan from Paris Saint-Germain for the rest of the season. Felipe, a 33-year-old Brazilian central defender, arrived from Atletico and midfielder Jonjo Shelvey came from Newcastle.

Andhra special: Ricky Bhui’s best Ranji year continues as he slams a ton against Madhya Pradesh,"Former U-19 team-mate of Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson, Bhui has emerged from the shadows this Ranji season to power Andhra’s campaign as wicketkeeper batsman.","Ever since Ricky Bhui walked into the Andhra team as a 17-year-old, he has had to deal with expectations. Coming from a state where only three players have donned the national colours so far, Bhui was touted as an India material from the outset. A century on his List A debut in the Vijay Hazare Trophy added to his growing status in Andhra. And almost 10 years since his debut, Bhui is at a stage of his career where he is still waiting for that one break-through season.
After blowing hot and cold over the last few seasons, the 26-year old Bhui seems to be getting there. On Tuesday, his unbeaten 115 runs powered Andhra to a strong position against Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals at the Holkar Stadium in Indore. Asked to bat first, he walked in with Andhra on at 58/2 and three overs later as Hanuma Vihari retired hurt effectively leaving them three down, the onus was on Bhui to deliver. And in the company of Karan Shinde, Bhui thwarted Madhya Pradesh’s hopes of shutting Andhra to a low total as they ended Day 1 at 262/2.

Bengal pacers make merry as Jharkhand dismissed for 173,"More than half of Jharkhand's score was made by their No 3 batter Kumar Suraj, who looked composed and elegant en route to a gritty 89 not out.","Pacer Akash Deep led Bengal’s impressive show with a four-wicket haul as Jharkhand failed to last three full sessions and folded for a paltry 173 in their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal at Eden Gardens here on Tuesday. The Bengal pace trio of Akash Deep, Mukesh Kumar (3/61) and Ishan Porel (1/26) claimed seven wickets between them to revel in bowling-friendly conditions after the home team skipper Manoj Tiwary won a good toss.
More than half of Jharkhand’s score was made by their No 3 batter Kumar Suraj, who looked composed and elegant en route to a gritty 89 not out.
The lefthander struck some elegant cover drives, scored on both sides of the wickets using his wrists beautifully but only to be stranded 11 runs shy of a third first-class hundred.
Suraj batted deep into his crease to negate the pace threat by the Bengal pacers and carried his bat through but wickets kept on falling at the other end.
Jharkhand No 11 batter Ashish Kumar (12 off 8 balls) was one of the four Jharkhand batters to get to a double digit as he lent fine support to brighten Suraj’s century prospects.
But Ashish fell after a mix-up as Bengal ended their innings in 66.2 overs. The duo put together 20 runs for the last wicket.
Bad light meant that Bengal could not come out to bat in the first innings as day one ended with 21 overs in arrears.

Opting to bowl, Bengal got a perfect start with Akash Deep cleaning up Kumar Deobrat with an incoming delivery.
He bowled with brisk speed and accurate line, making it difficult for Jharkhand who lost half of their side for 77 runs.
Akash Deep got his fourth victim with a yorker that trapped Shahbaz Nadeem plumb in front. Mukesh Kumar at the other end bagged his third victim in Rahul Shukla (0).

Batting at number nine, bowler Parth Bhut shone with the bat and saved Saurashtra the blushes with a gritty century on the first day of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal against Punjab here.
Bhut was yet to open his account when Saurashtra lost their eighth wicket for 147 at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium.
However, thanks to the 25-year-old left-arm spinner’s unbeaten knock of 111 and his last-wicket partnership of 95 runs with Yuvrajsinh Dodiya (17), the hosts could stretch their total to 303 before getting bowled out with three overs still remaining in the day.
In reply, Punjab faced just one over and were three for no loss when the stumps were called on Tuesday.
Prabhsimran Singh (2) and Naman Dhir (1) were at the crease.

In all, Bhut struck 11 boundaries and four sixes while scoring his runs at a fairly decent strike-rate of 71.61.

Medium-pacer M Venkatesh sizzled with a five-wicket haul as Karnataka produced a sensational bowling effort to bundle out Uttarakhand for a paltry 116 on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal here on Tuesday.
Karnataka were 123 for no loss at stumps.
The 22-year-old Venkatesh justified captain Mayank Agarwal’s decision to field after winning the toss as he rocked the top-order, removing Avneesh Sudha (17) and Dikshanshu Negi (9) early after Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/17) drew the first blood, dismissing opener Jiwanjot Singh (1).

Vijaykumar Vyshak (1/25) then had Swapnil Singh (0) caught by Samarth R, while Kaverappa cleaned up Aditya Tare (14), as Uttarakhand lost half their side for only 64 in 27.4 overs.
Kunal Chandela (31) tried to hold one end but wickets continued to tumble, with Venkatesh returning to strike twice in the 47th over, sending Akhil Rawat (14) and Abhay Negi (1) back to the dressing room.
The Mysore pacer also had Chandela caught by Manish Pandey to put the final nail in Uttarakhand’s coffins as spinner K Gowtham mopped up the tail with two wickets.
In reply, Karnataka seemed to be batting on a different track as both the openers — Ravikumar Samarth (54) and Mayank Agarwal (65) — looked in full flow during their unbeaten fifties.

Boxer Klitschko joins fight against Olympic path for Russia,The former heavyweight champion suggested in a video message published Monday that sports leaders will be accomplices to the war if athletes from Russia and its military ally Belarus can compete at the next Olympics.,"Olympic gold medalist Wladimir Klitschko has joined Ukraine’s fight against IOC plans to let some Russians compete at the 2024 Paris Summer Games.
The former heavyweight champion suggested in a video message published Monday that sports leaders will be accomplices to the war if athletes from Russia and its military ally Belarus can compete at the next Olympics.
The International Olympic Committee set out its preferred path last week for Russians and Belarusians who have not openly supported the war to qualify for Paris and compete in 18 months’ time as neutral athletes with no flag or anthem. Qualifying events would likely be in Asia.
That softening of the IOC advice given last February — that sports bodies should exclude Russia and Belarus from international events — provoked anger in Ukraine, which warned it could boycott Paris.
Klitschko’s one-minute statement filmed beside bomb-damaged buildings started “Dear Thomas Bach” in a direct challenge to the IOC president.
“The world is watching you, history will judge you. Good luck with your decision,” Klitschko said in the latest riposte from Ukraine trying to tie Bach closely to Olympic policy for Russia.
Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskyy directly invited Bach last week to visit Bakhmut, a wrecked city on the war’s current frontline, and his adviser Mykhaïlo Podolyak ended a stinging criticism of the IOC on Twitter with the words “Right, Mr. Bach?”
ADVERTISEMENT
“You are the representative of the universal values of tolerance and peace,” Klitschko said on camera to Bach, who also won Olympic gold, in team fencing. “I tell you; the Russians are Olympic champions in crimes against civilians.”
“You cannot put your Olympic emblem on these crimes because you will be an accomplice with this abominable war,” said Klitschko, who won the superheavyweight title at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
Klitschko’s elder brother, Vitali, is the mayor of Kviv and also a former heavyweight champion. They trained and fought for much of their professional careers in Germany, Bach’s home country.
Responding to criticism on Monday, the IOC said it “rejects in the strongest possible terms this and other defamatory statements.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“They cannot serve as a basis for any constructive discussion,” said the Olympic body, which has cited a “unifying mission” to have all 206 national teams compete together peacefully.
The IOC also has pointed to human rights concerns at the United Nations that athletes must not face discrimination based solely on their passport.
The updated guidance must be weighed by governing bodies overseeing most of the 32 sports on the Paris program. Russian teams already cannot qualify for the Olympic soccer tournaments due to an international ban by FIFA, which cited security concerns and the probability some opponents would refuse to play.
While key Olympic sports like track and field and swimming excluded Russians and Belarusians soon after the war started, tennis and cycling have allowed the athletes to compete as neutrals.
ADVERTISEMENT
Leaders of the umbrella group of Summer Games governing bodies will meet March 3 for talks on the Russian issues presented to them by the IOC.
The group, known by the acronym ASOIF, noted their members independence late Monday, stating “the importance of respecting the specificity of each federation and their particular qualification process” for the Paris Olympics.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/boxer-klitschko-joins-fight-against-olympic-path-for-russia-8416101/,sports

Australia’s Warner fears for future of Test cricket,"Warner, who has played 101 tests and more than 200 limited overs internationals, said he had tried to impress upon younger team mates, including Sydney Thunder talent Oliver Davies, the importance of the longest format.","Australia opener David Warner has expressed concern for the future of test cricket, with emerging players focusing on “short term” interests as lucrative T20 leagues proliferate globally.
Warner, who has played 101 tests and more than 200 limited overs internationals, said he had tried to impress upon younger team mates, including Sydney Thunder talent Oliver Davies, the importance of the longest format.
“I was speaking to (Davies) the other day. He likes playing white-ball cricket, I can’t see him playing red-ball cricket any time soon,” Warner told reporters.
“If he wants to put his mind to it, he can definitely play.
“But I’ve got a little bit of scaredness about what’s going to happen in the next five to 10 years, where cricket is actually heading.
“I’d love for guys coming through to play red-ball cricket and play test cricket because that’s the legacy that you should want to leave behind.”
A number of top Australian cricketers have carved out lucrative careers on the global T20 circuit without playing tests, including Tim David, Chris Lynn and Marcus Stoinis.

Warner suggested they were the exception and that most players would be better off boosting their value in test cricket.
“There’s only been a small minority of people who have been able to do that and have a long career (without tests),” said the 36-year-old.
“Guys see the short term at the moment with all the leagues and stuff around.

“I’m extremely excited to welcome Ajinkya to Leicestershire. He comes with a lot of experience and a tremendous work ethic. It’s a great opportunity for us to tap into that,” Director of Cricket, Claude Henderson said.
“I had conversations with (Assistant Coach) Alfonso Thomas and (Head Coach) Paul Nixon, who had eyed Ajinkya in the past, so he was always on our radar.

There is still enough pull to play for New Zealand: Ferguson on players giving up contracts,"Three New Zealand players -- Trent Boult, Martin Guptill and Jimmy Neesham -- gave up their central contracts last year to play in different T20 leagues across the world.","New Zealand pacer Lockie Ferguson empathised with his fellow players giving up central contracts for lucrative T20 league deals but said there is still enough “pull” to represent the country in big-ticket events, such as the World Cup.
Three New Zealand players — Trent Boult, Martin Guptill and Jimmy Neesham — gave up their central contracts last year to play in different T20 leagues across the world.
Asked if it would affect the future of T20 cricket in New Zealand, Ferguson said: “I don’t think I have the answer. And it’s certainly above my pay grade but, from our point of view, you can understand players when they’re at the sort of back end of their careers.
“But at the same time, I know they will still want to play for New Zealand. So finding the balance, I’m not sure what that might be. Certainly, as I said, people above the chain to me, will work that out. But I think, from a player’s point of view, we love playing for the Black Caps.” “Certainly since I’ve been playing such a rich history of being very successful, and that’s enjoyable to play and seeing the young talent come through and do well as well is very rewarding.
“So, I think, from a player’s point of view, we want to play for New Zealand in World Cups. That’s sort of what kids dream of, and I think there’s still a lot of pull for that.” The 31-year-old, who played under Hardik Pandya as part of Gujarat Titans side in IPL last year, heaped praise on the India T20 skipper.
“Hardik, I have a very high regard certainly from day one, playing underneath him in Gujarat (Titans), he is a clear leader within the group and demands the audience very quickly.
“But, at the same time, I guess, similar to Kane (Williamson) he has time for everyone in the group,” Ferguson said.

“He’s done well with India. You can see his body language has been fantastic with the group and I think, he is an exceptional leader for the country. But certainly, I enjoyed my time playing under him.” New Zealand suffered a 3-0 loss against India in the ODI series and are currently tied 1-1 in the three-match T20 rubber after losing the second game in Lucknow by six wickets.
“Look, the one-day series was challenging, certainly the first ODI we had our chance to win it. And then, outplayed in the second one, and in the third one, we were sort of lined out well too. So although on paper it’s 3-0, I thought it was a pretty competitive series,” he said.
“And then, in the T20s, it’s been pretty even throughout. So always nice to come to a decider, particularly in a lovely stadium like this.” The pitches used for the two T20 games favoured the spinners a lot with India skipper Pandya criticising the Lucknow track, which saw New Zealand post just 99 in 20 overs.
Ferguson, however, said low-scoring games are good for cricket since T20 is mostly dominated by batters.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I bowled my four (overs) in the first game and I actually enjoyed bowling the cross seamers, sort of sped a little bit, got a bit of an extra pace and carry. To be honest, even Arshdeep bowling to me in the last game, there was a little bit of pace and carry, but clearly spin was the right option.
“We play a lot of T20s here in India, and around the world and we have those high-scoring games. And as a bowler, I think sometimes those sort of lower scores, probably not the 100, but lower score games actually are just as exciting and brings a good battle between bat and ball.
“So I think for the game, it’s great. Certainly I’m sure fans prefer the big, high- scoring matches but, as a cricket player, that can be pretty exciting.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/there-is-still-enough-pull-to-play-for-new-zealand-ferguson-on-players-giving-up-contracts-8415944/,sports
We had to adapt to whatever we got and just move on with the situation: Suryakumar Yadav on the Lucknow pitch,"The Lucknow pitch has been in the eye of the storm after India trudged over the line to chase 100 runs with one ball to spare, to level the T20 series 1-1 against New Zealand on Sunday which led to the pitch curator at Ekana Stadium getting the sack.","Swashbuckling Indian batter Suryakumar Yadav on Tuesday while talking about the Lucknow pitch said that if both teams are trying to have a good competition, the wicket shouldn’t matter a lot.

Apology issued after Chelsea player Mudryk’s racist video,"The forward, who joined Chelsea from Shakhtar Donetsk this month in a deal worth $108 million, was reciting the lyrics to a song on TikTok in a post from last year.","An apology has been issued on behalf of Chelsea player Mykhailo Mudryk after he appeared to use the N-word in a video posted on social media.
The forward, who joined Chelsea from Shakhtar Donetsk this month in a deal worth $108 million, was reciting the lyrics to a song on TikTok in a post from last year.
He has now deleted the video.
“Mykhailo is deeply sorry for any offense caused by the video posted on his TikTok account last July,” his representative reportedly told the Sun newspaper in Britain. “Whilst his intention was solely to recite lyrics of a song, Mykhailo regrets his decision and wholeheartedly accepts it was not appropriate. The video has since been removed.”
Chelsea has not responded to a request for comment
Anti-racism group Kick it Out said it condemned the use of the N-word irrespective of context.
“The N-word is deeply offensive and the use of this term by high-profile figures in football can only serve to alienate people from the game. It is important that footballers use their significant platform in a positive way, and we’re encouraged to see that Mykhailo Mudryk has acknowledged the hurt caused by his use of this offensive slur,” it said.

Police chiefs apologise for Hillsborough failures after 34 years,"""Policing has profoundly failed those bereaved by the Hillsborough disaster over many years and we are sorry that the service got it so wrong,"" Chief Constable Andy Marsh, CEO of the College of Policing, said in a statement.","Britain’s National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and College of Policing have apologised to survivors and the families of the victims of the 1989 Hillsborough soccer stadium disaster in which 97 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush.
The 1989 FA Cup semi-final was the scene of Britain’s worst sporting disaster when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death in an over-crowded and fenced-in enclosure in the lower tier.
One victim died in July 2021 after suffering severe and irreversible brain damage.
Police at first blamed the disaster on drunken fans, an explanation that was always rejected by survivors, relatives of the victims and the wider Liverpool community who spent years fighting to find out what had happened.

Later inquests and an independent inquiry absolved the fans of any responsibility.
“Policing has profoundly failed those bereaved by the Hillsborough disaster over many years and we are sorry that the service got it so wrong,” Chief Constable Andy Marsh, CEO of the College of Policing, said in a statement.
“Police failures were the main cause of the tragedy and have continued to blight the lives of family members ever since.
“When leadership was most needed, the bereaved were often treated insensitively and the response lacked coordination and oversight.”

Martin Hewitt, the NPCC Chair, said he was “deeply sorry for the tragic loss of life” and for the “pain and suffering that the families of the 97 victims experienced on that day” and in the years that followed.
“Collectively, the changes made since the Hillsborough disaster and in response to Rt Reverend James Jones’s report aim to ensure the terrible police failures made on the day and in the aftermath can never happen again,” he added.
In 2019, former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, the police commander in charge of operations at the stadium, was found not guilty of manslaughter – a decision that had shocked the survivors and family members of the victims.
Earlier this month, Newcastle United fans complained of “overcrowding and crushing” and a lack of stewarding at the Hillsborough Stadium during their FA Cup match against Sheffield Wednesday at the same Leppings Lane End.

ATP finds ‘insufficient evidence’ on abuse allegations against Zverev,"In October 2021, the ATP had launched an investigation into allegations levelled by his ex-girlfriend Olga Sharypova, who said in a magazine interview that Zverev was emotionally and physically abusive to her during their relationship.","The ATP will not take any action against former world number two Alexander Zverev following allegations of domestic abuse against the German, the men’s tennis governing body said on Tuesday.
In October 2021, the ATP had launched an investigation into allegations levelled by his ex-girlfriend Olga Sharypova, who said in a magazine interview that Zverev was emotionally and physically abusive to her during their relationship.
Zverev has consistently denied all the allegations.
The ATP said the investigation’s primary focus was related to alleged abuses taking place at the Masters event in Shanghai in 2019 but its scope also included alleged misconduct in Monaco, New York and Geneva based on reports.
“A major independent investigation into Alexander Zverev has found insufficient evidence to substantiate published allegations of abuse. As a result, no disciplinary action will be taken by ATP,” it said in a statement.
“The investigation was carried out by The Lake Forest Group (LFG), a third-party investigator.
“LFG conducted extensive interviews with both Sharypova and Zverev, and 24 other individuals including family and friends, tennis players, and other parties involved with the ATP Tour.”
After the 15-month investigation, which involved going through material on Zverev’s electronic devices, the ATP said they were unable to substantiate allegations of abuse or determine that any player offences took place.

“This determination may however be re-evaluated should new evidence come to light, or should any legal proceedings reveal violations of ATP rules,” it added.

Geopolitical challenges loom for WTA after Sabalenka’s Australian triumph,"After years of struggling with nerves on the biggest stage, 24-year-old Sabalenka's three-set win over Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the final at Melbourne Park gave the big-hitting Belarusian her first Grand Slam title.","Aryna Sabalenka’s long-awaited confirmation as a Grand Slam champion and a corker of an Australian Open final were a welcome balm for the WTA as the women’s tour seeks to move on from a bruising loss of star power.
Challenges lie ahead, however, as the circuit negotiates a tricky geopolitical landscape and a scheduling impasse with the lucrative Chinese market.
After years of struggling with nerves on the biggest stage, 24-year-old Sabalenka’s three-set win over Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the final at Melbourne Park gave the big-hitting Belarusian her first Grand Slam title.
Now world number two and boasting one of the most powerful games in women’s tennis, she looms as a major threat to top-ranked Pole Iga Swiatek, who she beat at the WTA Finals. The development of a proper rivalry between the pair would be a tonic for the WTA which has produced few of note in recent years and recently lost Serena Williams, a player that transcended the sport, to retirement.
Sabalenka’s hopes of shaking up the women’s game may be taken out of her hands at Wimbledon, however, if Russian and Belarusian players remain banned from the grasscourt Grand Slam.
Sabalenka, along with all Russian and Belarusian players, missed Wimbledon last year after organisers controversially excluded them as a consequence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a “special operation”. With the conflict in Ukraine showing no sign of ending, a decision about Russian and Belarusian players competing at the All England Club is pressing.
The ban had other consequences that are still being felt today, with players who competed at Wimbledon unable to earn ranking points from the tournament after it was sanctioned by both the WTA and the men’s ATP tour. The loss of points was a setback for some players, not least champion Rybakina, who would have had a much higher seeding than 22 at the Australian Open.
ADVERTISEMENT
The 23-year-old had to knock out Swiatek and two other Grand Slam champions in a tough draw at Melbourne Park to reach the final.
Her ranking has now jumped 15 places to 10th as a result of that run, which should help the Russia-born Kazakh’s bid for a second Grand Slam title to add to her Wimbledon trophy.
CHINA STAND-OFF
The Australian Open provided another reminder of the strength of Chinese women’s tennis as Zhang Shuai and Zhu Lin reached the last 16 of the women’s singles.
The Chinese men’s game, long overshadowed by the success of the country’s women, also showed promise as teenager Shang Juncheng became the first Chinese man to win a main draw match at the Australian Open in the professional era.
China’s abandonment of its zero-COVID policy is expected to pave the way for the return of international tennis after a three-year hiatus, and the ATP has three events in the country listed in its 2023 calendar.
ADVERTISEMENT
The WTA’s schedule remains blank after the U.S. Open, however, with no clarity on tournaments to be held in China pending a resolution to the Peng Shuai issue.
Former world number one doubles player Peng accused a senior Chinese government official of sexual assault in 2021 in a post on social media that was soon removed from the country’s internet.

IOC rejects ‘defamatory’ criticism from Ukraine,"Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak at the weekend described the Lausanne-based body as promoting ""violence, mass murders, destruction"" and said on Monday a Russian presence at the Games would constitute giving the country ""a platform to promote genocide"".","The International Olympic Committee on Monday rejected fierce criticism from Ukrainian officials, who have accused it of promoting war after the body said Russians could potentially be given the opportunity to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak at the weekend described the Lausanne-based body as promoting “violence, mass murders, destruction” and said on Monday a Russian presence at the Games would constitute giving the country “a platform to promote genocide”.
“The IOC rejects in the strongest possible terms this and other defamatory statements,” the IOC said in a statement. “They cannot serve as a basis for any constructive discussion.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who last week called for a campaign to keep Russian athletes from competing in Paris, asked Denmark’s visiting prime minister for support on Monday.
In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy pledged to “protect sports structures and the international Olympic movement from being discredited through the efforts of some representatives of sports bureaucracy to allow Russian athletes at international competitions”.
Russia invaded neighbour Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year saying it wanted to protect its security and Russian speakers. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions driven from their homes.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba drew attention earlier to the fact that many Russian Olympians had ties with the military, including by competing for sports clubs affiliated with the defence ministry.

“The army that commits atrocities, kills, rapes, and loots. This is whom the ignorant IOC wants to put under white flag allowing to compete,” Kuleba wrote on Twitter.
Russia has denied allegations that its forces have committed atrocities in Ukraine.
The IOC said last week that it welcomed a proposal from the Olympic Council of Asia for Russian and Belarusian athletes to have the chance to compete in Asia.
That could potentially also include Olympic qualifying events, given Russian and Belarusian athletes are unable to compete in Europe due to various restrictions and bans as well as opposition caused by Russia’s invasion.

Steve Smith on no warm-up games: ‘Last time we got served up a green-top (to practice on) and it was sort of irrelevant’,"Coach Andrew McDonald too had explained the rationale behind the decision: No tour game is something we’ve done in the last few series, before embarking on overseas tours.","The first competitive game Australia would play in India would be the first Test in Nagpur, as they snubbed the usual routine of playing warm-up games in the build-up to the four-Test series. Ace batsman Steve Smith explained the reason, before they flew to Bangalore, where they would be based for five days, on Monday evening. “The last time we went I’m pretty sure we got served up a green-top (to practice on) and it was sort of irrelevant. We’re better off having our own nets and getting spinners in and bowling as much as they can.We’ll wait and see when we hit the ground. I think we’ve made the right decision to not play a tour match,” he said.
Coach Andrew McDonald too had explained the rationale behind the decision: No tour game is something we’ve done in the last few series, before embarking on overseas tours. We feel as though we don’t need that match practice as such. We’re going to go to India about a week out from the first game. We didn’t want to press for too much longer, in terms of the preparation,” he told Sydney Morning Herald.
“We’ve done it before with the Pakistan build-up in Melbourne. Dusting up wickets. Working with the local groundsmen who really help us in and around the country.We feel as though we can get as close to that as possible without necessarily having a practice game,” he added.
There, though, has been widespread criticism from former Australian cricketers for not opting for warm-up games. None more scathing than former captain Michael Clarke. “That’s the part I don’t understand,” Clarke said. “The no tour game before the first Test in India. I hope I’m proven wrong but I think that is going to be significant. Batting in those conditions in one-day cricket and T20 cricket is one thing, batting in Indian conditions in Test cricket it is a completely different game,” he told Big Sports.
Their preparation for the tour included a condensed training camp in
North Sydney at the weekend, where curators were asked to prepare a pitch that might mimic a dry, cracked deck in India. “We feel as though seven days is ample time to get ready and to make sure we maintain freshness throughout the whole four Test match series.”
“Not a final frontier”
Smith, though, resisted from calling the tour the “final frontier.” “It’s certainly huge. I don’t know if it’s the final frontier. India and England – our two opponents over the next six months – are probably our biggest as an Australian Test cricketer. We’ve got some challenges in front of us, but the guys are ready for it. I’ve never won (in India), I’ve been there twice. In fact it’s been very difficult playing there.” he added.

In Smith’s previous tour to India, he racked up 499 runs at an average of 71 including three glorious hundreds. It followed a three-year purple patch before his form dipped narrowly, only to rediscover the touch in the last year. In his last 16 innings in all formats since, Smith has hammered 1027 runs at 85.58 with four centuries. “I’m starting to feel like I felt back then. It sounds strange because I’ve scored quite a few runs in the meantime,” Smith said.
“The optimum for me, I’ve got that back in terms of my grip, and where my feet are going, and how my weight is transferring. I feel in a really good place so hopefully the next six months is really big for me and the team,” he added.
He said he would relish batting on spinning tracks. “I really enjoy playing on those spinning tracks there, so much fun and there’s always something happening,” he said.

However, he emphasised that not all surfaces tend to be spinning tracks, as they would be hyped before the game. “But you know, if they’re not the spinning ones and they’re a bit flatter there, the ones where you can really cash in and you have to make big, big scores. I think that’s certainly one thing that I’ll be telling the boys when we get over there.

Authorities seek fans behind hate attack against Vinícius Júnior,"Vinícius was targeted by racist chants earlier this season. Spanish state prosecutors closed a probe into racist chants by Atletico fans before another derby, citing a lack of evidence and downplaying their seriousness because the chants allegedly came within the rivalry setting of a soccer match.","Authorities are searching through security cameras and social media to try to identify those responsible for hanging a dummy of Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior from a highway bridge last week.
Members of an anti-violence committee in sports met on Monday and said an investigation was underway to try to find those who hung the dummy and a banner with the words “Madrid hates Real” hours before Real Madrid played Atlético Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey on Thursday.
The message on the banner is often used by one of Atletico Madrid’s ultra fans groups, though at the time it denied being responsible for the display.
The hate attack drew widespread condemnation by the clubs and other soccer officials across Spain.
Vinícius scored in Madrid’s 3-1 win at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. He said on Twitter after the match that “there is only one Madrid, everyone knows it,” and “Vini loves Madrid.” The next day, the Brazil forward said “love will always beat hate.”
Vinícius was targeted by racist chants earlier this season. Spanish state prosecutors closed a probe into racist chants by Atletico fans before another derby, citing a lack of evidence and downplaying their seriousness because the chants allegedly came within the rivalry setting of a soccer match.
But the anti-violence committee said it was studying punishment to about a dozen Valladolid fans who also insulted Vinícius in a match in December. The committee said the punishment could include fines of 4,000 euros to each individual identified, as well as banning them in sports venues for one year.

Australian Open sets Grand Slam attendance record,"A record 839,192 fans flocked to Melbourne Park from Jan. 16-29 for the first tournament in two years free of COVID-19 restrictions, beating the previous mark of 812,174 set in January 2020.","The Australian Open set a Grand Slam attendance record with more than 900,000 spectators visiting over three weeks, organisers said on Tuesday, despite the absence of some big-name players and schedule disruptions due to rain.
A record 839,192 fans flocked to Melbourne Park from Jan. 16-29 for the first tournament in two years free of COVID-19 restrictions, beating the previous mark of 812,174 set in January 2020.
The figures eclipse last year’s attendance numbers at other Grand Slam main draws – 515,164 visited Wimbledon, 613,500 were at the French Open and 776,120 went to the U.S. Open.
Over 60,000 also watched the qualifying events in Melbourne, bringing the total up to 902,312.
The tournament, missing the retired Serena Williams, Roger Federer and last year’s homegrown champion Ash Barty, broke its single-day attendance mark with 94,854 fans visiting on Jan. 21. The previous record was 93,709 set in 2020.
“It was reported that we didn’t have the greats any more, that it was going to be terrible. But people just want to be entertained,” Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley told the Melbourne Age.
“They want to have some fun, and tennis is a great option for them, and it’s become a summer thing to do for Melburnians and for Australians and also for our guests from around the world.”

Tiley has set his sights on breaching the one million mark next year.
“This year was the start of it,” Tiley said. “It’s going to be a three-week extravaganza.

Don’t like home sides denying touring teams quality preparation: Ian Healy ahead of India tour,"Healy backed Khawaja's suggestion, saying it was a good idea to assemble the touring party spinners in Sydney ahead of the tour to acclimatise them to replica India pitches.","Legendary Australian wicket-keeper Ian Healy has taken a potshot at India, saying the idea behind Pat Cummins’ side not playing a tour game in the subcontinent ahead of the Test series is because “we no longer trust” the facilities provided by the host nation.
Australia will not play a single tour game ahead of the four-Test Border-Gavaskar series and a member of the squad, Usman Khawaja, had said recently that there was no point playing practice games as the wickets prepared for tour fixtures and actual matches in India were very different.
“Have you ever been pre-tour with us (Australia)? They can be spinning wickets when we play but we go to the practice matches and they are green Gabba-like wickets out there (in India), so what’s the point,” Khawaja had said during a press conference earlier this month.
Healy backed Khawaja’s suggestion, saying it was a good idea to assemble the touring party spinners in Sydney ahead of the tour to acclimatise them to replica India pitches.
“We’ve gathered our spinners in Sydney for strategic talks (on replica India surfaces)… we no longer trust that the requested facilities will be provided for a nation,” Healy said on SEN Radio on Monday.
“We’ve been part of this shenanigan too by the way… when we’re over (in England) we spend our time whinging about weakened County teams that England put up as our opposition before the series.” Healy said he doesn’t like the trend of home boards preparing different sets of wickets for tour games and actual matches, adding that it amounts to a breach of “trust”.
“Our focus in cricket has shifted from creating opportunities and experiences for our best up and coming cricketers… now we deny touring teams quality preparation before very highly anticipated series and I don’t like it.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s disappointing to watch such dismantling of trust between cricket’s nations and it needs to stop,” added Healy.
Australia begin their Test series against India at Nagpur on February 9 and Khawaja had said recently that it was a “good idea” not to play tour games, indicating they serve little purpose.
“I think we have finally learned. When I heard we weren’t going to have a practice game I went up to (head coach) Andrew McDonald and said, ‘Good idea’,” Khawaja had said recently.
Australia haven’t won a Test series in India since 2004/05 and are keen to turn around their fortunes in the subcontinent during the upcoming tour.

“Touring teams seem to all struggle these days and here we go again, we’re going to India without a whole lot of Indian practice under our belts, let alone England later in the year where we haven’t won since 2001,” Healy added.

Healy, however, said that a tour match midway through the Test series would be a good idea to give the touring party’s seven reserves some match practice.
“In India they’re (Australia) hoping everything will click and the squad freshens up with net practice… our coaching staff are content with this and I’ll trust them for now.

"Deadline-day drama: Chelsea could break EPL record for Fernandez, Arsenal pursuing £70m-Brighton man Caicedo, Cancelo bound for Bayern loan spell","The figure could soar on Tuesday, the deadline day, as several clubs are frantically negotiating with players’ agents before the shutters roll on the window.","This transfer window has seen English Premier League clubs breaking their bank and spending around £550m, breaking the 2018 record of £430m. The figure could soar on Tuesday, the deadline day, as several clubs are frantically negotiating with players’ agents before the shutters roll on the window.
None are likely to swell the net-spend figures as Chelsea. The London club, under the new owner Todd Boehly and revamping under Graham Potter, has already signed players in the region of £200m on seven new players—Benoit Badiashile (£35m), Andrey Santos (£18m), Joao Felix (loan with £9.7m fee), Noni Madueke (£30.7m) and Mykhailo Mudryk (£62m rising to £89m). They are now on the negotiation table with Benfica to sign Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez, for whom the Portuguese club is demanding an amount in the region of £105 to £115 million, which could be an EPL transfer record . Simultaneously, they are also eyeing Brighton’s Moisés Caicedo, who league toppers Arsenal have been hotly pursuing. The Gunners made an offer of around £70 million, but was rejected, and the cash-loaded Chelsea could cash in. Arsenal, though, could benefit from the Blues’ clear-out and have trained their eyes on Jorginho. But he would not come cheap
Cesare Casadei will spend the rest of the season on loan at Reading.

Should any of the deal materialise, the British transfer record on January’s transfer deadline day could be broken. Chelsea would likely break their own spending spree in 2011, when they signed Spanish striker Fernando Torres for £50m. Like Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur too are pushing for additions in their quest for a Champions League spot. They had a €45m move for Sporting CP right-back Pedro Porro refused last week, but according to transfer-market hound Fabrizio Romano they have finally reached full agreement. “Again after a very long meeting — €45m, payment terms finally approved after Sporting’s change last night Porro will travel to London tomorrow — he only wanted Spurs move,” he tweeted.
There, though, could be a bigger surprise, as Manchester City full-back Joao Cancelo could be bound for Bayern Munich for a loan spell that could then result in a 70m euro (£61.5m) move in the summer. The Portuguese has been one of Pep Guardiola’s mainstays and a benchmark for the new breed of play-making full-backs, but in the last month or so his form has digressed and he has been mostly cooling his heels on the bench with rumours of a fallout with Pep Guardiola swirling in the air. But City, who are generally quiet in the January window, are unlikely to search for a last-gasp replacement, as they have back-ups in Nathan Ake and Sergio Gomez.

Down the table, Crystal Palace would bolster their midfield with the acquisition of Stuttgart midfielder Naouirou Ahamada for £9.7m while Nottingham Forest are in talks with Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey. Should that materialise, it could be the club’s 26th signing of the season. Three of them were signed in January— Brazilian midfielders Danilo and Gustavo Scarpa, and forward Chris Wood—as they are keen on retaining their Premier League stature. They are supposedly in talks with wantaway Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who reportedly wants a move to the Premier League.
As the battle for survival heats up, Leeds United have managed a loan deal for Weston McKennie from Juventus. They are apparently negotiating with AS Roma forward Nicolo Zaniolo as well.
Late, shock moves
As is often the case there could be plenty of late shock moves too—Leicester City’s midfield general Youri Tielemans, whose contract ends this May, has several admirers, and the Foxes would rather rake in some moolah that let him depart for free. Manchester United have been long-time admirers and Christian Eriksen’s injury could make them push for a late interest in the Belgian. But it is likelier that United would settle for a short-fix, loan deal rather than purchasing Tielemans.

Farah, who won the Chicago Marathon in 2018 and is also the national record holder in the marathon, missed the London Marathon last year when he was forced to withdraw due to injury.
“I was really disappointed to miss last October’s London Marathon because of injury but I’m so happy the event has returned to April for 2023 as I don’t have to wait a whole year to get another chance,” Farah, who won 5,000 metres and 10,000m gold in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, said in a statement.
“The London Marathon has always been special to me and I am looking forward to being back out there on the roads of my home town.”
Farah will be joined by reigning Commonwealth Games 10,000 metres champion Eilish McColgan, who also withdrew ahead of her debut last year due to a medical issue. The 32-year-old is the daughter of the 1996 winner Liz McColgan.
“It was disappointing not to have taken part in last year’s London Marathon. I had such a fantastic summer on the track and the plan was always to follow that with my marathon debut in London,” the 2021 Birmingham Games gold medallist said.
“But I have been able to take further time to fully prepare for running a marathon and April will come around very quickly so I am extremely excited.

Messi regrets his viral ‘Que miras bobo’ comment during Qatar World Cup,"The Argentina captain spoke about the feisty clash with the Dutch which the South Americans won in a penalty shootout. A record 17 yellow cards were issued, including one to Messi for dissent.","World Cup winner Lionel Messi regretted his testy exchanges with the Netherlands coach and players during their controversial quarterfinal in Qatar, he said in an interview aired on Monday.
Messi gave his first interview since lifting the trophy in December to radio Urbana Play of Buenos Aires. The Argentina captain spoke about the feisty clash with the Dutch which the South Americans won in a penalty shootout. A record 17 yellow cards were issued, including one to Messi for dissent.
When Messi scored from the spot in regular time, he stood in front of Dutch coach Louis van Gaal and cupped both hands to his ears. After the game, he gesticulated to the Dutch bench and insulted striker Wout Weghorst, who scored twice in regulation.
“I don’t like what I did, I don’t like what happened afterward,” Messi said. “These are moments of a lot of tension, a lot of nerves. It is very quick and people react the way they react. Nothing was planned, it just happened.”
That quarterfinal was surrounded by controversy. Before the encounter, Van Gaal said his players were better prepared than their rivals for a penalty shootout. He also said “Messi did not touch the ball” in the semifinal between the teams in the 2014 World Cup; Argentina also won that tie in a penalty shootout.
Messi said his teammates told him what Van Gaal said to stimulate him.
About his moment with Weghorst, Messi said it was “natural.” In the mixed zone after the match, Messi had snapped at the Dutch striker saying, “Qué mirás, bobo? Qué mirás, bobo?… Andá para allá,” which loosely translates to “What are you looking at you fool? Go away.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“I reacted that way. There had been many things with this player, moments of tension like these . . . I was at the mixed zone, it had just happened,” Messi said. “I don’t like to leave that image, but these things happen.”
Messi also said Argentina “in general was better than its rivals” and picked Mexico, its second group opponent as “the toughest.”
“It was the worst match we played because of all the things involved in winning it or not,” Messi said. Argentina lost its opener to Saudi Arabia 2-1 in one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history, and had to beat Mexico to stay in playoffs contentions. Mexico was beaten 2-0.
Messi said he has not watched the final against France. Argentina won the final on penalties to win its first World Cup title since 1986.

“Since that day, everything changed for me,” he said. “By luck, what we dreamed about so much happened. I wished that so much in my career and, at the end, it came.”
Asked what he would tell Messi in his childhood if he could, the star said: “Something extraordinary awaits, you can’t imagine.

Jodhpur may become new IPL venue this season,"Jaipur’s Sawai Mansingh Stadium is the home for IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals and with the upcoming season to be played on the home-and-away format again, the association wants to have a few games at the new venue.","JODHPUR’s Barkatullah Khan Stadium might be added as a new venue for the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season. It is learnt that top officials of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) have orally expressed their desire to host a few IPL games there to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Jaipur’s Sawai Mansingh Stadium is the home for IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals and with the upcoming season to be played on the home-and-away format again, the association wants to have a few games at the new venue.
The Indian board, however, will send a team to assess the venue and submit its report to the IPL Governing Council, who will ask the RCA whether IPL games can be held at Jodhpur or not.
“It’s a verbal request. We have been told that RCA has rejuvenated the stadium, and have asked us if we can consider Jodhpur as a new venue for a few IPL games. The board will take a call on it only after the recce team submits its report,” a source in the BCCI confirmed.
To host an IPL game, the association has to provide certain basic facilities at each venue. However, BCCI’s major concern for the Jodhpur ground is the boundary size, which they feel is not up to the required distance.
The RCA had staged a few first-class games at Jodhpur this season. Ranji Trophy games were played at the venue after a gap of nearly two decades, when Rajasthan hosted Chhattisgarh and Services. The stadium has a capacity of 30,000 and was a venue for Legends League Cricket last year which was played under lights and attracted a packed house for veteran games.

Graham Reid scapegoated for India’s embarrassing hockey World Cup show,Reid helped India to a podium finish at Olympics but the administration has turned the heat on him instead of addressing the underlying issues – from lack of a grassroots programme to no professional league.,"Graham Reid came to India fearing he’d ‘lose the job in three months’. Instead, he stayed on as the chief coach for longer than any of his predecessors. And during this four-year period, the Australian learnt – and passionately sang – the national anthem, instilled a sense of calmness in the perennially chaotic world of Indian hockey and guided the team to unprecedented heights, including a return to the Olympic podium after four decades.
On Monday, a day after Germany were crowned champions and a week after India’s embarrassing exit from the World Cup, Hockey India claimed Reid had resigned as the coach. The federation did not clarify if any effort was made to convince the coach, who was responsible for India’s bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, to stay back. Or whether Reid, too, was allowed to leave as easily as Robin Arkell, the former strength and conditioning specialist, who is now an integral part of the backroom staff of world champions Germany.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/hockey/graham-reid-scapegoated-for-indias-embarrassing-hockey-world-cup-show-8413793/,sports

The 13-day-long sporting event will groom players for future international competitions like the Asiad, the Commonwealth and the Olympic Games, he said and pointed out that in the last edition of the KIYG, Madhya Pradesh had won 38 medals.
Earlier, Thakur said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sanctioned a budget of Rs 3,200 crore for the Khelo India programme for the next five years.

He said people associated with the event should organise the KIYG in such a manner that Madhya Pradesh is able to host the National Games and also other big sporting meets in the coming years.
The KIYG will be held at 23 venues across eight cities of the state in which nearly 6,000 athletes will take part in 27 different sports, an official said.
For the first time, sports like kayaking, canoeing, canoe slalom and fencing will be part of the Khelo India Youth Games.

For the second consecutive season both teams face-off in the quarterfinals. They entered the knockouts in contrasting styles and Bengal start as favourites thanks to an all-round squad that includes the experienced skipper Manoj Tiwary and Anustup Majumdar who are looking to get their hands on the trophy. With a potent attack at disposal, they should challenge Jharkhand on every front, who come into the game on the back of a defeat to Karnataka. Jharkhand need to play out of their skin to upstage Bengal.
Saurashtra vs Punjab at SCA Stadium, Rajkot
The absence of Cheteshwar Pujara, Jaydev Unadkat and Ravindra Jadeja has made this an even contest. This has been a mixed season so far for Saurashtra who defeated Mumbai but went on to lose to Andhra and Tamil Nadu. So going into the match, they need to bring their A game against a young Punjab side, who have reached this far thanks to a combined show. None of their batsmen have had a standout season and similarly their bowlers have just about done the job. Yet they have managed to get this far. Conditions at Rajkot will test the young batting line up led by Abhishek Sharma.
Karnataka vs Uttarakhand at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru
At the outset it looks a lop-sided contest with the hosts expected to make the semi-finals. Apart from having a wealth of experience in their ranks, Karnataka know how to close out crucial moments and have won titles in the past. With a potent attack that can pick 20 wickets, they are a force to reckon with in any condition and even more so at home. For Uttarakhand, this is a massive test. Starting the season with wins against Nagaland, Odisha and Himachal Pradesh gave them a head-start and gaining first- innings lead against Uttar Pradesh, Baroda and Haryana put them into the quarters.

Djokovic back at top of ATP rankings; Sabalenka No. 2 in WTA,His four-place rise from No. 5 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1 is the largest jump to the top spot in the 50-year history of the computerized rankings for men's tennis.,"Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open championship returned him to a rather familiar spot on Monday: No. 1 in the ATP rankings.
His four-place rise from No. 5 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1 is the largest jump to the top spot in the 50-year history of the computerized rankings for men’s tennis.
“You never know how much more time you have left, so, of course, I nurture and celebrate these moments of becoming No. 1 again and Grand Slam champion,” the 35-year-old Djokovic said after beating Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5) in the final at Melbourne Park on Sunday night, “even more than I have, maybe ever in my career. I don’t take it for granted.”
WATCH: ‘There's still a lot of that fire inside of me that is burning of passion for the sport and for competition,’ said Novak Djokovic, as he resumed his reign over Melbourne Park by winning a record-extending 10th Australian Open title https://t.co/GCGbJYDErX #AO23 pic.twitter.com/JPnEf8o9Z8
— Reuters Sports (@ReutersSports) January 31, 2023
Aryna Sabalenka’s first major title moved her up from No. 5 to a career-best-equaling No. 2 in the WTA rankings, behind only three-time major champion Iga Swiatek.
Ons Jabeur, twice a finalist at Slams in 2022, went from No. 2 to No. 3, followed by No. 4 Jessica Pegula, No. 5 Caroline Garcia and No. 6 Coco Gauff.
The player Sabalenka beat in Saturday’s Australian Open final, Elena Rybakina, makes her top 10 debut at No. 10, up from No. 25.
This marks Djokovic’s 374th week leading the ATP, adding to his record. He earned a 10th title at the Australian Open and tied Rafael Nadal with 22 Grand Slam trophies.
Alcaraz slid to No. 2. He had become the youngest man to be No. 1 when he took over at age 19 after winning the U.S. Open last September. Alcaraz missed the Australian Open because of a leg injury.

Nadal, who hurt his left hip flexor during a second-round loss to Mackenzie McDonald of the United States, dropped from No. 2 to No. 6.
Tsitsipas went from No. 4 to No. 3 because of his run in Melbourne; he would have been No. 1 for the first time if he had managed to win the title. Casper Ruud, a two-time Grand Slam runner-up who lost in the second round to Jenson Brooksby of the United States, went from No. 3 to No. 4. Andrey Rublev is No. 5 after getting to the quarterfinals.
Cracking the top 20 for the first time is Tommy Paul, a 25-year-old American who reached his first Grand Slam semifinal before exiting against Djokovic. Paul’s showing in Melbourne lifted him 16 spots from No. 25 to No. 19.

The 51-year-old succeeds Lampard, who was sacked last week after a poor run of form left the team in a relegation battle.
“It’s an honour to become Everton manager. My staff and I are ready and eager to help get this great club back on track,” Dyche said in a statement.

Lampard was appointed in January 2022 after managing his former club Chelsea and Derby County, in the second tier.
Everton had been floundering under the former England international, having last won a league game in October when they beat Crystal Palace 3-0 at home.

Lampard’s last game in charge was last weekend’s 2-0 league defeat by West Ham United, which kept Everton second-bottom of the standings on 15 points after 20 games, above Southampton on goal difference and two points adrift of the safety zone.
Dyche has been out of work since last April when he was sacked by Burnley, where he transformed the fortunes of the Lancashire club during his nearly 10 years in charge.

He was the longest-serving English top flight manager when he was relieved of his duties as Burnley headed towards relegation last season.
During Dyche’s tenure Burnley were promoted twice from the Championship, achieved two top-half Premier League finishes and qualified for Europe for the first time in 51 years.

Bayern Munich winless in 2023 and searching for answers,Bayern Munich hasn’t won a game yet this year.,"The Bavarian powerhouse has seen its Bundesliga lead shrink from four points before the World Cup to just one since the league’s return.
Three draws in three games — all 1-1 — to Leipzig, Cologne, then Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, have prompted another round of introspection and piled the pressure on coach Julian Nagelsmann ahead of the decisive stage of the season.
Bayern visits Mainz in the third round of the German Cup on Wednesday, two weeks before the team’s trip to Paris Saint-Germain for the first leg of their Champions League knockout clash.
Though it hadn’t been expected to make any further winter signings, Bayern was reportedly close Monday to tying up a surprise loan deal for Portugal left back João Cancelo from Manchester City. It would give Bayern more security in defense and an added attacking threat on the left.
It’s not the first time Bayern has slumped this season — the 10-time defending champions went four Bundesliga games without a win in September — but this time there’s little room for error and less time to correct them.
Bayern had two weeks off to regroup after the team’s 1-0 loss at Augsburg on Sept. 17. At the time, Nagelsmann was reportedly summoned for intensive discussions with his superiors and he prepared a detailed analysis of the entire team. Kicker magazine reported that the players were amazed when Nagelsmann later pointed out their individual mistakes in personal consultations with each.
On Saturday, Nagelsmann complained that the players were making the same mistakes and a lack of confidence is playing a role. It’s a vicious circle.
ADVERTISEMENT
“When you don’t win, confidence isn’t so high,” Nagelsmann said. “We can do a lot more to regain confidence. There are many things we could do better, and speeding up the game is a very important one.”
Bayern struggled to create chances against Frankfurt, Cologne and Leipzig’s well-organized defenses.
“We only play through the wings, hardly ever through the center,” Nagelsmann said after the draw with Frankfurt.
After the draw against Cologne — also at home — Nagelsmann said off-field distractions such as Serge Gnabry’s criticized trip to Paris Fashion Week and injuries to team captain Manuel Neuer and Senegal star Sadio Mané were just “excuses” for the team’s poor form.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We’re all professionals, they want to win games,” Nagelsmann said.
Before the league’s extended winter break, Bayern had won 10 games straight across all competitions, including wins over Inter Milan and Barcelona in the Champions League.

Premier League signs NFT deal with SoftBank-backed Sorare,"The deal gives Sorare a four-year license to sell digital sports cards of players from all 20 Premier League clubs, Sorare said in a statement on Monday.","The Premier League is partnering with French fantasy sports platform Sorare to sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a sign that the sporting world is continuing to embrace digital assets despite the rout in markets.
The deal gives Sorare a four-year license to sell digital sports cards of players from all 20 Premier League clubs, Sorare said in a statement on Monday.
Sky News reported in October that the deal could be worth 30 million pounds ($37.13 million) per year. Sorare declined to comment on whether the figure cited by Sky News was accurate.
The cards in Sorare’s game are bought and traded in the form of NFTs, a kind of blockchain-based asset, using either cryptocurrency or traditional currency.
Paris-based Sorare raised $680 million at a $4.3 billion valuation in a 2021 funding round led by SoftBank.
Britain’s gambling watchdog has been investigating Sorare since 2021 to assess whether its game amounts to gambling. Sorare CEO Nicolas Julia said at a journalists’ briefing last week the probe was still ongoing. Elsewhere, France’s gambling regulator told the company in November to make changes to the game, including expanding its free-to-play option.
“The way that supporters follow their favourite teams and players is evolving and the Premier League is always looking for ways to engage with fans,” said Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League.
NFT GAMING
ADVERTISEMENT
NFTs surged in 2021, but prices and sales volumes plunged last year as investors turned cautious and the crypto industry was rocked by a series of high-profile collapses.
Many top soccer teams and sports stars promoted crypto assets – such as NFTs or “fan tokens” – to fans during the boom. Proponents say they can be used to increase fan engagement, but critics say they risk encouraging financial speculation.
Members of the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA), which represents fans in England and Wales, “have been raising concerns about crypto-based engagement partnerships at their clubs for many years,” a spokesperson said, commenting on football’s engagement with crypto in general, before Sorare’s announcement. “Supporter engagement shouldn’t be monetised.”
“The lack of regulatory oversight for crypto and NFTs is obviously something which supporters should be aware of,” the FSA added.
The average sale price of a Sorare NFT dropped to around $38 in December, down from a peak of $281 in March 2021, but the number of Sorare monthly buyers and transactions is near an all-time high, according to blockchain tracker CryptoSlam.

Julia said the company, which has more than 3 million users, has “trended very differently from the rest of the space” because its NFTs have “utility value”.
“We never market the game as an investment… it’s a collectible that you can play in a game.”
Julia said 87% of current users play the game without spending money on the platform.

Run machine Smith wins fourth Allan Border medal,"Smith polled 171 votes, while nearest rival Travis Head managed 144, to claim Australian cricket's greatest individual honour which he had previously won in 2015, 2018 and 2021.","Australia run machine Steve Smith clinched his fourth Allan Border Medal on Monday, becoming only the third player, after Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke, to achieve the feat.
Smith polled 171 votes, while nearest rival Travis Head managed 144, to claim Australian cricket’s greatest individual honour which he had previously won in 2015, 2018 and 2021.
Former captain Smith racked up 1,524 runs, which included four hundreds, during the voting period and was crucial to Australia’s rise to number one in the test rankings.
Such was his domination in the two other formats that it did not matter in the end that Smith did not poll a single vote in the T20 Internationals.
Smith will be one of Australia’s key figures as they embark on a four-test tour in India where they hope to secure their place in the final of the World Test Championship.
The 33-year-old has been in strong form in 50-overs cricket too and famously quipped “I’m back, baby” during an ODI against England in November after a successful technique tweak.
He, however, lost the men’s ODI player of the year award to David Warner on countback, while Marcus Stoinis won the T20 honours ahead of Josh Hazlewood.

Opener Usman Khawaja claimed the Shane Warne award for the men’s test player of the year after a prolific 12 months during which he scored 1,020 at an average of 78.46.

Real, who won previously in 2014 and then three successive tournaments from 2016 to 2018, are on course for a showdown with Flamengo of Brazil in the final but both must play a semi-final match first before they can set up an intriguing decider in Rabat on Feb. 11.
European clubs have won the last nine editions of the event, dominating since 2012 when Brazil’s Corinthians beat Chelsea in the final in Japan in a rare South American success.
Last year’s Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners only join once the tournament reaches the final four stage but it begins on Wednesday when Egypt’s Al Ahly, who qualify as one of two African representatives, meet Auckland City in Tangier in an opening playoff tie.
The Oceania champions from New Zealand compete for a record 10th time in the tournament against the equally experienced Cairo giants, who are at their eighth Club World Cup.
That winner advances to a quarter-final clash on Saturday against Seattle Sounders. The U.S. club won last year’s CONCACAF Champions League but had a miserable Major League Soccer campaign.
African champions Wydad Casablanca can expect passionate home support for their game the same day against Asian counterparts Al Hilal from Saudi Arabia. Wydad’s squad includes three players from the Morocco team that reached the World Cup semi-final in Qatar in December.

Flamengo will only play their first game in the semi-final on Feb. 7 and Real Madrid one day later.
The tournament will be used to experiment further tweaks to the Video Assistant Referee system as referees will, for the first time, explain the reasons for VAR decisions to the crowd at the stadium and the television audience.
During the trial, referees will relay their decisions via a microphone connected to the public address system, though their conversation with video officials will remain private.

Graham Reid resigns as India men’s hockey team coach following World Cup exit,The Indian hockey team finished joint-ninth at the 2023 FIH Men's World Cup held in Odisha.,"Indian men’s hockey team coach Graham Reid, who had guided India to a historic bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, resigned from his post on Monday.
His decision to step down came in the aftermath of India’s disappointing showing at the 2023 FIH Men’s Hockey World Cup which ended on Sunday. India finished joint-ninth, alongside Argentina, out of 16 teams at the marquee event held in Odisha. It was the lowest-ever finish by a host nation in the event’s history.
“It is now time for me to step aside and hand over the reigns to the next management,” he was quoted as saying in a media release.
“It has been an honour and privilege to work with the team and Hockey India and I have enjoyed every moment of this epic journey. I wish the team all the very best.”
India’s 0-0 draw against England put them in second place in their pool, forcing them to play a crossover match against New Zealand which they lost in shootouts, after blowing a two-goal lead. Their subsequent wins – 8-0 over Japan, and 5-2 over South Africa – were just enough to ensure they did not stoop to their worst-ever World Cup finish.
Reid ends a relatively successful stint as India’s coach. On top of the medal at the Olympics in 2021, he also steered the men in blue to a third-place finish in the 2021/22 FIH Hockey Pro League season, and led them to victory in the 2019 FIH Series final.

Leg-spinner Parshavi Chopra, opener Shweta Sehrawat, pacer Titas Sadhu, off-break bowler Archana Devi and left-arm spinner Mannat Kashyap were among the standout performers of the U-19 side that outplayed England in the final in Potchefstroom on Sunday.
Mithali, who was invited by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to interact with the cricketers ahead of the inaugural edition, feels women’s cricket has finally got a platform from where the players can be fast-tracked or groomed for the future.
“The spinners and seamers have been very impressive and in both the departments we need improvement at the senior level. It’s always good to have more options and build a solid pool of players.
“When you compare to the highest level, there is obviously bit of difference in terms of standards, technique and temperament at the U-19 level.
“We will have to work on them. And from what I saw in South Africa, they are really good,” Mithali, who called time on a 23-year-old illustrious international career last year, told PTI.

The leading run-getter in women’s ODI cricket said the NCA in Bengaluru prepared the team well for the first ever global age-group event.

Going forward, she wants all the squad members of the victorious outfit to toil on the domestic circuit while the three or four who are ready for the higher level can be slowly drafted into the national side.
“Playing domestic cricket is very important for them and should not be neglected. WPL will also get them the required exposure.
“The next ODI World Cup is at home and we have not won a global event yet at the senior level. I am sure the BCCI is prioritising that and will keep these players in the mix,” said the champion batter.
With the talent pool not as big as men’s cricket, the probability of the women’s U-19 players reaching international cricket increases significantly. On an average, one or two from the Men’s U-19 World Cup go on to play for India but Mithali feels the number should be higher in women’s cricket.

She also fondly recalled her interactions with the Shafali Verma-led squad before the start of the tournament in South Africa.
“It was not much of a technical conversation. It was more about the preparation and they had lots of questions on that. Things like how to prepare because these girls are very young and there is a lot of difference in team training and personal training. I spoke about how to make the transition.

“They are very keen learners and because of the level they are at, they are very energetic as well,” she said.
Mithali was also all praise for Women’s U-19 head coach Nooshin Al Khadeer.
“She has worked tirelessly with this bunch of cricketers and deserves all the credit. She has done well in all her assignments whether it is with the Railways in domestic cricket and now at the India U-19 level.” Asked if Nooshin is ready to coach the senior India team, Mithali replied in the affirmative.
“Yes, of course.”

"Fire still burning, Djokovic and GOAT debate move on to Paris","That debate may never be settled but if it is to be decided purely in terms of major championship success, it now moves on to the French Open in the European spring with the Serbian and Rafael Nadal tied on 22 titles.","A triumphant Novak Djokovic paraded the Australian Open trophy around the gardens of Melbourne’s Government House on Monday, his 10th title having added another notch in the plus column for those who argue he is the Greatest Of All Time (GOAT).
That debate may never be settled but if it is to be decided purely in terms of major championship success, it now moves on to the French Open in the European spring with the Serbian and Rafael Nadal tied on 22 titles.
While the blue courts of Melbourne Park are undoubtedly Djokovic’s domain, the red clay courts of Roland Garros are the preserve of Spaniard Nadal, the other open-era GOAT contender along with 20-times Grand Slam champion Roger Federer.
Federer is now retired and sent his congratulations to Djokovic on Instagram – “Incredible effort, again!” – but Nadal was back in Spain being treated for the latest in a series of injuries that have blighted his career.

The 36-year-old is confident he will recover from the hip flexor issue he sustained at the Australian Open in time to drag his battered body to Paris in May in a bid for a 15th French Open title.
And, despite a hamstring issue that hindered him throughout the year’s first Grand Slam, Djokovic left little doubt that he would also be there trying to win major number 23.
“I think there’s still a lot of that fire inside of me that is burning of passion for the sport and for competition and I think that’s what allows me to still push myself to the limit,” he said on Monday. “In the practice sessions, day in, day out after so many years to go through the same routines, repetitively, that sometimes is not so interesting.

“But I know that there is always a greater goal and a guiding star, so to say, and this trophy is one of those guiding stars, it’s something that I always strive to achieve.”
While the resilience shown by Djokovic and Nadal means men’s tennis can continue to enjoy the back end of the most glittering of golden eras, women’s tennis continues with its first season trying to fill the void left by Serena Williams.
The American, when fit, dominated the women’s game for the best part of two decades while hoovering up 23 Grand Slam singles titles – a tally only bettered by Australian Margaret Court (24) mostly in the amateur era.

Even if Djokovic’s opposition to COVID-19 vaccines keeps him out of the U.S. Open for a second year running, Sunday’s title put him firmly in touching distance of those tallies.

"This is just the beginning, says Shafali after U-19 WC triumph","Shafali, 19, has already established herself in India's senior side and wants to make the visit to South Africa even more memorable with another silverware.","Not content with the U-19 T20 World Cup triumph, batting sensation Shafali Verma has already set her sights on replicating the success with the senior women’s team in less than two weeks’ time.
She will get her chance when the Women’s T20 World Cup gets underway from February 10 in South Africa, the same country where the country just won the inaugural U-19 world tournament.

“No, the big one also,” Shafali said when asked if the U-19 trophy was the only one she was hoping to take back from South Africa.
“I am someone who focuses on task at hand. When I entered the Under-19s, I only focused on winning the Under-19 Cup and we have won that today (Sunday).
“I will look to take this winning confidence with me and win the senior World Cup. I will try and forget this and get involved with the senior setup and gel with the team and win the World Cup,” she was quoted as saying by the ICC.
India on Sunday won their maiden ICC title in women’s cricket as a bunch of supremely talented teenagers lifted the inaugural U-19 World Cup with a seven-wicket victory over England.
The Shafali-led India squad managed to do what their seniors could not by clearing the final hurdle in a global event. India first bundled out England for 68 in 17.1 overs and then returned to knock off the paltry target in 14 overs to lift the coveted trophy.

Shafali was part of India’s squad that fell at the final hurdle at the 2020 T20 World Cup, when Australia defeated the side by 85 runs in front of more than 85,000 fans at the MCG. She said she still feels the pain from the loss.
“Melbourne was a very emotional day for me in that final game, we didn’t win the game,” Shafali recalled.

Curator is right person to answer that question: Bowling coach Paras Mhambrey on Ekana pitch,"India skipper Hardik Pandya on Sunday slammed the standard of pitches used in the ongoing series against New Zealand and called the pitch at the Ekana Cricket Stadium a ""shocker"".","India’s bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said the curator is the “right person” to describe the track prepared for the second T20I against New Zealand here.
India skipper Hardik Pandya on Sunday slammed the standard of pitches used in the ongoing series against New Zealand and called the pitch at the Ekana Cricket Stadium a “shocker”.
The ball turned in the first T20I in Ranchi and it was no different on Sunday when New Zealand were restricted to 99 for eight.
India chased down the target with only one ball to spare.
“The curator is the right person to answer that question (on pitch). But definitely we knew it would be a big challenge and luckily we controlled the game.
“Anything in the range of 120-130 would have been really challenging. We did well to restrict them to 99 and it was an achievable target,” Mhambrey said at the post-match press conference.
Mhambrey further said the wicket looked challenging from the outset.
“When we saw the wicket, we realised it was on the drier side. There was a little grass covering on the middle, but there was none on both ends. When we came yesterday, it looked like it would turn and we realised it would be challenging,” he said.

The former Mumbai seamer lauded the bowlers for doing a fine job in the second match.
India left out tearaway pacer Umran Malik for an extra spinner in Yuzvendra Chahal, who bagged figures of 2-1-4-1.
The other three spinners in Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, and Deepak Hooda also took one wicket each while bowling economically.
He said Chahal bowled in the powerplay as a right-hander was batting during that phase of the game on a turning wicket.

The pitch took out an even contest between bat and ball. You could argue that in T20s the balance of the game is heavily tilted in batsmen’s favour. But it is what the format dictates. Thousands of people sacrifice their evenings to turn up at a stadium or switch their television sets or open their OTT platforms to watch batsmen teeing off from the start.

“I’m really excited to work with him, to develop him, and I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do in a Newcastle shirt.”

When asked what was running through his head, Sanjeev, who runs a small-scale imitation jewellery business, gave an answer apt for a shopkeeper. “Bas aaj women team ko bauni karni hai ji (I just want the women’s team to open their account),” father Sanjeev said.
He was referring to the missing World Cup trophy in the Indian women’s team’s cabinet. The closest India has been to wrapping their arms around a world trophy was back in 2017 in the 50-over format where they lost to England by 9 runs. But Sunday was India’s day.

Brighton strike late to knock holders Liverpool out of FA Cup,"Harvey Elliott put Liverpool ahead, Lewis Dunk equalised before halftime and the score stayed at 1-1 until Mitoma found the net in the 92nd minute with a fine finish.","Holders Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup after losing 2-1 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the fourth round on Sunday as Kaoru Mitoma struck the winning goal in stoppage time.
Harvey Elliott put Liverpool ahead, Lewis Dunk equalised before halftime and the score stayed at 1-1 until Mitoma found the net in the 92nd minute with a fine finish.
It was the second time Brighton defeated Liverpool in two weeks, having also beaten Juergen Klopp’s side 3-0 in the Premier League.
“Unbelievable ending. Sometimes you’ve got to win a game like that. We weren’t at our best today. Nowhere near it. But we ground it out against a top side and got the win,” Dunk told ITV Sport.

“We feel like we can beat anyone on our best days and we showed here we can beat them on our not-so-good days. We’ve got everything in our squad to keep pushing on and hopefully we can go further in the competition.”
Earlier, Liverpool’s teenage midfielder Elliott put them ahead in the 30th minute with a low shot into the far corner following a clever pass from Mohamed Salah.
Brighton equalised nine minutes later when Dunk got a flick on a long-range effort from Tariq Lamptey which deflected into the goal, with goalkeeper Alisson Becker wrong-footed.
Elliott, who also scored in Liverpool’s win in the third- round replay, could have made it 2-1 before halftime as he latched on to Cody Gakpo’s pass but Lamptey made a superb last-ditch tackle.

ANOTHER CHANCE

Liverpool had another chance on the hour mark when Salah connected with a wonderful pass from James Milner but the Egypt forward chose to whip in a cross instead of taking a shot and Brighton keeper Jason Steele easily blocked it.
The tie looked set for a replay when Brighton’s Solly March missed a golden opportunity to score in the 71st minute when he failed to beat the onrushing Alisson from close range after Mitoma set him up with a brilliant low cross.
But Mitoma took things into his own hands, scoring a superb goal following a free kick as he controlled the ball on the half volley, dummied and rifled it home.
It was another disappointing result for Liverpool who have struggled with form and injuries this season and are ninth in the Premier League standings.
“This season has been nowhere near good enough. At the start of the year, we wanted a fresh start but that hasn’t happened. We’ve been worse,” Liverpool defender Andy Robertson said.

“In the league, we haven’t been good enough and now we’re out of both cups,” he added.

"Inspired by England, Travis Head aims to attack India",Head's past outings in the sub-continent fetched him 213 runs from 11 innings at 21.30.,"Inspired by England’s daredevilry in Pakistan, Australian batter Travis Head will shun his conservative approach on spinning pitches and enter the Test series against India with an aim to dominate the opposition bowling attack.
India and Australia will face off in the upcoming four-Test Gavaskar-Border Trophy, starting with the opener on February 9.
“Watching the way England played in Pakistan, I’ve probably looked back and wasn’t as positive as I’d like to be against spin in those series,” Head was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald ahead of the team’s departure for India.
“I feel like the way I played throughout this series against spin – I know it’s completely different being in Australia – but the more positive I am, the better I am with my feet and the better I am in defence.”
Travis Head goes BANG! 💥 #BBL12 pic.twitter.com/dmeWPgKBbR
— KFC Big Bash League (@BBL) January 24, 2023
“We’ve seen that with fast bowling this summer. When I hunt the ball, my front foot defence is probably the best it’s been and I think I’ve got to go over there with a positive mindset, not a defensive one.” In his three previous series in Asia, against Pakistan in 2018 and 2022 and Sri Lanka last year, Head has struggled to put the bowlers under slow bowlers.
His past outings in the sub-continent fetched him 213 runs from 11 innings at 21.30.
“I think I may have been a bit on the defensive side in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which you’ve always got a ball on your name over there,” Head said.
“But get over there, we’ve got a long time to get settled over there, and get the lay of the land and understand what my role might be. It could be low-scoring, it could be high-scoring, you might need to get big scores, or a 40, 50, 60 might win you a Test match.”
Handscomb in reckoning for Nagpur Test

Australia are mulling the option of bringing back Peter Handscomb to bat in the middle-order for his ability to play spin, if Cameron Green does not recover in time for their series opener against India from February 9, head coach and selector Andrew McDonald indicated.
Recovering from a fractured finger, seam-bowling all-rounder Green is also named in the Test squad alongside Handscomb.
“He’s really important,” McDonald was quoted saying in the Sydney Morning Herald.

“It’s been well documented over a period of time that his play against spin is excellent, and we feel as though he’s returned probably to what he was producing two or three years ago.” Both Handscomb and Green are undergoing batting practices on tailor-made “scarified” pitches in the sultry conditions of Bon Andrews Oval in North Sydney for them to experience match simulation ahead of the four-Test series that will determine their World Test Championship Final qualification.
Handscomb was also a member of their last tour to India in 2017. He also provides the utility value by doubling up as a wicketkeeper.

“Lots of runs in Shield cricket on those slower surfaces as well. He’s able to keep as well, so it gives us every option for Josh (Inglis) not to be there and if anything were to happen to Alex Carey, there’s flexibility there, but also in close fielder as well, bat pad, highly valued when you tour the subcontinent.
“We see him as an important right-hand option. Got a lot of left-handers, so very important right-hand option for us. If there were to be any late changes, or Cameron Green doesn’t make that first Test, we feel we have some good options.
“We value his (Green) batting first and foremost really, he’s a batter in our top six and we value that, his bowling is a bonus,” McDonald added. “Where he’s positioned at the moment, his biggest challenge is bowling. There is a lack of loading there, and it’s one of the key reasons around us getting into this camp and this mode early.

Sean Johnson made one save for the U.S. while Alvaro Montero had two for Colombia.
There weren’t as many scoring opportunities in the final 45 minutes after a back-and-forth first half. A Walker Zimmerman try in the 54th minute was the best chance for the Americans until a free kick in the 90th minute, when Kellyn Acosta’s service was just out of the reach of Brandon Vazquez in the middle of the box.

Shakira set to release new song on her and Gerard Pique’s birthday: Report,Shakira made a huge sum of money from an earlier song where she seemingly took a dig at Pique and his new girlfriend 23-year-old Clara Chia Marti.,"Shakira will release a new track on her and now ex-partner Gerard Pique’s common birthday which falls on February 2, according to a report by Marca as per SPORTbible. Although there are rumours that Pique might be a topic again, it will be less direct and more subtle.
The tune is with Karol G and the video was filmed in two days, according to the report.
Shakira made a huge sum of money from an earlier song where she seemingly took a dig at Pique and his new girlfriend 23-year-old Clara Chia Marti. As per Marca, Telecinco’s morning show ‘El Programa de Ana Rosa’, Shakira has collected a whole lot of money from various streaming services for her most recent release.
As per reports in Spanish media, Shakira is said to have made $512,000 from YouTube, $500,000 from Amazon Music, $360,000 from Spotify and $1,200,000 from Apple Music – bringing the total to $2,500,000.
‘Te felicito’ was another song also released with a subtle mention to Pique and that earned the She-Wolf singer $10 million.
Overall, with the two-month old track ‘Monotonia’ featuring Ozuna factored in, it’s estimated Shakira has added an extra $15 million for music about her past relationship
The song logged in more than 63 million views on YouTube, making it the most watched new Latin song in YouTube history.

Girona stymied the league front-runner until Pedri’s fellow substitute, Jordi Alba, found him with a low cross at close range in the 61st. Pedri, who won the 2021 Golden Boy for the continent’s most promising under-21 player, is considered one of the pillars of Barcelona’s post-Messi rebuild.

Australia, who haven’t won a Test series in India since 2004, will also play in New Delhi (February 17-21), Dharamsala (March 1-5) and Ahmedabad (March 9-13).
The Tests will be followed by three ODIs — Mumbai (March 17), Visakhapatnam (March 19) and Chennai (March 22).
While Maxwell will miss the Tests, he might be back for the limited over series.

India had 31 circle penetrations in total while South Africa had 22.","A dominant India scored twice in the first and fourth quarters to beat South Africa 5-2 in a classification match and finish joint ninth in the FIH Men’s World Cup here on Saturday.
World number six India earned six penalty corners in the match and scored one from them while South Africa, ranked 14th, got three PCs without converting any one of them. India had 31 circle penetrations in total while South Africa had 22.
With around 60 per cent ball possession, the home side had 14 shots at goal as against nine by South Africa.
Abhishek, who was named player of the match, opened the scoring for India in the fifth minute before captain Harmanpreet Singh struck from his drag flick in the 12th minute.
The second quarter did not yield any goal from either side though India kept on attacking and made several circle penetration.
India, who led 2-0 at half time, had 15 circle penetration as against eight by South Africa at the breather.
In the third quarter, Amit Rohidas was shown a yellow card and India had to play one man short for five minutes.

But once Rohidas came back, India scored a goal in the last minute of the third quarter through Shamsher Singh (45th).
The South Africans did better in the second half as they made more circle penetration than the first 30 minutes.
The fourth quarter produced four goals — two from each side.
India’s fourth goal came in the 49th minute from a fine team effort. Off a Raj Kumar Pal pass, Jarmanpreet Singh sent a low cross from near the right side which Akashdeep simply tapped in.

But just a few seconds later, South Africa scored their first goal of the match through Mvimbi Samkelo (49th), who controlled a long scoop from a teammate inside the Indian ‘D’ and then fired a powerful shot past India custodian PR Sreejesh.
Sukhjeet was suspended for five minutes in the 50th minute after getting a yellow card for a foul and India were one man down. But South Africa failed to capitalise on this.
Sukhjeet returned to score India’s fifth goal in the 58th minute. Akashdeep was involved in the goal as his reverse shot rebounded from the South Africa goalkeeper and Sukhjeet was at the right place to slam the ball home.
South Africa earned a penalty stroke with just one minute left in the match after Sreejesh fouled Cassiem Mustaphaa in the Indian circle.

Mustaphaa himself stepped up and scored from the spot as the Birsa Munda Stadium saw India win for the final time in this World Cup.

"Pogba, Vlahovic have recovered, ready for Monza game: Allegri","Pogba had a knee operation in September, while Vlahovic has not played for Juventus since their Champions League clash against Benfica in October.","Midfielder Paul Pogba and striker Dusan Vlahovic will be ready for Juventus’ Serie A home match against Monza on Sunday, manager Massimiliano Allegri said on Saturday.
Both players are returning from lengthy injury absences. Pogba had a knee operation in September, while Vlahovic has not played for Juventus since their Champions League clash against Benfica in October.
“Vlahovic and Pogba will be available, (Juan) Cuadrado could be back against Lazio and (Leonardo) Bonucci is still behind,” Allegri told reporters on Saturday.
Italy forward Federico Chiesa, who recently recovered from an anterior cruciate ligament injury which kept him out of action for 10 months, is not yet available however.

Stefanos Tsitsipas tasked with Mission Impossible – stopping Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open,"Stefanos Tsitsipas will need his strong serve and forehand to fire if he wishes to contend with Novak Djokovic, who is in top form, and 27 matches unbeaten in Melbourne.","Novak Djokovic is 40 matches unbeaten in Australia. His 27-match-winning streak at the Australian Open is now an all-time record. He has not dropped more than eight games in each of his last three straight-sets wins.
And now, as he takes on Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, there is more than just a Grand Slam title at stake.
The Serb is vying for a record-extending 10th singles title in Melbourne, which will equal Rafael Nadal’s all-time Major record of 22. Tsitsipas, after reaching the semifinal at three of the last four Australian Opens, is in his first Major final. The winner is also confirmed to usurp the World No. 1 spot from Carlos Alcaraz in the rankings.
For Djokovic, though, this match is the culmination of a redemption arc following one of the most bizarre and polarising storylines in modern sport. The Serb’s decision to refuse to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and his deportation from Australia last year has led to plenty of detractors, and also a battle with the media with him claiming that he has incorrectly been portrayed as a “villain of the world”.
The distractions have piled up. His entire campaign this fortnight has been under the shadow of a hamstring injury, due to which he has not been practising in between matches, and there have been some – to Djokovic’s evident scorn – who have questioned the legitimacy of the injury.
Then come the optics of what took place on Wednesday night. The Serb’s father, Srdjan, was not present in his box for his semifinal win against Tommy Paul after he was filmed with Vladimir Putin supporters outside the stadium in demonstrations that were meant to be banned in Melbourne Park. A clarification came from the Djokovic clan soon after, but he admitted to being affected by the negative attention.
In the background of all that external strife, Djokovic has shown his trademark steel on court, his form full of menace and fury as he has used the storm surrounding his polarising public personality to fuel his fire and produce some of his most commanding tennis.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tsitsipas has the small challenge of doing what nobody has been able to do since Hyeon Chung in 2018 – beating Djokovic in Melbourne.
Serve & forehand combination
Much of the reason why Djokovic has always had an upper hand on Tsitsipas – he has won 10 of their previous 12 encounters – is because he nullifies the Greek’s strengths.
Tsitsipas bases his game on a powerful and versatile serve that allows him to stay in sets and take them to tiebreakers, even when he is not at his best. At this tournament, he has held serve 92 per cent of the time, and has won 84 per cent of the points on his first serve, making him the most reliable server in the men’s draw.
EXPLAINED
The Longer Exchanges
Despite the 7-5, 6-1, 6-2 scoreline, Tommy Paul managed to make life difficult for Djokovic in the semifinal – especially in the first set when the Serb blew a 5-1 lead – by elongating the rallies. He won more points (16) than Djokovic (12) when the rallies lasted longer than 9 shots, a stat that seems impossible given the legacy of incredible baseline defence that Djokovic has created over the past decade. But on Friday, in the breeze of the cool, night conditions, and troubled by his hamstring, Djokovic went through a physical lapse, with his movement slightly restricted. Paul clocked in on that, and himself a great mover, began making Djokovic work harder for points, moving him side-to-side and elongating the rallies to force hasty errors, winning four games in a row. For all the talk about Djokovic’s hamstring injury, Paul was the first player since the second round that actually tested it. Tsitsipas may take a page out of the American’s book, and contrary to how he has approached his matchup with Djokovic in the past, may use his forehand to move the Serb more, and extend the length of the rallies, to take advantage of his superior physical condition.
But there is no player better at dealing with big servers than Djokovic, who is arguably the greatest returner in the history of the game. He is able to rob opponents of momentum and time through varying return positioning, and by being able to hit them both deep and wide, giving him an array of options to neutralise Tsitsipas’ serving threat.

A big serve allows Tsitsipas to get his forehand into play, on which he applies spin and depth. But without needing to constantly compete on the forehand, Djokovic is able to bring his legendary backhand into play, which he can relentlessly hit crosscourt to push Tsitsipas wider and wider on his weaker one-handed backhand, either forcing an error or opening up the court for himself to take command of the rallies.
Tsitsipas will need both his serve and forehand to be in top form to be able to compete, especially to give himself a good start, before his more experienced opponent clocks in on his weaknesses.
More than anything, this will be a tough mental test for the Greek. He has so many shots in his tennis repertoire, a well-formed technique, and is coming into the peak of his physical conditioning. Here, he has another chance to prove that the mental lapses that have cost him in the past, do not come in the way again. A win on Sunday – as unlikely as it may currently seem – would be a huge statement.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/stefanos-tsitsipas-tasked-with-mission-impossible-stopping-novak-djokovic-at-the-australian-open-8410020/,sports
Why a family in Unnao is buying an inverter to watch Indian girls in Sunday’s Under-19 cricket World Cup final,"Savitri Devi, the mother of India's bowling allrounder Archana, is worried her smartphone, gifted by her cricketer-daughter, running out of charge during power outage in Ratai Purwa village.","ON SUNDAY, Savitri Devi, the mother of India’s bowling allrounder Archana, plans to buy a locally made inverter in UP’s Unnao. She doesn’t want her new smartphone — gifted by her daughter — to run out of charge in case there is a power cut during the final of the inaugural ICC Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup.
The junior Indian girls take on England at Potchefstroom in South Africa, and at stake is history in the making — a first-ever ICC title for a women’s team from India. The senior team were runners-up in 2005 and 2017 in the 50-over format, and lost to Australia in the T20 World Cup final in 2020.
In a month when broadcast rights for the Women’s Premier League sold for Rs 951 crore and corporates paid Rs 4,699 crore to own the five teams, a victory for India will be the icing on the cake for women’s cricket – and, of course, a memorable day for parents like Savitri, who lost her husband Shivram in 2007.
“There is no guarantee of electricity in our village tomorrow. Hence, I have collected money to buy an inverter. My daughter is in the team playing the World Cup final and we hope to watch the match on my mobile phone without any interruption,” Savitri told The Indian Express from Ratai Purwa, a village of about 400 residents.

Before Archana started performing on the cricket field, Devi’s story was one of setbacks. After her husband, she lost her younger son Budhiman to a snake bite six years ago. The same year, Archana was taken under the wings of coach Poonam Gupta and Kapil Pandey, the coach of India men’s star spinner Kuldeep Yadav.
“I worked on our 1-acre farm and sold milk from the two cows we owned to make ends meet. People used to taunt me because I sent Archana away from home to stay in the Kasturba Gandhi Girls School hostel in Ganj Muradabad. Before she got admission there, it was difficult to afford even her daily bus fare of Rs 30. Those who used to taunt me are congratulating me these days,” Savitri said.
Savitri and her elder son Rohit stay in a one-room thatched-roof house. They will stream the final on the first smartphone in the family, gifted by Archana before she left for the World Cup.
Then again, Savitri won’t be the only parent watching the final in anticipation of an India win.

Captain Shafali Verma, now 19, is a prodigy who made her senior team debut at 15. On the eve of this final, she has taken inspiration from her father’s words. “My daughter will get more chances,” her father Sanjeev had said after the loss to Australia in the 2020 T20 World Cup final.
“My father always made me feel like I was the best and that I had everything. So, thank you papa,” Shafali said at the pre-match press conference Saturday. “All those neighbours who came to stop (her from playing cricket), you shooed them away and made me practice. If I win the trophy tomorrow, it’ll be for my father. If he wouldn’t have backed me, I wouldn’t have been here,” Shafali, a hard-hitting batter, said.

At Raja Ka Taal, 5 km from Firozabad, Guddi Devi never wanted her daughter Sonam Yadav to play cricket. But come Sunday, the entire family, including Sonam’s four sisters and a brother, will follow the final from their home.
Sonam, a 15-year-old left-arm spinner, is the youngest member of the Indian team. Her brother Aman Yadav quit cricket eight years ago and joined the glass factory where his father Mukesh works. “I started working when I turned 18. We needed extra money for the marriage of our sisters. Sonam always had a spark from a very early age. She was a natural athlete. So we wanted her to pursue her dream,” Aman said.
The Under-19 team won all their group games against South Africa, UAE and Scotland by big margins. In the Super Six, however, they suffered a seven-wicket loss to Australia. The team bounced back with a big win against Sri Lanka and outclassed New Zealand in the semifinal by chasing down a target of 108 in 14.2 overs with eight wickets to spare.

England, meanwhile, edged out Australia by three runs in a tense finish in the other semifinal.
India’s first women’s captain Shantha Rangaswamy believes a win Sunday can be the “catalyst” for women’s cricket in the country. “The inaugural U19 World Cup and to be in the finals, it’s the centrestage,” Rangaswamy told The Indian Express. “Indian cricket changed for the better after the 1983 (men’s World Cup) win. Irrespective of the result of tomorrow, it will be a big morale booster for women’s cricket in India.”

"Brave, offensive and risky hockey can only stop Belgium: German coach","After winning a silver in the 2016 Rio Olympics, Belgium went on to win the 2018 World at the same venue here and then clinched gold in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.","Germany head coach Andre Henning on Saturday said his side will have to put up a brave effort and play risky hockey to stop the rampaging run of Belgium in the World Cup summit clash on Sunday.
After winning a silver in the 2016 Rio Olympics, Belgium went on to win the 2018 World at the same venue here and then clinched gold in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.
“We played against them in Pro League in Argentina, one win and one loss. Played them here and it was a draw. Seems to be very close on an eye level. My biggest respect for Belgium with what they have achieved in the last few years. They are clearly the best team in the world at the moment,” Henning said at the pre-final press conference.
“So, it will be a tough match, we will have to challenge them. All of their players are world class but we will focus on our strength and qualities.” Henning feels Belgium don’t have any weakness.
“It does not seem that they are vulnerable at the moment, weak or disadvantaged. They are still very strong. But we want to challenge them, how long that go (on dominating). We will like to stop that, in a most respectful way.
“We have to be brave, offensive and play risky hockey as well. We have to bring all our qualities on the pitch. Then only we will be able to challenge a team like Belgium.” Henning said his team will try to repeat their strong semifinal performance against Australia, whom they had beaten 4-3, to challenge the defending champions on Sunday.
“Against England (in quarterfinals) we did not play our best hockey for 55 minutes, but that was because of England mostly, they defended extremely well and they had an amazing tournament. Luckily, we played our best hockey in the last five minutes,” he said.

“The match against Australia was a little bit different, because we played extremely well and strong. It was a well deserved win. We defended well, had a lot of chances. We would aim to perform like that tomorrow. We will have a chance.
“Our high press was really good against Australia. We have to be good in the first line and our forwards are working a lot, running metres are amazing against Australia. Running wise one of the best games ever since we have GPS running data.” Germany came back twice in the tournament from two-goal down to force a win against England and Australia but Henning said it was not an ideal situation.
“I would prefer to be not a goal down two minutes before the end of match. So, there is something to improve,” the coach said.
“We have done very well in defending in our zone, that is very strong and we have improved on that. That is something we want to do, to be kind of typical German tournament team and take steps game by game.” Asked if his team would like to keep the ball against Belgium on Sunday, Henning said defending and counter-attacking will be the main focus.

“Hockey is now about defending, counter-attacking and the game is getting faster and faster. We have a lot of rapid players, our counter attacks are very strong.
“Germany traditionally is or was a team which like to have ball possession and we will not change this culture 100 per cent. It has to be a good mixture. So we will like to have the possession and good build up but our defending has a massive focus this year and also counter attacking.” Belgium head coach Michel van den Heuvel said his team will have to guard against Germany’s ability to have a strong finishing.
“We have been playing them a couple of times last couple of months and they have grown game by game. As a natural character, Germany is able to finish well. We had a saying in the past that we always win against German when they are in the bus.
“We also have a strong group which can handle pressure. It will be an interesting clash between two fantastic teams and fantastic individuals. It will be a good advertisement of hockey.” Belgium captain Felix Denayer said the success of the side was due to the effort of the team, the support staff and togetherness of the group for a long time.

Mithali roped in as WPL side Gujarat Giants’ mentor,"Mithali, the highest run-getter in women's international cricket, had retired last year from all formats after a 23-year-long career.","Former India cricket captain Mithali Raj has been roped in as mentor and advisor by Women’s Premier League (WPL) side Gujarat Giants ahead of the inaugural season, which will take place in March-April this year.
Mithali, the highest run-getter in women’s international cricket, had retired last year from all formats after a 23-year-long career.
As mentor of the side, the 40-year-old cricketer will also promote women’s cricket and help develop the sport at the grassroots level in Gujarat.
The Ahmedabad franchise had emerged the costliest of the five teams during the auction recently, with Adani Sportsline shelling out Rs 1289 crore.
Mithali said the new BCCI initiative will help women’s cricket grow steadily and encourage young players to take up cricket professionally.
“The inaugural season of the Women’s Premier League is a fantastic move for women’s cricket and the involvement of the Adani Group is a massive boost for the sport as well,” said Mithali on Saturday.
“Women’s cricket is growing steadily, and this kind of impetus will undoubtedly encourage young women to consider taking up cricket professionally.

“I believe that the high-impact participation of corporates will help hasten the process of eventually bringing more glory to India.
“This level of influence can help strengthen the sporting ecosystem and enhance opportunities for women athletes,” she added.
Adani Enterprises director Pranav Adani called Mithali a role model and hoped her presence will help attract new talent in not just cricket but other sports as well.
“Mithali Raj is a role model for the young generation and we are delighted to have such an inspirational athlete on board to mentor our women’s cricket team,” said Pranav.

Iheanacho goal sends Leicester to FA Cup fifth round,"Leicester, who beat fourth-tier strugglers Gillingham by a single Iheanacho goal last time out, faced a stern test from a hard-working, high-energy Walsall side eager to shut out their top-flight opposition.","Kelechi Iheanacho spared Leicester City from a potential FA Cup giant-killing once again as his second-half goal saw the Foxes beat fourth-tier Walsall 1-0 and progress to the fifth round on Saturday.
Leicester, who beat fourth-tier strugglers Gillingham by a single Iheanacho goal last time out, faced a stern test from a hard-working, high-energy Walsall side eager to shut out their top-flight opposition.
It took 30 minutes for the Foxes to get a shot on target, and a frustrating afternoon was made worse as Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans’ powerful effort from the penalty spot struck the post after Patson Daka was fouled inside the box.
But second-half substitute Iheanacho rescued Leicester’s afternoon when his effort from the edge of the box took a wicked deflection off the back of Walsall defender Brandon Comley, turning it into a curling, dipping ball that proved too much for the goalkeeper to handle.
Fellow Premier League side Leeds United beat lower-division opposition in Saturday’s other early game as they triumphed 3-1 over Accrington Stanley to reach the fifth round for the first time since 2016.

Belarusian Sabalenka crowned first ‘neutral’ Grand Slam champion,The big-hitting Belarusian overhauled Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina 4-6 6-3 6-4 in the final at Rod Laver Arena on Saturday while barred from representing the eastern European nation.,"With daring, resolve and a thunderous forehand, Aryna Sabalenka rose above geopolitical tumult to become the first player to claim a Grand Slam title as a neutral at the Australian Open.
The big-hitting Belarusian overhauled Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina 4-6 6-3 6-4 in the final at Rod Laver Arena on Saturday while barred from representing the eastern European nation.
Russian and Belarusian players are effectively “stateless” on the ATP and WTA tours, competing as individuals without national affiliation due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Had Rybakina not switched allegiance to Kazakhstan in 2018, the Russia-born player would also have competed as a neutral.
Perhaps for the first time ever at Rod Laver Arena, the championship match was played without fans waving the national flag of the winner in the terraces.
Deemed a disruption by organisers, fans were banned from bringing Russian and Belarusian flags to Melbourne Park on the second day of the tournament after a complaint from the Ukraine embassy in Australia.
Sabalenka will not have “Belarus” next to her name on the winner’s trophy, the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup.
ADVERTISEMENT
They may have seemed mere details as the 24-year-old joyously celebrated with her team in the players’ box and sipped on a glass of champagne at her post-match media conference.
But her mood darkened slightly when asked whether being a neutral player had taken something away from her triumph.
“I think everyone still knows that I’m Belarusian player. That’s it,” she told reporters flatly.
Sabalenka and other Belarusian and Russian players were banned from Wimbledon last year, a polarising decision that triggered heavy fines from the men’s ATP and women’s WTA tours and also saw the Grand Slam’s ranking points taken away.
ADVERTISEMENT
With the conflict in Ukraine raging on, Wimbledon will soon need to decide whether the player ban should remain in place.
Asked whether missing Wimbledon made her Australian Open win sweeter, Sabalenka was non-committal.
“I mean, missing the Wimbledon was really tough for me. It was a tough moment for me,” she said.
“But I mean, I played the U.S. Open after. It’s not about Wimbledon right now. It’s just about the hard work I’ve done.”
The Belarus tennis federation was quick to extend congratulations to the country’s second tennis player to win a Grand Slam, following on from twice Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka, who was knocked out in the semi-finals.

Rybakina to enter top 10 but says career boost won’t change her,"Rybakina, who switched allegiance to Kazakhstan in 2018, was beaten 4-6 6-3 6-4 by Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka in the Melbourne Park final and will rise to number 10 in the world from number 25 when the rankings are updated on Monday.","Elena Rybakina will become the first Kazakh tennis player to enter the top 10 singles world rankings after her run to the Australian Open final on Saturday, making up somewhat for the points she missed out on in her Wimbledon triumph last summer.
But the Russian-born player said the lift would not change her.
“I don’t think tomorrow I’m going to feel different just because of the ranking now,” she told reporters.
Rybakina, who switched allegiance to Kazakhstan in 2018, was beaten 4-6 6-3 6-4 by Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka in the Melbourne Park final and will rise to number 10 in the world from number 25 when the rankings are updated on Monday.
She lost out on 2,000 ranking points after her Wimbledon win because the Grand Slam was stripped of points for banning Russian and Belarusian players over the war in Ukraine. But she shrugged off having to start her Australian Open campaign on an outer court.
“For sure, it’s going to be different in the smaller tournaments I would say. I’m going to be seeded. Maybe in some tournaments I’m not going to play in the first round.
“So of course there are some benefits out of this. But for sure I don’t really look at the numbers or rankings so much.”

Rybakina said reaching a second major final so quickly after her first had eased some of the pressure of expectations.
“Yeah, for sure. Even I would say I’m trying to not think about expectations and everything,” Rybakina said.
“I think in the end it’s just confidence to go forward, to keep on working. Now I have more confidence, even after this final. I just need to work hard, same as I did during pre-season and actually throughout the years, be healthy and for sure the results are going to come.”
Kazakhstan Tennis Federation president Bulat Utemuratov said reaching the final was a feat in itself after Rybakina defeated three Grand Slam champions along the way in Iga Swiatek, Jelena Ostapenko and Victoria Azarenka.

“It’s clear that Elena is feeling increasingly confident on different types of surfaces, intelligently adapting her tactics depending on her opponents, and improving her game,” Utemuratov said in a statement.

Watch: Cristiano Ronaldo’s reaction after fans film him in a restaurant,"As soon as Ronaldo walked into the restaurant surrounded by his bodyguards, everyone in the restaurant took out their phones out and started taking photos or videos.","Al-Nassr superstar Cristiano Ronaldo had a priceless reaction after he was filmed when he went to dine out in a restaurant in Riyadh on Friday. The superstar had gone to the restaurant to celebrate the 29th birthday of his partner Georgina Rodriguez. As soon as Ronaldo walked into the restaurant surrounded by his bodyguards, everyone in the restaurant took out their phones out and started taking photos or videos.
In response, Ronaldo himself took out his mobile and started taking a video of fans filming him, before laughing and walking away.
Ronaldo has not had the desired impact that people would have hoped when he signed with Al Nassr last month with the Portuguese superstar drawing a blank in his second straight game, this time in a Saudi Super Cup match against Al Ittihad. As a result, Al Nassr was knocked out after a 3-1 drubbing and Ronaldo’s wait for silverware continued.
The 37-year-old Portugal international, five-times Ballon d’Or winner, had a couple of chances to score but was well shackled by the Al Ittihad defence for most of the match. However, before the second goal of Al Ittihad went in Ronaldo had a glorious chance to draw Al Nassr level in the tie when he directed a header which was saved by the opposition goalkeeper.
After the match, Al Nassr manager Rudi Garcia put some blame on that gilt-edged chance by Ronaldo as one of the reasons for losing the match. “One of the things that changed the course of the match was Cristiano Ronaldo’s missed opportunity in the first half,” he said.

"Lack of tactical awareness, non-existent club culture behind India’s early exit: Oltmans",India lost the crossover match to New Zealand and failed to make the quarter-finals after going down 4-5 in sudden death.,"Former India men’s hockey head coach Roelant Oltmans has blamed the lack of tactical awareness and a non-existent club culture for India’s early exit in the ongoing edition of the FIH Men’s World Cup.
India lost the crossover match to New Zealand and failed to make the quarter-finals after going down 4-5 in sudden death.
India’s current head coach Graham Reid had also voiced concern about the lack of club culture after the Hockey India League (HIL) became defunct in 2017.
“There is no club culture in India, that is for sure. And the players need to continue playing games, that this team is lacking,” Oltmans, who was at the helm of affairs of the Indian team from 2015 to 2017, told PTI in an interview.
“These Indians are fantastic hockey players, no doubt about that. But you need to know what to do at which moment of the game. If all of a sudden, you are 11 against 10, what are you going to do?” added the Dutchman, who also served as the High Performance Director of Indian hockey from 2013 to 2015.
India were unable to take advantage of the circumstances after New Zealand were reduced to 10 men in the crossover match.
After New Zealand made it 3-3 in the fourth quarter, Nick Ross received a yellow card in the 53rd minute and was suspended for five minutes. New Zealand defended doggedly to take the match into penalty shootout and then sudden death.
ADVERTISEMENT
“India had five minutes before the end of the match when a New Zealand player was out. What were India doing at such a moment? You need to play tactical games, execute them properly,” Oltmans, who was India head coach during the 2016 Rio Olympics, said.
“The Germans scored two goals in three minutes (against England), that is the difference, that is something India still need to work on.” Oltmans was surprised that India did not have a mental-conditioning coach. The Dutchman said that a psychologist was with the team at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) Centre in Bengaluru when he was at the helm.
“Absolutely, it (having a mental-conditioning coach) makes a difference. When I was the head coach prior to the (Rio) Olympics, I had a psychologist in my staff. It is more or less the same as having a mental-conditioning coach.
“For the physical part of the game, we have physical training, for tactical part of the game, we have tactical training, for skill training we have drag-flick trainers. But the mental aspect made a major difference and there we don’t have a serious trainer. That is strange,” said Oltmans.
ADVERTISEMENT
He opined that captain Harmanpreet Singh shouldering too many responsibilities could have affected his performance in the World Cup. Harmanpreet struggled to score with his drag-flick, which is being blamed for India’s early exit.
“In a team, you always know who your leaders are. Harmanpreet has been on the scene since the 2016 Junior World Cup and now we are talking about 2023. Over the years, he has shown that he is an important player,” Oltmans said, explaining how Harmanpreet was given the leadership role.
“He (Harmanpreet) is leading the defence and he is the main penalty-corner taker. We want to give him so much responsibilities at the same time. I am sure he has the qualities to lead the team but having too many responsibilities can affect him, though I know he is a very calm and relaxed player in stressful situations.” Oltmans, who has also coached Pakistan, Malaysia and the Netherlands national teams, said that India must do more to find and groom talented players, an aspect which, he said, the country was lacking as compared to countries like Netherlands.
“You need to develop talent in every aspect of the game. Quite a few players from that junior World Cup-winning Indian side are in this senior World Cup but (that is) not enough.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Players like Dipsan Tirkey, Harjeet Singh were there in that (junior) team. Where have they been; they are gone out of the system. I don’t see them any longer.
“Talent grooming is an important part as you need to prepare the next generation. Of course, not everybody can be included in the national team. But we need to ensure that there is a continuous stream of talent.” The 68-year-old coach, however, warned other countries not to discount India for a 2024 Paris Olympics podium finish.
“They (India) were on the podium in Tokyo, why can’t they be there (in Paris)? There is enough talent in this country. Make proper plans, execute them properly, use right people and you will be there.” He also welcomed the national federation’s plan to revive Hockey India League (HIL).
“Absolutely, HIL will be really beneficial for Indian hockey if it comes back. Not only the senior national team players, the juniors will also benefit. In that period when the HIL was there (till 2017), India won the junior World Cup in 2016 (Lucknow).” Oltmans is not too worried about fewer penalty-corner goals being scored in the last few years.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Normally, PC conversion rate was about one in three and later one in four, that was alright. But, now, it is one in five or one in six, that is too low. We need to improve that again.
“If you are not scoring penalty-corner goals from your drag-flick, then you should change your mindset and see what can we do to score. We may see more goals in the next major tournament.” He said there is no harm in employing the old method of taking direct hits from PCs, rather than going for a drag-flick.

Perth Scorchers overcome Sydney Sixers to secure BBL final berth,The four-time champions restricted the Sixers to 151-8 before replying with 154-3 in 18.3 overs. Skipper Ashton Turner led from the front with a powerful 84 not out from 47 balls.,"The Perth Scorchers managed to blunt an in-form Steve Smith and choke the Sydney Sixers on Saturday, advancing directly to the Big Bash League (BBL) final by way of a seven-wicket victory at home.
The four-time champions restricted the Sixers to 151-8 before replying with 154-3 in 18.3 overs. Skipper Ashton Turner led from the front with a powerful 84 not out from 47 balls.
Sydney Sixers must now win a knockout final on Thursday against one of Brisbane Heat or Melbourne Renegades to keep their chances of playing in the Feb. 4 decider alive.
The Scorchers opened their run chase in disastrous fashion, reduced to 22-3 after Sixers’ seamer Sean Abbott (3-25) repeatedly induced catching opportunities.
Turner and opener Cameron Bancroft then partnered sensibly in the middle overs, regularly working singles and judiciously looking for boundaries.
But they did take some risks, and Bancroft (53 not out) survived one bizarre scare when he skied a ball which neither the keeper nor point fielder chased after, both expecting the other to move into position.
Turner accelerated towards the end of the chase, bludgeoning nine fours and a six as he scripted a victory which delighted the strong crowd of 41,116.
ADVERTISEMENT
The reigning champions have continued their domination this season with 12 wins from 15 matches despite the unavailability of many first-choice players.
All-rounders Mitchell Marsh and Cameron Green sustained injuries prior to the tournament, fast bowlers Jhye Richardson and Matthew Kelly were recently sidelined, and spinner Ashton Agar is preparing for Australia’s test tour of India.
Earlier, the Sixers had a shaky start themselves when pacer Jason Behrendorff (2-17) delivered two wickets in the first three overs.
Kurtis Patterson departed for six courtesy of a spectacular one-handed catch at mid-on by Aaron Hardie, who spilt a simple chance soon afterwards to give 33-year-old opener Smith a life on 12.

Smith has been on a scintillating run of form, including back-to-back centuries, since joining the BBL after his international obligations.

Australia should have separate coaches for Test and white-ball like England: O’Keefe,Andrew McDonald is currently Australia's all-format coach after he replaced Justin Langer last year ahead of the series against Pakistan.,"Ahead of Australia’s Test and ODI tour of India, former spinner Steve O’Keefe has raised the pitch for separate coaches for different formats, saying that it would help reduce the pressure on one individual.
Andrew McDonald is currently Australia’s all-format coach after he replaced Justin Langer last year ahead of the series against Pakistan.
O’Keefe, who played nine Tests and seven T20Is, felt if the two-coach model could work for England, there was no reason why it won’t work for Australia.
England, after splitting the Test and white-ball coaching setup, have done remarkably well.
The Test team under coach Brendon McCullum has won nine out of 10 Tests, while under Matthew Mott, England won the T20 World Cup in Australia last year.
With Australia set for a busy year that includes the Border-Gavaskar series, Ashes and the ODI World Cup in India, among other assignments, O’Keefe feels the time is right to get separate head coaches.
“I think following an England model would work… it’s a lot of pressure on coaches to travel, they’re away 300 days of the year sometimes,” the former Australia spinner told SEN Radio on Saturday.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The Aussie team has got India and England coming up, that takes a lot out of you and I think having a pool of coaches that you can go to for white ball, T20 and one-day cricket would ease that burden.
O’Keefe opined that separate coaches was the need of the hour as cricket in the different formats had evolved differently.
“They are, now in particular, starkly different games. I’m not taking anything away from Andrew McDonald; he’s a fantastic coach, but I think in the future if we had a white-ball and a red-ball coach that would be the way forward.” The former player added that he had a feeling the change will take place soon.
“My gut feel says that will happen at some stage.” Recently, Australian Cricketers’ Association (ACA) CEO Todd Greenberg had expressed concern over the increasing workload of players, saying it was getting difficult for them to play all three formats.

“That’s getting harder and harder, and it’s getting harder and harder… to play three formats of the game,” Greenberg had said in December.

Vinicius Jr enjoys warm welcome in Morocco after pain in Spain,"Vinicius was the star attraction for the Moroccan fans, who created a noisy atmosphere at the sold-out Prince Moulay Abdallah stadium in Rabat.","After weeks of being of relentlessly fouled by opponents and racially abused by rival fans in Spain, Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr enjoyed a warm welcome in Morocco as he steered his team to a 4-1 win over Egypt’s Al Ahly on Wednesday to reach the Club World Cup final.
Vinicius was the star attraction for the Moroccan fans, who created a noisy atmosphere at the sold-out Prince Moulay Abdallah stadium in Rabat.
Real would have been forgiven for thinking they were playing at home, given the raucous backing of the vast majority of the crowd, who turned up the volume and displayed a giant banner in support of the Spanish giants.
It was Vinicius who got them on their feet every time he touched the ball, and the stadium erupted when he gave Real the lead just on halftime.
The Brazilian also won a penalty, made 13 dribble attempts, was named man-of-the-match and was only fouled twice.
It all felt in stark contrast to when Real play away from their Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Spain, with Vinicius regularly targeted by opposing players on the pitch and subjected to hostility and racist abuse from some fans off it.
On Sunday he was fouled 10 times at Mallorca, the most endured by any player in LaLiga this season.
ADVERTISEMENT
Having suffered 79 fouls so far this campaign, Vinicius is the most fouled player in Europe’s top seven leagues by a big margin, followed by his countryman Neymar at Paris St Germain with 59.
The Mallorca fans were also filmed racially abusing Vinicius during their surprise 1-0 win, the latest incident of racism targeting the Brazilian.
Spanish police are investigating a possible hate crime after a mannequin wearing his No. 20 shirt was hung from a bridge in front of the club’s training ground ahead of the Madrid derby two weeks ago, while in September a panelist on a Spanish soccer show compared his goal celebrations to that of a monkey.
In Morocco, he was substituted in added time and left the field on the opposite side of the pitch to Real Madrid’s bench.
ADVERTISEMENT
A lengthy walk back to the dugout could have been a problematic experience for him in many stadiums in Spain, yet he revelled in it on Wednesday, flashing a big smile and waving back to supporters.
“Vinicius likes to play football, it doesn’t matter where he plays, he enjoys it and wants to do it as well as possible,” manager Carlo Ancelotti told a news conference on Wednesday, when asked if Vinicius was more comfortable playing outside Spain.
“He played a complete game, was always dangerous and scored a fantastic goal. It’s the Vinicius that we all see most of the time.”
Vinicius’s treatment has shone a spotlight on the issue of racism in Spain.
On Tuesday another Brazilian, basketball player Yago dos Santos, endured racist abuse from fans in a competitive match in Catalonia.
ADVERTISEMENT
His team, Ratiopharm Ulm, were beaten by Spanish team Joventut Badalona in the 7Days EuroCup, but the game was marred by racial slurs caught on camera directed to Dos Santos.
The broadcast images showed a women calling the 23-year-old a monkey followed by laughter from another woman by her side.

Everton manager Dyche aiming to add to Liverpool’s woes,"As one of English soccer's ultimate disrupters, Everton's new manager can upset the odds in Monday's Merseyside derby and heap more misery on Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp.","Fresh from bringing Arsenal down to earth, Sean Dyche now has Liverpool in his sights and the chance to make himself an immediate icon among Everton fans.
As one of English soccer’s ultimate disrupters, Everton’s new manager can upset the odds in Monday’s Merseyside derby and heap more misery on Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp.
While Dyche has taken over a team in a fight for Premier League survival, Liverpool has troubles of its own.
“I have no words for it really. I’m sorry,” Klopp said after a 3-0 loss at Wolverhampton last week that left the team in 10th place.
It’s now becoming a case of damage limitation for a team that challenged for an unprecedented four trophies last season, with Champions League qualification looking increasingly unlikely unless Liverpool goes on to win the competition this year.
Such problems must sound like the stuff of dreams for an Everton team that had not won in the league since Oct. 22 before Dyche ended that run in his first game last week against leader Arsenal. Even after that morale-boosting result, the team remains in the relegation zone and only three points above last-place Southampton.
In normal circumstances, a trip to Anfield might be considered the worst possible prospect — Everton has only won one of the last 27 derbies against its biggest rival. Dyche, however, has a history of upsetting the favorites, including a 1-0 win for Burnley at then-champion Liverpool in 2021.
ADVERTISEMENT
This is also not the same Liverpool that has dominated the Premier League — along with Manchester City — over the past four years. The loss at Wolverhampton was the seventh in the league this season and 10th in all competitions.
Nottingham Forest, Leeds, Brentford and Brighton have all beaten Klopp’s once formidable team, which has only won one game this year.
Klopp is struggling to cope after a host of injuries to key players, as well as the loss of forward Sadio Mane last year. His team is in transition and it is uncertain if he will be able to rebuild it to the point that he can continue to challenge City for major honors.
Dyche, conversely, has the stage set to capitalize and fuel belief among Everton fans that he can lead the club to safety.
ADVERTISEMENT
Back-to-back games against Arsenal and Liverpool represented a daunting start for the new manager, while also explaining why Everton decided to fire Frank Lampard before that run. The club needed the energy and bounce that a change at the top can bring and that was evident against Arsenal.
If Dyche can avoid losing on Monday, he would consider three of the next four games to be winnable against Leeds and Aston Villa at home and at Nottingham Forest. There is also a trip to Arsenal coming.
While points are vital to Everton, so is the message that a win against Liverpool would send out.
As the red half of Merseyside has flourished in recent years, the blue half has sunk to the point that Everton’s very place in the top division of English soccer is in jeopardy.

IND vs AUS: Nagpur pitch “tricked” us: Handscomb,Ravindra Jadeja (5/47) and Ravichandran Ashwin (3/42) shared eight wickets between them as Australia were bowled out for 177 in their first innings. Many Australian batters were out playing poor shots. Some of them played for the turn when there was none.,"Australia batter Peter Handscomb on Thursday admitted that the Nagpur track “tricked” the visiting side as it did a lot less than what they had feared in the opening Test of the four-match series.
Ravindra Jadeja (5/47) and Ravichandran Ashwin (3/42) shared eight wickets between them as Australia were bowled out for 177 in their first innings. Many Australian batters were out playing poor shots. Some of them played for the turn when there was none.
India reached 77 for 1 at stumps on the opening day.
“It definitely wasn’t easy out there. It’s tough because when the pitch is playing tricks that starts to play with your mind a little bit as well,” Handscomb said at the press conference after the opening day’s play.
“The ball that doesn’t do as much you expect to do a little bit more and that’s where you can come undone with the ball that goes straight on, rather than the big turners we saw out there as well.” Handscomb, who scored 31 in the Australian innings, said the Indian team bowled really well as a unit and didn’t give away easy runs.
“It’s tough out there, Jadeja was obviously bowling very well, not really giving our batsmen a lot to hit and I found him tough to score (against),” the 31-year-old right- handed batter said.
For Handscomb, it was a comeback to the Test team after four years and he said he was feeling nice to play again in the longest format.
“I’ve worked really hard on a lot of things on my game, mentally, tactically and on my technique as well.

IND vs AUS: Cream Ravindra Jadeja was spotted applying was just ‘ointment for callused finger’,"IND vs AUS: Tim Paine called it “interesting”, Vaughan questioned it and source in the know says it was for his callus finger and its allowed in ICC's playing conditions  ","India vs Australia: As visuals of Ravindra Jadeja applying some solution on his left index finger on the opening day of the first Test against Australia surfaced on social media, former Australia captain Tim Paine called it “interesting” leading to debates on Australian media as to what the Indian spinner was doing. However, putting all theories to rest, sources in the know told The Indian Express that Jadeja was just applying an “ointment for callus finger”.
Although the visuals raised eye-brows, sources in the know revealed that it is common practice and it is allowed in ICC’s playing conditions.

The 34-year-old all-rounder, who was also the leading wicket taker the last time Australia played a Test series in India, spilled the beans on his comeback to international cricket following an injury bout.
“Playing after 5 months, playing Test cricket, it’s tough,” Jadeja said on stumps at day one. “I was prepared for it and I was working hard on my fitness as well as on my skills at NCA. I played a first-class game (Ranji) after a long time and I bowled almost 42 overs. It gave me a lot of confidence to come here and play a Test match.”

Jadeja further added that during his rehab, he would bowl for insane hours while he was at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore to be Test match fit.
“I was working hard on my bowling when I was in Bangalore at the NCA. I was bowling 10-12 hours everyday and that helped me a lot. I was working on my rhythm because I knew that I have to play Test match and I have to bowl long spells,” he said.
The left arm orthodox further spoke of the wicket at VCA Nagpur that had been a persistent topic of discussion in the buildup to the first India-Australia Test.
“There was no bounce on the wicket, I was targeting the stump-to-stump line. The odd ball was spinning and the odd ball was going straight. Being a left-arm spinner, if you get batsmen out caught behind or stumped, you always give credit to the ball. In Test match cricket, whatever wicket you take, you are happy with that,” Jadeja said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-was-bowling-10-12-hours-everyday-at-the-nca-ravindra-jadeja-on-comeback-five-for-in-first-test-vs-australia-8434666/,sports

His teammates would ruffle and pull the hair, but Jadeja would simply keep laughing at the frivolity around him, as he walked back in glee to the dressing room holding aloft the ragged red ball of love on his comeback to international cricket.
The dry, post-noon air of Nagpur might have felt sweet for him after all the doubts that hung over his fitness and readiness to play Test cricket in the build-up to the series, after all the hot air of criticism blown his way during his injury-rehab days that he was keener on campaigning for his wife in Gujarat polls and meeting the Prime Minister rather than focussing on recovery, all the trolls and vitriol after the CSK drama. Jadeja has seen and heard all these, ridicule of viler nature, parody of cruder tones, but rather than shrinking into a shell of doubts and fears, he has only channelled more courage and inspiration from adversities with an innate nonchalance often misconstrued as arrogance.
There could be no more tenacious a cricketer, for all his flash and flamboyance afar the field, than Jadeja in modern cricket, from his humble upbringing in Jamnagar to his troubled cricketing years to his steady evolution as one of the country’s finest-ever cross-format all-rounders. Not just a master of comebacks, but a master of evolutions too.

His eleventh five-wicket haul marked another step of evolution in his Test career—from a third-fourth innings hangman he has metamorphosed into an every-innings executioner; from a ruthless destroyer on crumbling surfaces to a peerless any-surface devastator. Of his 247 Test wickets only 56 have arrived in the first innings of a Test, a phase wherein he has also bowled the fewest overs (585.5 off 2480.3 overs), which reveals how captains have used him as well. That only once before has he grabbed a five-for in the first innings—against Australia in Ranchi—nails the point. But that effort took 49.3 overs and arrived late on the second day. Nagpur was the first time he had ever picked a five-wicket haul on the first day, four coming in an engrossing, potentially match-defining second session, which Australia began on 76 for 2 and ended at 174 for eight.
The deck might not have been a classical day one subcontinent one; the bounce was cruelly low, the turn was turgidly slow, the stray ball leapt off length, but still this was far from a characteristic Jadeja-wreck wicket. Perhaps more instructively, he bargained most of his wickets with his infinitely-evolving craft and ever-growing wisdom than from any assistance off the surface. All spinners coaxed varying degrees of assistance from the pitch, but only Jadeja discovered the perfect length, only he possessed the persistence and consistency to alter the length, which he did with devastating subtlety. All of his colleagues had the tools on this surface, but only he alone knew how and when to use those.
Jadeja is not a moments bowler, not a highlight-reel one, but one that you should watch the entire spell to fully grasp the art and nuance. For instance, the Steve Smith dismissal. Throughout the spell, he kept chipping away on little aspects, never letting him bed down. Just when Smith assumed he had a measure of him, Jadeja would sow doubts in his mind with a surprise change of length or angle or pace, or release positions by manoeuvring the depth of the crease. He would later explain his method, with characteristic minimalism: “I preferred bowling stump to stump, because on a low bounce track, there are more chances of leg before and bowled and luckily, I got a few lbws and bowled, so that makes me happy.” But his method was not as simple as he made it sound.

There was also the keenness, often exuberance too: “ I loved the rhythm with which I bowled and the ball came out of my hand quite well.” A typical bowler thing to say, but when you are coming back, after five doubt-ridden months, all those little things matter.
In the first session, he had stroked a brace of gorgeous fours, one a back-foot punch of a short-of-length ball and the other a golf-club whip over midwicket, but later in the spell, he beat with a ball that drifted in and spun sharply past the bat, before a straighter one, perhaps a natural variation whirred past his off-stump. But in the second session, Smith was wary of his threat and hence looking to avert danger rather than attack him to submission. Maybe it was the Marnus Labuschagne dismissal that was haunting him. Batsmen could sense if a bowler is in an inspirational mood.
It did not help that the first ball he faced from Jadeja whirled in and spun past his outstretched bat. Smith blew his cheeks. This session, Jadeja was slower through the air. A no-ball and a full ball followed. The next one—a but similar to the first in length—took his edge that reached the first slip on three-bounce. Then pounced the wicket ball—again of similar pace, but a few centimetres shorter in length. Smith first misjudged the flight, then the direction of the turn.

Usually when Jadeja turns the ball back, the shoulder-snap is quicker, the ball is brisker, like the crack of doom. So Smith presumed that the ball would either hold its line or spin away. So he thrust his bat, for even if he edges the lack of bounce would mean that the ball would not carry to the slip. But to his despair, the ball turned back just adequately to sneak through his bat and pad to hit the stumps. Smith bore the devastated look of a ship-wrecked sailor. The ship he was steering was sinking.
Post lunch, when it all seemed like smooth-sailing, Jadeja emerged from the bed of the ocean to topple the ship. Just five overs ago had he ejected the hitherto sumptuous Labuschagne and Matthew Renshaw off successive balls. Labuschagne, who had earlier flicked him against the turn, was foxed by a change of length. The flight lured him into the lunge, but the ball never arrived, and when it did, it was far from where Australia’s most assured batsman had anticipated. He kept lunging, dragging his back-foot out of the crease, and then watched agonisingly the ball whistling past him for the quick hands of KS Bharat to whip off the bails. Renshaw merely played down the wrong line, as yet again Jadeja made things happen, as he often does, but seldom on the first day. Once the core of Australia’s nucleus disassembled, Australia fell apart, but for Alex Carey’s 36-run counterpunch.
Jadeja would celebrate each wicket with a roar and fist-pump. This was how much each of those five wickets meant for him. Ridiculed, parodied, trolled, and written off, this is when Jadeja channels his tenacity, his drive to prove the world wrong, the narrative arc that defines his career. And at that moment when the sun kissed him on his forehead and the scream of adulation pierced his ears, he might have felt a moment of pure joy.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/trolled-during-injury-rehab-ravindra-jadeja-bounces-back-to-bowl-india-to-a-match-winning-position-against-australia-8434532/,sports
IOC president Bach urges Ukraine to drop Paris boycott threat,The IOC has said a boycott will violate the Olympic Charter and that its inclusion of Russian and Belarusians is based on a U.N. resolution against discrimination within the Olympic movement.,"International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has called on Ukraine to drop threats of a boycott of the 2024 Olympics over the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes.
Ukraine hopes to secure widespread international support for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes after the IOC opened the door for them to compete as neutrals in Paris.
Athletes from Russia and neighbouring Belarus, which aided Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, have been banned from many international competitions since.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the IOC to ban Russia from the Olympics, and Olympic bodies and lawmakers in the Nordic and Baltic regions have backed Ukraine.
In a letter to Ukraine’s National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Vadym Huttsait, seen by Reuters, Bach said claims that allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes back into the Games would promote the invasion were “defamatory”.
The IOC has said a boycott will violate the Olympic Charter and that its inclusion of Russian and Belarusians is based on a U.N. resolution against discrimination within the Olympic movement.
“The participation of neutral athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 has not even been discussed in concrete terms yet,” Bach said.

“Therefore, your letter… to your fellow NOCs, to the International Federations, IOC Members and to future Olympic hosts, pressuring them in an attempt to publicly influence their decision making, has been perceived by the vast majority of them as, at the very least, extremely regrettable.
“It is the responsibility of every NOC… to uphold the fundamental principles of the Olympic Charter.”
The IOC announced last month that athletes from the two countries might be allowed to earn slots for the Olympics through Asian qualifying and compete as neutrals, with no flags or anthems.
Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has said it is inconceivable to have Russian athletes marching as a delegation while “bombs are still raining down on Ukraine”.

“There are no plans for a Russian or Belarusian delegation or the flags of these countries at the Olympic Games Paris 2024,” the IOC said in a separate statement on Thursday.

A future European Super League could have 80 clubs -A22 CEO,"Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus were among 12 clubs to announce a breakaway Super League in April last year.","A future European Super League could include as many as 80 teams, Bernd Reichart, the chief executive of A22 Sports Management, a company formed to sponsor and assist in the creation of a breakaway soccer league, said on Thursday.
In a statement outlining the preliminary results of talks that A22 had with what it said was 50 European clubs and stakeholders of football, the company said change was necessary.
“The vast majority of them share the assessment that the very foundation of European football is under threat, and it is time for change,” A22 said.
“Feedback suggests a European football league that is open, based solely on sporting merit, multidivisional with 60 to 80 clubs and a minimum of 14 guaranteed European matches per club.”
Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus were among 12 clubs to announce a breakaway Super League in April last year. But the move collapsed within 48 hours after an outcry from fans, governments and players forced Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid to pull out.

Malaysian hockey player Hanis Nadiah Onn suspended for racist remark about fans at AR Rahman concert,Hanis Nadiah Onn helped Malaysia win gold medals at the 2015 and 2017 SEA Games and was to play in the upcoming SEA Games in Cambodia,"Malaysian national team player Hanis Nadiah Onn has been suspended by the Malaysian hockey federation for a comment she posted online about a recent concert Indian music composer AR Rahman hosted in the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil. The 26-year-old player helped Malaysia win gold medals at the 2015 and 2017 SEA Games and was to turn out for Malaysia in the upcoming SEA Games in Cambodia, but has now been taken out of the team. Media reports in Malaysia said that she had posted comments about a particular community of fans who attended the ‘Secret of Success: Live in Malaysia 2023’ concert.
The decision was made after an inquiry committee, jointly chaired by National Sports Council (NSC) director general Datuk Ahmad Shapawi Ismail and Malaysian Hockey Confederation (MHC), investigated the charges against Onn.
She had posted an apology on her Instagram account, a day after the incident.
“I Hanis Nadiah Onn, a national hockey player, with humility and responsibility would like to apologise for deliberately posting a comment on Jan 28,” she said in a post on Instagram. “Throughout my 10-year involvement in hockey, I am surrounded by friends from different races who are constantly fighting for Malaysia. I regret my carelessness and again I apologise to those affected,” she said.
“The inquiry committee has come to a conclusion that MHC must not consider Hanis for any international assignments including the Cambodia SEA Games,” read the statement. “MHC will review the decision if Hanis shows positive changes in her behaviour.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/hockey/malaysian-hockey-player-hanis-nadiah-onn-suspended-for-racist-remark-about-fans-at-ar-rahman-concert-8434398/,sports

Kevin Pietersen wants IPL to take leaf out of SA20’s book and make ‘innovative’ rule changes,"Pietersen has emerged as a huge advocate of the changes in that the SA20 has brought about, like allowing each captain the liberty to nominate 13 players to take the field at the toss and select their final XI afterwards are among changes the inaugural South African league offers.","The IPL can take a leaf out of the SA20 playbook by implementing the latest T20 league’s “innovative” rule changes and take the entertainment quotient to another level, says former England captain Kevin Pietersen.
Pietersen has emerged as a huge advocate of the changes in that the SA20 has brought about, like allowing each captain the liberty to nominate 13 players to take the field at the toss and select their final XI afterwards are among changes the inaugural South African league offers.
“I don’t mind the new rules. I think the new rules are very, very good. The toss doesn’t play too much of a role. I like the innovation that SA 20 has brought to the game. I think that’s brilliant,” Pietersen said.
“Offering bonus points is also a great idea. You can see bonus point has played a role here. I mean, you want to change the rules to make it more entertaining for everybody.
“Then why not keep progressing. Keep changing the game. Keep making it more entertaining. And also keep the players on their toes. I think the IPL can also implement this.” The interaction was arranged by Sports18 and Jio Cinema.
Viacom 18, IPL’s digital rights media holders, is beaming the South African league to Indian viewers.
Speaking about England’s ultra-aggressive approach to the game and the success it has brought them, Pietersen said India must also look to play in the same manner.

“It’s the mindset. I think they’ve got a coach that is making sure that they’re not scared of failing. They’re not worried about failure. If you get out there, probably, they don’t care about getting out, they just go out and play without fear of failure.
“I think India should follow it. I think India bats too slowly, despite have the players. They have the players, but still. They must go out there and emulate what England are doing.
“You saw what Australia used to do in cricket all those years ago. People started to match Australia or England, or change the way the shortest form of the game was played. Even Test match cricket…” Pietersen tried his hand in owing a T20 league franchise, but could not succeed owing to a lack of sufficient funds. The batting great, though, has not ruled out owing one in the future.
“I was one of the bidders. Yes, I wanted to buy one of the teams. But then, you wouldn’t have enough money to own the teams…
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s a space that interests me. I don’t know if that’s a possibility. But it interests me yes, yes.” Asked if the sport would be better off without the ODI format, especially bilateral rubbers without context, Pietersen said it is difficult to arrive at a definitive conclusion at the moment.
“We can’t say that cricket would be better off without ODIs, because we’re not there yet. But we may see it in future though the World Cup is such a valuable item, right? “In my career, I was able to win everything, except for the 50 over World Cup. We won the Ashes, we beat India In India, we won the T20 World Cup. Huge.. I mean these are big things that you can achieve in your career. And I never got the 50 over World Cup. So it’s one of those regrets.
“So we’ll see. We’ll see where it is. Will it be good for the game? We don’t know. Will it be bad for the game? We don’t know. We don’t know yet. But can we see it happening? I think we can’t see it happening yet.” Speaking about the shortest format, he said it is here to stay, primarily because of the money involved, besides the entertainment quotient.
“It’s here to stay, there’s too much money in T20s. Now 50-over cricket seems like a very, very long day of cricket. I don’t think you get that entertainment in the 50 over game as much as you get in T20s. Something will need to be looked at.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I also fear for Test cricket. And I’ve said that for a very long time that I worry about Test cricket and worry that instant gratification that all of us want could harm Test cricket.
“(Say, for example) now we’re on an aeroplane and I’m speaking to people in three different planes in three different places, talking about work. So that instant gratification is what is actually, I think, hurting the longer form of the games. I think it’s hurting 50-over cricket in particular. And then I think that the longest form of the game.

IND vs AUS: How Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne thwarted the Indian spinners,"India vs Australia: In some sense, Steve Smith is the most arrogant batsman of the modern era. Not because he thrashes and biffs the ball — many others do it a lot better — but in the way he constantly undermines and teases the bowlers. The drive off the back foot. That last-instant leave.","The secret of how both Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne repelled the Indian spinners in the first session of Nagpur Test lies in their hands. The other factors for sure like: playing late, head over the ball, trying not to lunge or play across, but many good batsmen can do all that. What sets these two apart is the way they use their hands to get bat in angles to get them out of jail even if they have misread the length or in slightly awkward balance.
Consider the last ball of the fifth over. Shami vs Smith. Sensing Smith was stuck on the crease, Shami very smartly hurled that full and also got the ball to tail in very late. For all purposes it seemed to be heading towards the front pad. With most batsmen, after they have found themselves in that position, it would have been difficult to bail out. Perhaps, an ugly uncertain stab can be envisioned.
But Smith didn’t panic. Somehow, incredibly, he got his hands working overtime, got the bat at an angle but got enough wood to squeeze it between the blurring ball and the front pad. The difference between lbw and survival.
In some sense, Smith is the most arrogant batsman of the modern era. Not because he thrashes and biffs the ball — many others do it a lot better — but in the way he constantly undermines and teases the bowlers. The drive off the back foot. That last-instant leave. The casual swipe across the line as if he is flicking dirt off his trousers. The sudden decision to go inside-out to balls that he usually smears through the on side.
Then there was Marnus Labuschagne.
He started off with more circumspection than Smith. As if he wasn’t quite sure what the ball was going to do or not quite picking it off the hand of the spinner – Axar Patel in particular.
But again, no overt panic. He had a method to fall back on. Initially, he didn’t press too far back or lunge forward. Too risky, without reading the ball. Lbw or bat-pad-catch looms with those approaches.
𝑰. 𝑪. 𝒀. 𝑴. 𝑰!

Instead, he just leaned forward a little, without making any big stride, – those wonderful hands again allowed him to get away with it. Combined with the decision to play the ball late.
When Axar Patel squeezed the ball in, Labuschagne’s defense wasn’t impregnable. For starters, he faced Axar more than Smith. But the hands were clocking overtime. Watching the ball ever so closely, Labuschagne would get the bat in unusual angles to keep the ball out.
ADVERTISEMENT
A usually lazy assessment is that both bat similarly identically but not quite. There are some similarities for sure – most of which comes down to the bat-angles and the areas of the field they access for similar balls.
Smith holds his bat up behind him, behind his hips, and from there on, it’s a slightly ungainly thrust. Labuschagne’s bat flow is much smoother. Ashwin too has talked about in the past that both aren’t that similar as it’s made out to be.

The one common element is their hands. Immensely flexible, they are their greatest ally in keeping the threatening balls out. There were many occasions when a slightly more rigid batsman wouldn’t have been able to get out of trouble but these two managed.
Slowly as the session wore on, Smith started to use his feet. Not quite successfully at first, but that didn’t matter. It wasn’t perfection he was looking for but the need to shift pressure back to the spinners. To say that I am not going to be a sitting duck, you have to come harder at me.
ADVERTISEMENT
Labuschagne picked up that theme. He didn’t quite charge out as much as Smith but started taking the front stride out. Soon, also started to press back as the bowlers started to try adjusting to the forward movement by changing their lengths. Now, the pressure was on the spinners.

There was a ball that Jadeja nearly bowled Smith with. It turned ever so slightly even as Smith let his hands and bat stay in the line of off stump. The ball missed the edge by the barest of margin and the off stump too. Both seem to have the ability to put out such deliveries from their mind, and move on quickly.
There was a shot from Marnus in the midst of a neat spell from Axar that said much. Purely on width offered outside off, he leaned back to a full delivery to delicately and deliberately slice-cut it well to the left of backward point. Not at easy to do: the length, the potential to turn, and the risk of outer edge hovering but he went for it.
It’s another trait that both are good with: taking risks. Not the conventional slog-sweeps and such but even in defense, the choices they take. It could be a ball on the off-stump line, but they would collapse their hands to steer the ball to point.
ADVERTISEMENT
Like Mohammad Azharuddin or that wonderful batsman of spin Salim Malik would do. Where others would play the line, Azhar and Malik would manipulate it. More than a trace of that trait can be seen in Smith and Labuschagne.
Couple of years ago, one had met S Sreesanth for a chat on his life out of jail and such. The talk also veered to cricket and suddenly he said something about Smith.
“You are never going to get him lbw, forget it. Never. The best ball is the one leaving him from the off-stump line. Where does he end up despite all that moving about? Off-stump or just outside it, right? So the leg-cutter or a good outswinger that moves away from the line of his body is still the way to do it. Why aren’t they bowling it? That away ball can’t start from outside off as he would not touch it. It has to start in his line, where he thinks about playing before it moves away.”

Why didn’t they bowl the leg-cutter? Perhaps, that’s Smith’s greatest achievement. By doing what he does, he makes the bowler forget the basics.

India vs Australia: Mark Waugh points out what Virat Kohli did wrong when he dropped three catches,IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli dropped Steve Smith when he was batting on six on the first ball of the 16th over,"In Australia’s second innings, Virat Kohli dropped a sitter to reprieve David Warner in the second innings, and R Ashwin couldn’t believe it. This time around, Kohli was “grabbing snatching at the ball” according to Mark Waugh on air. Warner was batting on 1.
In the first innings, Virat Kohli handed Australian batter Steve Smith a massive reprieve on the first ball of the 16th over, when the Australian was batting on six. On a quickish ball from Axar Patel, the former Australian captain went for a drive but instead edged the ball. Kohli, standing in at first slip, couldn’t latch on to it. It was a chance that could prove to be decisive to the fortune of the match. Smith was batting on 19 at lunch, helping Australia stabilise themselves ay 76/2 after they lost two early wickets.
Similarly, in the second session as Peter Handscomb edged one off Jadeja, it deflected off KS Bharat and flew quickly. This time Kohli reacted late, prompting Waugh to note that the former India captain had got his stance wrong once again. “Your legs have to be lot closer to be able to move quickly” Waugh would go on to say.
Former Australian cricketer Mark Waugh, sitting in the commentary box, was at hand to offer his insights into what Kohli had done wrong.
“Kohli was very high-up in his position. Should have stayed down a bit,” he offered. “He should have done a little bit better. Almost as if he wasn’t expecting it.”

As replays showed, the former India captain’s top body was more erect and high-up while his hands were above his knees — a position that makes it difficult to react quickly to a sharp chance.
As experts say, when standing in the slips, it’s easier to go up to adjust to a high catch rather than lunging down to snap one up.
Last year, India’s former fielding coach R Sridhar had given an insight into Kohli’s work in the slip cordon, who he called one of India’s best slip fielders.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Virat Kohli has gone on to become one of India’s better slip fielders purely with practice. He was not a very good slip fielder initially because he was too energetic — he was a bundle of energy. That is Kohli. Not that he is not energetic now. He is still very much there but he is able to know when to be calm and he has channelled his energy better. But I am telling you it’s practice.”

After the Indians dismissed the visitors for 177, thanks to the spin wizardry of Ravindra Jadeja (who took five for 47) and Ravichandran Ashwin (three for 42) it was skipper Rohit who led from the front, getting to his half century off just 66 balls. Thanks to his knock, India were trailing the Aussies by just 100 runs at the end of Day 1.
While Rohit rarely broke into a sweat during his innings, at the other end, fellow opener KL Rahul laboured his way to a 71-ball 20, an innings where he never really looked at ease. Finally, a delivery from Todd Murphy got him to hand back an easy catch to the debutant and end his stint at the crease. Ashwin, sent up the order at No 3, was yet to get on the scoreboard after facing five balls when the day ended.
IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 1, Innings update
So, the Australians have been skittled out for 177 in the first innings of the first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test, thanks to the craft of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin. The former was the most lethal at Nagpur, not just because he ended the innings with five wickets, but also because he took the ones that really mattered the most for the hosts. He picked up the scalps of Marnus Labuschagne (out for 49) and Steve Smith (dismissed for 37), both set batters, who, at one stage, were threatening to take the game away from India’s grasp.
For Jadeja personally, this is more than just about the five wickets. He is making a comeback at Nagpur after having been out of national team since August last year due to a right knee injury which he sustained during the Asia Cup.
There was another brief phase of resistance, where Peter Handscomb (31) and Alex Carey (36) tried to hold the fort. But Ashwin got the better of both of them.
IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 1 Tea update
It took just one session and the magic of Ravindra Jadeja for all of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith’s perseverance to unravel. The Australian duo had managed to pull the visitors back from the brink to take them into lunch at 76 for 2.
Just when Labuschagne was starting to drag Australia into a position of power, Jadeja intervened, getting him out for 49. He lured the batter into his trap, first bowling quicker ones, then a slower one inviting him to drive. Labuschagne could not resist taking the bait. Before he knew it, KS Bharat had whipped off his bails. One ball later, Matt Renshaw was walking back to the hut after Jadeja got him LBW.
He then came for the other set batter, getting Smith bowled as Australia slumped to 109 for 5 having started the session 76 for 2.

Ravichandran Ashwin, not one to be left behind, then came and scalped two wickets of his own. Australia went to the tea break at 178 for 8.
IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 1 Lunch update
After an early wobble at the start of the innings, it took the calm reassuring presence of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith to help see out the first session for the visitors on Day 1 of the first Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Labuschagne was batting on 47 while Smith had made a patient 19 off 74 balls at lunch at Nagpur to help Australia reach 76 for 2.

It took just six overs for spin to be introduced on the first day of the first Test of what promises to be a mouthwatering four-Test series. Ravindra Jadeja was handed the ball on his comeback to the national team after five months of being on the sidelines to a right knee injury. In the three overs they split before that, the Indian pace duo of Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami had made inroads into the Australian top order.
Siraj dismissed Usman Khawaja in the second over itself, an LBW call that was initially given not out, but was overturned by the TV umpire. One over later, Shami sent David Warner’s stump cartwheeling with a peach of a delivery. Australia slumped to 2 for 2 in the third over.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Is Greater Than Any Basketball Record,"Guided by the footsteps of Jackie Robinson and Bill Russell, Abdul-Jabbar pushed forward, stretching the limits of Black athlete identity. He was, among other qualities, brash and bookish, confident and shy, awkward, aggressive, graceful — and sometimes an immense pain to deal with. He could come off as simultaneously square and the smoothest, coolest cat in the room.","By Kurt Streeter
Some athletes live swaddled in their greatness, and that is enough. Others not only master their sport but also expand the possibilities — in competition and away from it — for generations to come. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did just that, including for LeBron James, who has laid claim to the NBA career scoring record that Abdul-Jabbar had held so tight for nearly 39 years.
It is easy to forget now, in today’s digitized world where week-old events are relegated to the historical dustbin, how much of a force Abdul-Jabbar was as a player and cultural bellwether. How, as the civil rights movement heated to a boil in the 1960s and then simmered over the ensuing decade, Abdul-Jabbar, a Black man who had adopted a Muslim name, played under the hot glare of a white American public that strained to accept him or see him as relatable.
It is easy to forget because he helped make it easier for others, like James, to trace his path. That is what will always keep his name among the greats of sport, no matter how many of his records fall.
Guided by the footsteps of Jackie Robinson and Bill Russell, Abdul-Jabbar pushed forward, stretching the limits of Black athlete identity. He was, among other qualities, brash and bookish, confident and shy, awkward, aggressive, graceful — and sometimes an immense pain to deal with. He could come off as simultaneously square and the smoothest, coolest cat in the room.
In other words, he was a complete human being, not just the go-along-to-get-along, one-dimensional Black athlete much of America would have preferred him to be.
James has run with the branding concept that he is “More Than an Athlete.” Fifty-plus years ago, Abdul-Jabbar, basketball’s brightest young star, was already living that ideal.
ADVERTISEMENT
“He is more than a basketball player,” a Milwaukee newspaper columnist wrote during Abdul-Jabbar’s early years as a pro. “He is an intelligent, still maturing man, who realizes some of the individual and collective frailties of human beings, including himself.”
James’ ability to make a cultural impact off the court is the fruit of the trees Abdul-Jabbar planted decades ago.
As a star at the basketball powerhouse UCLA in June 1967, a 20-year-old Abdul-Jabbar was the only collegian with football legend Jim Brown at the Cleveland Summit, a meeting of prominent Black athletes who gathered in support of Muhammad Ali’s refusal to fight in the Vietnam War.
The next year Abdul-Jabbar shunned the Summer Olympics to protest American prejudice. “America is not my home,” he said in a televised interview. “I just live here.”
ADVERTISEMENT
In those days, Harry Edwards, now a University of California, Berkeley, sociology professor emeritus, led a new wave of Black athletes in protests against American racism. Abdul-Jabbar was a vital part of that push. He also converted to Islam to embrace his Black African heritage, and changed his name from Lew Alcindor to Kareem (generous) Abdul (servant of Allah) Jabbar (powerful).
“You have to understand the context,” Edwards told me recently. “We’re still arguing over whether Black lives matter. Well, back then, Black lives absolutely did not matter. In that time, when you said ‘America,’ that was code for ‘white folks.’ So, how do those folks identify with a Black athlete who says I am a Muslim, I believe in Allah, that is what I give my allegiance to? They didn’t, and they let him know.”
Edwards added: “What Kareem did was seen as a betrayal of the American ideal. He risked his life.”
Black athletes still face backlash for standing up to racism, but their voices are more potent, and their sway is mightier now because of Black legends like Ali, Robinson, Russell and Abdul-Jabbar.

You saw their imprint when James wore a T-shirt that said “I Can’t Breathe” for Eric Garner, or a hoodie for Trayvon Martin, or when he joined an NBA work stoppage for Jacob Blake. When right-wing pundits attack James and his peers for protesting, remember that Abdul-Jabbar has been in the hot seat, too.
The message here isn’t “Been there, done that, don’t need to hear it anymore.” No, that’s not it at all.
What I am saying is this: No one rises alone.
In this moment of basketball celebration for James, think about what he shares on the court with the 7-foot-2 center whose record he is taking: a foundation of transcendent, game-changing talent.
ADVERTISEMENT
Nowadays, a younger generation might know Abdul-Jabbar mainly as the sharp-eyed commentator and columnist on the internet — or simply as the guy whose name they had to scroll past in the record books to get to James’. But his revolutionary prowess as a player can never be diminished.
He led UCLA to three national titles in his three years of eligibility, his teams accumulating a scorched-earth record of 88-2. Along the way, the NCAA banned dunking, a move many believe was made to hinder his dominance, and UCLA came to be known as the University of California at Lew Alcindor.
Soon, there he was, dominating the NBA with his lithe quickness and a singular, iconic shot: the sky hook. Athletic beauty incarnate.
The balletic rise from the glistening hardwood; the arm extended high, holding the ball well above the rim; the easy tip of the wrist, as if pouring tea into a cup, while he let the ball fly.
Swish.
ADVERTISEMENT
In his second professional year, he was named the NBA’s MVP — the first of a record six such awards.
That season, he led the fledgling Milwaukee Bucks to the 1971 NBA championship. It would be the first of his six titles, two more than James.
The pressure he was under as a player was immense for most of his career.
He said he faced death threats after boycotting the 1968 Olympics.
ADVERTISEMENT
A phalanx of that era’s reporters, almost all of them white men, failed to understand Abdul-Jabbar and took to pat, easy criticism. He did himself no favors, responding by essentially turning his back, often literally, on many of them.
He also absorbed blow after blow on the court. Fights were frequent then. Sometimes it was too much, and he snapped.
He contained the multitudes, all right. Aggressive frustration included.
As the years passed, Abdul-Jabbar evolved. He grew happier, less strident, more content and more open. His advocacy came to focus on human rights for all who are marginalized.
And ultimately, fans who once held him with disregard began to warm up.
ADVERTISEMENT
James now holds the crown as the league’s greatest scorer. with 38,390 points. Well earned. He remains something to behold at age 38. Still, his Lakers are so disjointed they would need Abdul-Jabbar in his prime to make a serious run at an NBA title this year.
Then again, Abdul-Jabbar at 38 would work. That Abdul-Jabbar, in the 1985 postseason, took his championship series lumps during a Game 1 loss to Boston and then came back as if launched from a Bel-Air springboard.
He ripped off a string of the finest games of his career, grabbing the championship trophy and the finals MVP Award.

IND vs AUS: Why is Mohammad Siraj bowling with wobble-seam a lot at Nagpur Test?,India vs Australia: “He dangles it in and suddenly gets to hold its line. Have to be careful against this bloke.” There have been a few edges already at Nagpur thus far.,"First, a little story, from Marnus Labuschagne’s batting coach Neil D’Costa. Neil D’ Costa remembered the muffled respect in the voice of Marnus Labuschagne Labuschagne, who averages over 60 in Test cricket, when talking about Siraj.
“He dangles it in and suddenly gets to hold its line. Have to be careful against this bloke.” There have been a few edges already at Nagpur thus far.
“With wobbled seam, how much the ball will do neither I know nor the batter. Sometimes it goes straight after pitching other times it can come in sharply. Most of my wickets come through wobbled seam. It is effective for me and I trust it to work for me,” Siraj had said last month.
𝑰. 𝑪. 𝒀. 𝑴. 𝑰!

“Inswing was my natural earlier but then it stopped so I also developed outswing. When I did not have the inswing, I developed the wobbled seam. It took a lot of time to get effective and give me confidence. The more I bowled in the nets, the better I got. In the IPL, I spoke to Dale Steyn as well for outswing which helped me a lot.”
He was encouraged on the 2021 tour of England by the then bowling coach Bharat Arun.
He would not only dangle ‘em in, but start playing havoc with this new fascination – the scrambled-seam ball. Up the slope at Lord’s, it would scramble across, and then cut away from the left-handers. Moeen Ali was the one doing the dangling this time, and as Ravichandran Ashwin would say on his YouTube channel, for some time only two players were in action: Siraj and Rishabh Pant, the wicketkeeper, as “fast off-breaks”, in Ashwin’s phrasing, kept cutting away from the left-hander. “How is he able to use the slope so effectively? Not even one ball pitched on the seam,” Ashwin would wonder.
Mohd Siraj celebrates with teammates the dismissal of Australian batter Usman Khawaja during the 1st cricket test match between India and Australia at Vidharba Cricket Association Stadium, in Nagpur, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023. (PTI)
Arun had prepped him about the scrambled-seam ball to exploit the Lord’s slope and Siraj had run away with it like a kid. An equally-excited Sachin Tendulkar was moved enough to tweet a video explainer about it. Tendulkar first gave a demo of the back-spin Siraj imparts with his fingers running down the seam when he wants the ball to swing away. Then, Tendulkar showed how Siraj cuts his fingers at release for the in-cutter to yank the shape of the ball and send it tilting all scrambled towards the batsmen. The admiration in Tendulkar’s eyes tells a story of its own.
L Balaji, former India bowler who is a bowling coach these days, had told this newspaper about how Siraj gets his front-on bowling style work for him.

“The angle which comes in naturally (from the release point) towards off and middle, those guys I have seen have the greatest success. They make the batsmen play most of the time. Side-on right-handers have the angle that allows batsmen to leave the ball a lot more easily. It’s not too much movement in the air that works in South Africa but there is always help from the pitch for open-chested bowlers – because of their angle, they create an illusion of the ball coming in towards off and middle, and those who can get it to straighten from there do the maximum damage,” Balaji says.

“With open-chested bowlers, even when they just about straighten the ball, batsmen seem to get opened up almost. A lot more than they would to a similar straightener from a side-on bowler. The angle of open-chested bowlers like Bumrah and Siraj makes the ball seem to be coming in and they are committed to play. Then that straightening, or even the ball that doesn’t come in that much, troubles them. They tend to test both the edges of the bat more.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-why-is-mohammad-siraj-bowling-with-wobble-seam-a-lot-at-nagpur-test-border-gavaskar-trophy-8433366/,sports

He has three half-centuries with a top score of 71.""","David Warner has reportedly told teammates he will go rightie in the Test – likely when coming up against India’s two left-arm orthodox spinners in Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, according to Fox sports.
“David Warner is a left-hander. It’s worth mentioning, since he’s been spotted in the nets batting right-handed. He’s reportedly told teammates he will go rightie in the Test – likely when coming up against India’s two left-arm orthodox spinners in Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel,” Fox wrote.
Calling it a staggering ploy, Fox added that Warner “once batted a full season of junior cricket right-handed and played brilliantly.”
Warner’s biggest concern, as per Fox, might not be a left-armer though, with Ravichandwin Ashwin having claimed Warner’s wicket 10 times in just 15 Tests.
The Australian opener’s record in India, Fox said, is tough reading – “an average of 24.25 across 16 innings (eight Tests across the 2013 and 2017 series). He has three half-centuries with a top score of 71.”
Pitch patch pitter patter continues
Fox wrote earlier: “The pitch will play a significant factor in Australia’s selections as a 35-year first looms, while opener David Warner is mulling a shocking switch to potentially bat right-handed in response to the conditions.
Selectively watering parts of the pitch, deploying the roller only in specific areas: India’s methods of curating the Nagpur pitch have raised plenty of eyebrows in recent days. It appears to be a clear ploy to give bowlers an advantage against left-handed batters – with five of Australia’s top seven lefties, compared to just one Indian batter.”
While some labelled it “straight-up pitch doctoring”, India great Ravi Shastri hit out at claims his nation was ‘cheating’ by declaring “That’s bulls**t.

Australian cricket journalist Peter Lalor told SEN radio today: “Even in 2004, the wickets weren’t as extreme as they are these days.
“India seems more determined every tour to make wickets that are going to make the Aussies uncomfortable, or any visitor uncomfortable.
“I’ve got to say, I’ve never seen a pitch preparation like what they’ve done here in Nagpur.”
But Australia captain Pat Cummins has tried to downplay the drama, saying the team is ‘embracing the chaos.’

“That’s part of the challenge of playing away. Home teams want to win at home. In Australia, we’re lucky we’ve normally got pace and bounce. Home match advantage, I don’t think it’s a terrible thing. It’s another challenge and makes touring over here even harder when you know the conditions are custom-made for them.”

‘We’re probably the most well-rounded squad to tour India’: Nathan Lyon,"Steve Smith was heard encouraging a net bowler with a ""shabaash"" and David Warner turned down an extra round of throwdowns with ""nahi, nahi"", according to the website.","Experience and learning from past mistakes of previous tours, a more chilled vibe, calmer captain and a well-rounded, flexible squad could be the difference from all earlier times when Australians toured India.
“We’re probably the most well-rounded squad to tour India,” Lyon was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au, on the eve of the first Test at Nagpur. “I’m probably more confident now than what I was in the past. We’ve played a lot of cricket together … we’re a really well-balanced team and we know what we want to set out to achieve,” he added of his third Test tour. “He reckons it is their best chance of claiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy abroad, something they have done just once in 54 years,” cricket.com.au wrote.
Familiarizing themselves with the “rhythm of the subcontinent” happened at low-key Alur where a smattering of Hindi was heard. “In some ways it’s been a low-key preparation,” Cummins told cricket.com.au. “It means we’ve hit plenty of balls, we’ve done all the work, so once the game starts we’re ready. But we also haven’t spent all our energy before that.”
So, Usman Khawaja told a local net bowler in Hindi, with a Queensland twang, to bowl four straight balls to him (“Aur char ball seedha aap hi daalna”) and that he is bowling well (“Bahut achhe daal Rahe ho”, as per cricket.com.au. Khawaja would brush off a visa delay to a “country he has been to 11 times without playing a Test.”
Steve Smith was heard encouraging a net bowler with a “shabaash” and David Warner turned down an extra round of throwdowns with “nahi, nahi”, according to the website.
“We’re definitely more learned,” Khawaja was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. “We’ve made so many mistakes in the past and at some level you learn from them. It doesn’t guarantee success but there’s definitely a different way of thinking. I remember we went to Sri Lanka a while back (in 2016), we struggled there. And even going back on that (last) Indian tour (in 2017), our game plan kind of changed from game to game.
“We’re a more mature side and realise that sometimes you can do all the right things but lose the game. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t do the same thing again the next game. Our batters are more mature, our bowlers are more mature, I think our coaching staff is pretty mature too. I think that helps.”
Big score needs to be really big
ADVERTISEMENT
Steve Smith was captain in 2017 and his takeaway from previous losses stems from ruefully recalling how his side failed to capitalise on winning the first Test in Pune. What haunts him as per the website was Ranchi, “where the Aussies posted a seemingly strong total of 451 in the first innings. India declared on 9-601 and the tourists were forced to hold on grimly to avoid an innings defeat. It was a similar story for the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle last year when Australia’s first-innings 364 left them nearly 200 runs in deficit after the hosts then showed how true the pitch still was. If presented with another typical subcontinental track that initially favours batters and then takes turn later in the Test, Smith knows their sights need to be set higher.”
“If the wickets are good, I think it’s important to make really big scores,” he was quoted as saying. “I always think back to our Test match at Ranchi, we got 450 in the first innings and it wasn’t nearly enough. If the wickets are good, we’re going to have to make 550-plus to get ourselves in the game.”
Cummins on his third tour to Asia as captain, has learnt it’s more complicated than rotating quicks. “Here sometimes you’ve got to wait for the conditions to come to you. If it’s flat on the first two days, but you know the back-end of the game it may break up, it’s as much about holding on, trying to keep control of the game those first few days. So it’s slightly different fields, putting some deeper men back.
“On the flipside, the game can happen really quickly. Batting, you’ve got to have a plan from ball one. And in the field, it’s about trying to stay in that zone when it is happening really fast, and create different options.

It’s fun. It’s different a lot of the time to what you get used to growing up playing in Australia.”
“Confidence in own identity”
According to cricket.Com.au, Australia’s greatest asset might just be the confidence they have in their own identity. “There was some merit in then-coach Justin Langer’s lament during the 2018-19 summer that “we’d be (seen as) the worst blokes in the world” if his side had mimicked Virat Kohli’s on-field antagonism. While this current iteration of the Australian team is less concerned with that side of the game than previous ones, they are perhaps more comfortable in pushing back than when they walked the post-Sandpaper gate tightrope.”
“I’m sure there’s going to be little heated moments on the field,” Cummins was quoted as saying. “It’s two passionate teams playing against each other. But I hope, like we’ve shown over the last little bit, that we can manage our way through that.
“If there is a bit of spice and someone’s getting themselves pumped up, maybe that’s for that purpose, to get themselves into the contest at that moment.

Lionel Messi will go back to Barcelona if president Joan Laporta is kicked out: Argentine superstar’s brother’s bizarre rant,Matias also claimed in the clip that Messi was the one who had put Barcelona on the map and without him the club would be nothing.,"Lionel Messi’s brother Matias on Wednesday courted controversy when he said that the Argentinian superstar will only return to Barcelona if current club president Joan Laporta is kicked out.
“I have a SPORT cutting that says “Messi should return to Barcelona” and I’ve put underneath it “Hahaha”. We are not going back to Barcelona, and if we do, we are going to have a good clearout, kicking-out, among others, Joan Laporta who is ungrateful after all that Messi did for Barcelona,” he can be heard saying in a now viral clip.
“People (in Barcelona) did not support him. People should have gone out to do a march or something, let Laporta leave and Messi stay. The Spanish are traitors. I tell you because I want it to come out of our guts and not listen to things that are not true,” he added.

Messi had to leave Barcelona as a free agent in 2021 to join Paris Saint Germain after spending two decades at the Camp Nou. Laporta had promised that Barcelona would be able to retain Messi but financial situation resulted in the superstar leaving after a very emotional press conference.
Matias also claimed in the clip that Messi was the one who had put Barcelona on the map and without him the club would be nothing.
“(I think) Barcelona became known thanks to Messi. Nobody knew about them before. Whoever’s had the chance to go to Barcelona and see the museum, you can see that the museum is Messi,” he said as quoted by Football Espana.
Messi recently starred with a goal as Paris Saint Germain defeated 12th placed Toulouse and extend their lead on top of the Ligue One table.

Elina Svitolina calls for Russians to be banned from Olympics,"""It's going to be very sad, and the wrong message would be sent to the world if Olympics going to stay with the decision to put them (Russia and Belarus) under a neutral flag,"" Svitolina said in the interview.","Ukrainian tennis player and Olympic bronze medalist Elina Svitolina pushed for a total ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Games in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday.
Svitolina, who won her bronze medal in singles at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, is visiting Ukraine for the first time since Russia invaded the country last year. She is the latest to call for a complete ban on athletes from Russia and Belarus because of the war.
“It’s going to be very sad, and the wrong message would be sent to the world if Olympics going to stay with the decision to put them (Russia and Belarus) under a neutral flag,” Svitolina said in the interview.
“I don’t think this is the right decision.” Svitolina, who had a baby with husband Gael Monfils in October, said sports and politics in Russia are inseparable.
“You can see that in Russia, sports are connected to the government,” Svitolina said.
On Friday, Ukraine’s sports minister renewed a threat to boycott the Paris Olympics if Russia and Belarus are allowed to compete and said Kyiv would lobby other nations to join.
A Ukrainian Olympic Committee meeting did not commit to a boycott but approved plans to try to persuade international sports officials in the next two months — including a discussion of a possible boycott. The leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania also urged the International Olympic Committee to ban Russia and said a boycott was a possibility.

Speakers at the Ukrainian Olympic Committee’s meeting raised concerns about Russia using the Paris Games for propaganda and noted the close ties between some athletes and the Russian military.
“Boycott would be one of the options because obviously what Russian army is doing to Ukrainian people, to Ukraine, it’s a horrible thing for us,” Svitolina said.
“I cannot imagine going to the Olympics like nothing is happening to Ukraine.” Svitolina said the decision to boycott should be discussed with the country’s Olympic committee with input from every Ukrainian athlete involved. She, however, didn’t hesitate to say what she thought was the right thing to do.
“Our men and women are at the front line right now fighting Russian soldiers and dying for our country and for our freedom as well,” Svitolina said.

“And I’m very firm with my decision that boycotting is the right way to do it.” After a month-long break, Svitolina said she is “actively preparing” to return to tennis in April. Her first visit to Ukraine marks the longest time she has been separated from her daughter.
“Of course, I want to be with her, but I have a bigger mission to do for free Ukrainian people,” said Svitolina, who came to the country as an ambassador of United 24, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s platform for collecting charitable donations.
During her brief stay, she also met Zelenskyy.
On Tuesday, Svitolina visited one of Kyiv’s maternity centers to donate a generator, needed to support the operation of the hospital. Hospitals in the country have often been disrupted by massive Russian missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.
She said this week’s visit triggered the feelings she felt on the first days of the invasion.

“It was extremely stressful for me. I was still playing on the tour then, competing at some tournaments. I couldn’t focus. I couldn’t live my life normally. It was a horrible time for me,” she recalled.
“Visiting the maternity center really reminded me what I was going through and how strong these women are.” Originally from Odesa, which now suffers frequent power outages because of damaged electricity infrastructure, Svitolina said February 24 — the date that will mark one year since the invasion started — will forever be a tragic day for every Ukrainian.
“This is something that you would never wish your enemy to face,” Svitolina said. “It’s a very sad day.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/svitolina-calls-for-russians-to-be-banned-from-olympics-8432812/,sports
Manchester United shares witness 17% jump after reports of Qatari investors’ potential bid,"United fans have been clamouring for a change of ownership and the Glazers have been the target of intense criticism as the team last won silverware back in 2017, lifting the Europa League and League Cup trophies.","The shares of Manchester United witnessed a 17% jump after it was reveled that Qatari investors were planning to make a huge bid to buy the club, according to the Daily Mail.
Bloomberg News reported last month that Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), which owns Paris St Germain, was considering either a total takeover or a stake in Manchester United or their rivals Liverpool.
QSI is a state-backed body founded by the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, but European soccer governing body UEFA has strict integrity rules regarding multi-club ownership.
No club participating in its competitions is allowed to “directly or indirectly hold or deal in the securities or shares of any other club”.
The Daily Mail report states the interested investors are separate from QSI and that the money will come from an “individual fund” rather than a sovereign wealth fund.
Jim Ratcliffe’s company INEOS had formally entered the bidding process to buy United last month after the club’s U.S. owners, the Glazer family, said in November they had begun looking at options including new investment or a potential sale.
United fans have been clamouring for a change of ownership and the Glazers have been the target of intense criticism as the team last won silverware back in 2017, lifting the Europa League and League Cup trophies.

In April, thousands protested outside Old Trafford, lighting flares and singing songs demanding the Glazers “get out of the club”.
The team, managed by Erik ten Hag, are third in the league on 42 points after 21 games, three points behind Manchester City but eight adrift of leaders Arsenal, who have played a game less.

“But also Zimbabwe batted very well. I think overall, I’m pleased with the team effort.”
A draw had seemed the most likely result when rain hampered the start of the test with only 89 overs possible on the first two days after West Indies had opted to bat.

That is bulls**t: Ravi Shastri’s savage reply to Australians’ criticism of Nagpur pitch for 1st India vs Australia Test,"""No excuses, just get on with it, at the end of three days no one’s going to get killed on that surface. The quality of the camera lenses is so good, they can make green grass look brown, that’s what you expect in India, come on,” Shastri said","Former India coach Ravi Shastri had a stern reply when asked about the claims of a ‘doctored’ pitch at Nagpur for the 1st India vs Australia Test.
While speaking on SEN’s Sportsday, co-host Kane Cornes said to Shastri that the “pretty dry” pitch amounted to “cheating” to which the latter replied with a “That is bulls**t!”
“It’s more hype than anything else surrounding this first Test match. It always happens, you get 15mm grass, 18mm grass or 12mm grass in different places around the ground … at the end of this first Test, I’m sure there’ll be someone who scores a hundred. If someone can get a hundred or 80-plus on that pitch, they’ve played well and he will go and say, ‘What’s wrong with the pitch? You stay there, you apply yourself, your shot selection is good, you get runs. But if you go out there and think you’re going to smash every ball, good luck to you,” he said as per Fox Cricket.
“If the ball is going to turn from there, so be it. So what? It’s home conditions, do what suits you, both teams have to play on the surface, there’s a match referee who is the boss, it’s as simple as that. We never complained about pitches, in my career we never complained about a simple pitch.
“No excuses, just get on with it, at the end of three days no one’s going to get killed on that surface. The quality of the camera lenses is so good, they can make green grass look brown, that’s what you expect in India, come on,” he added.
Shastri had also written about the pitch controversy in his column for the Sydney Morning Herald. “There is already a lot of talk about the surface in Nagpur. I think it’s a bit overdone. A pitch is a pitch, and it will be the same for both teams. During my time as Indian coach, we had made it a point to not bother too much about the surface, whether it had grass or mud on it,” he wrote.
“I have no qualms in a home team having pitches that will suit the ammunition they have in their arsenal, whether it’s in Australia or in India. You see the Indian team, and it’s very obvious that their major ammunition is in the spin department. So, it’s natural that they’d want the pitches to start turning early in the piece. It should happen everywhere. That’s the challenge of Test cricket. You go to New Zealand and some of those pitches are green enough to graze on and can have anywhere between 14-18 millimetres of grass. And nobody complains about them,” he added.

"Women’s T20 World Cup 2023 preview: Watch out for Renuka Thakur’s bowling, Tahlia McGrath’s all-round skills, Pakistan’s lower-order hitters",Ahead of the first match of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup -- a tournament replete with storylines and potential newsmakers -- here are the biggest talking points.,"Just weeks after the Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup culminated in the Indian women’s team winning their first ever ICC trophy at any age group, another Indian team will be in the fray to return home from South Africa with a World Cup trophy.
Ahead of the first match of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup — a tournament replete with storylines and potential newsmakers — here are the biggest talking points:
Renuka Thakur to be India’s X Factor?
Buoyed by the recent triumph of India’s Under-19 women’s team at the T20 World Cup and the eye-grabbing figures shelled out for broadcast and franchise rights of the inaugural Women’s Premier League (WPL), India are better placed to win their first senior ICC title than ever before.
The standout performers for the Women in Blue are likely to be the batters: with the experience and ability of Smriti Mandhana and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, and the confidence and explosiveness of U-19 champs Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh. But it will be the bowling that will be a test of India’s title credentials.
Off-spinner Deepti Sharma may be the reliable hand, but the bouncy wickets in South Africa will need a fast bowler to lead the attack. Renuka Thakur has proved in the past year that she is up to the task. While her average and economy rate may be on the higher side, wicket-taking with the new ball will be critical, and in that aspect, Renuka’s record speaks for itself. With 23 scalps from 24 T20Is since the start of 2022, she has more wickets than any other fast-bowler in the world. She will need to be in top form if India are to put up a realistic title charge.
Tahlia McGrath could stand out among Australia’s stars
Australia have lost only one T20I since January 2022 — in a Super Over thriller against India in Mumbai. Having won every ICC title since 2017, along with a Commonwealth Games gold, it is hard to see past them as the overwhelming favourites for another trophy.
In a squad replete with stars, including returning captain Meg Lanning and Alyssa Healy, as well as in-form Beth Mooney and Ellyse Perry, it could be all-rounder Tahlia McGrath, who could be the most vital cog in their winning machine.
ADVERTISEMENT
A true three-way threat, McGrath can hit the deck hard with the ball, and hit the ball hard and flat with the bat — both attributes that are likely to be aided by South African conditions, which, bizarrely, Australia will be new to having never played a series there before.
A fast-bowling allrounder will be critical in South Africa, and McGrath’s numbers — she has averaged 57.87 with the bat and 14.15 with the ball in 18 T20Is since January 2022 –- speak volumes on why she could be critical.
Fitness test puts SA’s home campaign under spotlight
South Africa’s home campaign was derailed by controversy after the coach, Hilton Moreeng, decided to leave out their captain Dane van Niekerk from the squad because she failed a fitness test — a 2km time-trial run — by 18 seconds.
The drawback is not just losing the captain, but also upsetting the star player: van Niekerk’s wife, all-rounder Marizanne Kapp.
ADVERTISEMENT
Kapp took 12 wickets and scored 203 runs to lead South Africa to the semifinal of the ODI World Cup. The Proteas will want her to replicate that form in the World T20, even though she has not played much in the past year. The controversy has put into question the headspace Kapp will arrive in, after missing the last few matches due to ‘compassionate leave’ following her wife’s omission.
At a home World Cup, scrutiny will be even more heightened and could put a dent in their entire campaign.
Pakistan’s lower-order power-hitters
The record of Pakistani women in major tournaments is quite poor. They have never made it out of the group stage of a T20 World Cup. Despite being in the easier group, changing that record looks like a difficult task.
Captain Bismah Maroof is a dependable runscorer at the top of the innings, but if the Pakistan side are to spring a surprise or two, they will rely heavily on power hitters lower down the order.
ADVERTISEMENT
36-year-old Nida Dar is as explosive as she is experienced, making her a dependable finisher, striking at an average of 45.44 in T20Is in the past year. Ayesha Naseem is exactly half her age, but just as crucial.
The 18-year-old does not have a flourishing career yet, but six-hitting ability sets her apart. Her memorable 83-metre six against Australia last month was one of the longest in women’s cricket history, and her 13th since January 2022. She is one to watch out for.
England embrace youth, aggression
Nat-Sciver Brunt’s return from her mental health break last year, and the timely purple patch of the likes of Danni Watt and Sophia Dunkley have boosted England’s batting lineup significantly. Katherine Sciver-Brunt, in the final World Cup of her career, will provide the bowling some much-needed experience.
But it will the return of 18-year-old Alice Capsey, after needing surgery for a collar bone injury in December, and the turn of form of 22-year-old quick Lauren Bell, that will give them the edge.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bell was trusted through and through with the new ball in England’s recent series against West Indies, and her nine wickets at an average below 10, proved just how useful she was. With accumulators at the top, England are in need of a middle-order aggressor to stich the innings together, and Capsey’s explosiveness and ability to rotate the strike well fit the bill perfectly.
In a reset under coach Jon Lewis, England have a newfound aggressive approach — not unlike the men’s team — and bowlers like Bell and batters like Capsey are crucial to it.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-2023-preview-renuka-thakur-india-pakistan-australia-8432675/,sports
FIFA World Cup 2030: Saudi Arabia reportedly offered to bear costs of Greece and Egypt in audacious joint bid,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly offered to pay for the construction costs of stadiums that Greece and Egypt might need to host games, but on the condition that 75 percent of the event is hosted by the Gulf nation.","Fresh on the heels of their neighbours Qatar hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022, Saudi Arabia have stepped up their own audacious joint bid to host football’s showpiece event in 2030, which, if successful, will see the event being held in three continents. The rich nation has reportedly offered to pay for the construction costs of stadiums that Greece and Egypt might need to host games, but on the condition that 75 percent of the event is hosted by the Gulf nation. It is estimated that the costs that Saudi Arabia has to fork out would run into billions of dollars.
According to a report in Politico, the offer was made by Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, in a conversation with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis last year. The report added that the bid was hoping to garner votes from nations in three continents as all of FIFA’s Congress. The FIFA Congress consists of over 200 nations, all of who vote to decide who wins the right to host the World Cup.
The three nations are said to be working on a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup, even though the report added that that there was no certainty if the offer was accepted. Media reports have said that Spain, Portugal and Ukraine are expected to submit a joint bid while the South American nations of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile could also join forces to launch a bid.
The joint bid is the latest move by the Gulf nation to make an imprint in the world of sports. Recently, a Saudi consortium led by the nation’s sovereign wealth fund, called the Public Investment Fund, bought Premier league side, Newcastle United. PIF is also behind the rebel golf tour, LIV Golf.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/fifa-world-cup-2030-saudi-arabia-greece-and-egypt-joint-bid-8432656/,sports
Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Australian batters can take leaf out of Kevin Pietersen’s 2012 playbook to conquer Indian spinners,"Not all batsmen that have succeeded in the sub-continent were Pietersen-like in approach. There are those that grafted and grounded runs, like Alastair Cook. But most of the successful ones this century were stroke-makers like Matthew Hayden, Hashim Amla, Michael Clarke, Damyn Martyn and Joe Root.","Every day before the nets session, Marnus Labuschagne would stand beside the centre pitch and gaze meditatively at the 22-yard brown patch. He would then shift to the side and shadow bat for a few minutes before picking his kit and strolling to the nets, where he would manufacture a rough with his studs and ask the spinners in the nets to pound the abrade region. After every ball, he would inquire his colleagues on his alignment, his knee-flex, head-position and all such-like little details that have made him a batting colossus in the last two years.
Last year, to perfect his spin-game in the subcontinent before the odyssey to Pakistan and Sri Lanka, he invented what he calls a spin carpet, a rubber mat sprinkled with taped aluminium scraps and metal sheets, from where the ball would bounce, leap or skid depending on where and how the ball lands. “I thought, ‘well, what’s the best way I can recreate spin?’ … you can’t really predict what it’s doing so you have to come up with a plan and a method,” he tweeted.
Like Labuschagne, his colleagues too have elaborately prepared to deal with the vicissitudes of subcontinental turners, from preparing on scuffed-up surfaces with low bounce, practising Asia-specific strokes, like the sweeps, using the feet more proactively to meet them on the pitch, art of manoeuvring singles and twos, using the depth of the crease smartly, analysing the bowlers, watching and rewatching them, studying fields and fielders, facing look-alike spinners to get used to the trajectories and lengths, and tuning their muscle-memory. Or rather, they have come planned and prepared to conquer the twirly-men of the sub-continent, buoyed no less by their success in Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well.

Planning and preparation are requisites in taming the spinners, because spin bowling varies in different parts of the world. In Australia, the spinners purchase more bounce and hence batsmen could trust the bounce and play their shots. On wearing surfaces, the ball could leap off a spot or scud along the ground. But not every ball is prone to such fits. The scoring areas are different too; in the sub-continent a lot more runs are scored behind the stumps, through late cuts, sweeps and deflections, whereas in Australia the run-scoring outlets are often in front of the stumps. Worsening their occupation, the nature of turners vary, not just venue-specific but from day-to-day and session-to-session. The turn could be slow and low, or sharp and snappy, the bounce could be true or fickle. A pitch could suddenly slumber and then in the twitch of an eye wake up and emit fire like a hungry dragon.
So the finest overseas players of spin are those that have not only planned and practised but those with a streak of fearlessness and flexibility of mind. Instructive it is to revisit Kevin Pietersen’s 186 in Mumbai, arguably the most destructive knock in the country by an overseas batsmen. It was the perfect blend of the aforementioned qualities. Pietersen had come planned and prepared, which all competent batsmen at this level do, but the soul of the knock was how he revised his plans and found a way to belt runs.

Between the Ahmedabad (17 and 2) and Mumbai Tests he analysed the reasons for his failings and realised that he was not trusting his defensive technique, which is equally important to succeed in these shores. But when in Mumbai, where it turned and bounced, as opposed to Ahmedabad where the bounce was low and turn slow, he realised that he could not survive just by defending. He counter-attacked in bursts, primarily employing the sweeps, some hit firmly, some dabbed fine, some of the reverse variety. But at the core of his success was that he did not cripple his mind with doubts when the odd ones beat him or when he edged. He was as flexible with his strategies as he was with his body.
Not all batsmen that have succeeded in the sub-continent were Pietersen-like in approach. There are those that grafted and grounded runs, like Alastair Cook, but most of the successful ones this century were stroke-makers like Matthew Hayden, the oft-forgotten Hashim Amla, Michael Clarke, Damyn Martyn and Joe Root. And not all of them were exceptional sweepers — Clarke for instance — though the sweep has been the most trusted shot for many. Clarke needn’t because he had nimble feet to glide down the surface. So had Martyn. Root has all the ammo—sweep, quick feet, soft hands, defensive sturdiness, ability to use the depth of the crease and a deep understanding of a spinners’ mind.
Later, India’s skipper Rohit Sharma would detail on approaching spinners on turners: “Everyone has their own method, some like to go straight over the head of the bowler. Some sweep, some reverse sweep, things like that. You have to rotate strike, see what are the methods you can score runs off, you have to think on your feet, because bowlers and captains are smart and they keep changing plans and strategies.”

You also have to choose what shots to play and what not to, against which bowler and when. Like how Pietersen resisted from attempting anything outrageous against Ojha, a tormenter, in the first half of the innings, though in the latter half he did demolish how. Or how Sunil Gavaskar drove Pakistan left-arm spinner Iqbal Qasim only when he strayed into middle and leg and with a full face. When you look at some of the sub-continental batsmen of the past, like VVS Laxman, even when he played against the turn, the ball was met with a full face, before the rubbery wrists kick into action and coax the ball to where his mind whims.
So the real spin test for the Australians would only begin on Thursday, where all that they have imbibed in theory and nets would be put to test, and how effective they are, could decide the outcome of the series. Labuschagne would tell you how difficult it is. In Asia, he averages just 33.33 in seven Tests, a steep dip from his overall average of 59.43, eking out a lone hundred, though that arrived on a Galle minefield. But even after the hundred, he wouldn’t say that he has vanquished the sub-continent spin demons, because the demons keep spooking back.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-trial-by-spin-awaits-aussies-8432617/,sports

"Ranji Trophy: Skipper Mayank Agarwal’s unbeaten ton, Srinivas Sharath’s fifty help Karnataka post 229/5 against Saurashtra",Karnataka scored their runs off 87 overs before the umpires called stumps to the opening day's proceedings.,"Skipper Mayank Agarwal scored an unbeaten century as he rescued Karnataka from a poor start to guide the hosts to 229 for five against Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy semi-final here on Wednesday.
Sent in to bat, Karnataka were in some trouble, losing half their side for 112 in 40.3 overs.
But opener Agarwal (110 not out) held one end together and in the company of wicket-keeper Srinivas Sharath (58 not out) steadied the innings with an unbeaten 117-run partnership for the sixth wicket.
Karnataka scored their runs off 87 overs before the umpires called stumps to the opening day’s proceedings.
Agarwal’s patient knock came off 246 balls during which he struck 11 boundaries and a six, while Sharath faced 143 deliveries during his unconquered knock and hit four fours in the process.
Right-arm medium pacer Kushang Patel picked up two wickets, while Chetan Sakariya and Prerak Mankad accounted for one Karnataka batter each. The other wicket fell to a run out.
Karnataka did not have the best of starts as they lost opener Ravikumar Samarth in the sixth over, caught by Vishvaraj Jadeja off the bowling of Patel.

New man in Devdutt Padikkal didn’t last long, caught by Sheldon Jackson off Sakariya’s bowling in the opening delivery of the ninth over.
Agarwal and Nikin Jose (18) shared 47 runs for the next wicket before the latter nicked a Patel delivery to Harvik Desai behind the stumps in the 29th over.
Manish Pandey didn’t trouble the scorers much, becoming Mankad’s scalp and overs later Shreyas Gopal (15) became the victim of a run out as Karnataka slumped to 112 for 5.
But Agarwal and Sharath joined hands and played sensibly without taking any risks to deny Saurashtra further inroads.

The Border-Gavaskar Trophy has grown to be one of the most highly anticipated Test series for cricket fans worldwide since its inception in 1996.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-when-and-where-to-watch-india-vs-australia-test-live-streaming-in-india-8431880/,sports
"Border Gavaskar Trophy: Suryakumar Yadav perfectly equipped to play Tests, Nathan Lyon will miss Mitchell Starc’s footmarks, says Sachin Tendulkar","Talking about India's No. 1 batter Virat Kohli and his return to form in white-ball cricket, Tendulkar said it augurs well for the team ahead of Test series against Australia.","Test cricket is indeed a different ball game but Suryakumar Yadav with his amazing skill-set and the ability to think out of the box is “perfectly equipped” to play the traditional format, the legendary Sachin Tendulkar opined on Wednesday.
In a wide-ranging interview with PTI, Tendulkar spoke about the importance of match-ups, sweep shot against spinners, brilliance of Ravichandran Ashwin and the understated importance of Cheteshwar Pujara, who is gearing up to play his 99th Test at Jamtha on Thursday.
“From entering into T20s and ODIs and now in the Test squad, he has made an incredible impression around the globe. Whoever follows Surya, they fall in love with his ability and way he thinks,” Tendulkar said.
“But Test cricket is going to be different. Surya looks perfectly equipped to play Test cricket. Someone of his calibre should be considered along with KL Rahul and Shubman Gill. All three are capable players and I don’t want to pass any judgement here but all three are capable enough to walk into the team,” he said.
Tendulkar, Test cricket’s highest run scorer, did not want to be dragged into the debate on ideal playing XI but said consistency is a must to retain spot in the team.
“I don’t want to get into team combinations and all that. But if we get into recent past, Shubman Gill has been in good form and Rahul hasn’t been able to contribute, but such is life. You go through these ups and downs. They both are excellent players and to retain position in the team, one has to continue scoring runs,” Tendulkar said when asked whether the team management would struggle to finalise the playing eleven.
Talking about India’s No. 1 batter Virat Kohli and his return to form in white-ball cricket, Tendulkar said it augurs well for the team ahead of Test series against Australia.
ADVERTISEMENT
“With the way he has played in last few months, I really liked watching that, very assertive, very certain of what he wanted to do.” Tendulkar would be certainly watching the keen contest between Nathan Lyon and Kohli as that would be one of the great match-ups.
“World cricket needs these kind of rivalries. It is important to have those rivalries and remember when Australia had come in 1998, it was termed Warne vs Tendulkar and I had to remind everyone that it is not Warne vs Tendulkar but Australia vs India. But everyone likes to see such rivalries.” Don’t think we recognise Pujara’s true value.
Pujara is set to complete 100-Test milestone during the second game of the series at the Kotla in New Delhi. Someone with 7000-plus Test runs in 98 games, Pujara is expected to be another thorn in Aussie flesh.
“I feel Pujara’s achievements aren’t recognised enough and his importance in the team isn’t recognised enough, generally,” said the man, who has played an unprecedented 200 Tests.
ADVERTISEMENT
“He has played magnificently for the country and his contribution has been immense in whatever success Indian cricket team has had,” said Tendulkar, who was in fact at the other end when Pujara scored a half-century on his Test debut.
Nathan Lyon will also miss Starc
The Australians will certainly miss Mitchell Starc but for Tendulkar, left-arm pacer’s absence might lessen the impact of off-spinner Lyon.
Starc, who comes around the wicket (over the wicket for left-armers) often creates rough with his footmarks in his follow through and that becomes troublesome for right-handed batters (when a spinner operates and exploits rough patch).
“Lyon is a world class bowler and he becomes more effective when Starc is there because of the rough patches created for right handers outside the off stump. These are the things which will come into play.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ashwin’s skills as well as mind-games will make the series more engaging
The conventional thought process tells that spinners will come into play when the ball is old but in case of Ravichandran Ashwin, a bit of nip in the morning air and some moisture in the surface could bring him into play in the very first hour, the maestro said.
“I think he is just one short of 450 wickets. Ashwin is a world class bowler and he has been delivering amazing performances for a number of years now. The variation he has is really, really special and he isn’t afraid to try out things. He wants to make batter’s life uncomfortable and that’s how it should be.” “It is all about owning those 22 yards and he has multiple variations which can force a batter to think in different manner and disturb a batter’s gameplan. Along with that he likes to play mind games and that
is what makes any series far more exciting, interesting and engaging.”
Ravindra Jadeja is good enough to bat at No. 6
Jadeja’s presence in the eleven lends the requisite balance and Tendulkar believes he is competent enough to regularly bat at number six in Tests.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Jadeja as a package is tremendous. If you notice in the last few seasons, he has upped his batting and for me he is good enough to bat at No. 6 and played enough crucial innings for India. In bowling also, he recently played a first-class match and got wickets (seven vs Tamil Nadu). He had that unfortunate (knee) injury and players like him will overcome challenges.
“What Jadeja has achieved, he has become a crucial part of this Indian cricket team. A brilliant fielder as well and if I am not wrong, he is eight wickets short of 250-mark. He has also scored 2500 runs. He is in that special league of players, not many guys have been able to achieve in Test cricket.” Reverse swing will be a factor
While everyone is talking about the impact spinners will have, Tendulkar said reverse swing will also be crucial.
“The first hour of every morning, seamers will come into play and so will the spinners because in the morning there is going to be that bite in the surface.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I remember playing one game in Nagpur where spinners dominated the morning session. The odd ball went straight and other one spun viciously. It became difficult for batters to gauge which one will turn and which one will come straight. It’s going to be both and reverse will come into play in this series.”
We don’t expect tracks that aid spinners in Australia
A challenge of being an international cricketer is to adapt to different kinds of surfaces and Tendulkar feels that when a team comes to India, they should be well aware that pitches will offer turn.
“When you become an international cricketer, you are supposed to play on any kind of surface in the world. Those are challenges of travelling. When we go to Australia, we don’t expect turners there. We know nature of the surface is going to be a little bouncy and more pace in it and upfront movement of seam.
ADVERTISEMENT
“So is the case with Australian team, when they are in India. They know that there will be turn and nature of the surface will be slowish. They are prepared for that, they have practised with SG balls. Every team prepares to the best of their abilities and it is what happens around them amplify but the team is always in a different space compared to what outsiders are thinking.
“I feel Aussies are prepared to play and face the challenges.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-suryakumar-yadav-equipped-to-play-tests-nathan-lyon-mitchell-starc-footmarks-sachin-tendulkar-india-vs-australia-8432479/,sports

We are not interested: Javed Miandad clarifies his ‘India can go to hell’ comment","Following the Asian Cricket Council week last meet, the BCCI made their stand clear on the Indian team not travelling to Pakistan to play the upcoming Asia Cup.","Asked about his recent comment of “India can go to hell” while talking about the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) rigid stance on not touring Pakistan for the 2023 Asia Cup, Pakistan legend Javed Miandad clarified his comment on Wednesday.
“Do you know what hell means? If you don’t want to play just don’t. We don’t have a problem. Ask the Indian cricketers. They’ll also say that there should be cricket between these two teams in their respective countries. It’ll benefit both nations,” he said.
“If they think that their (India) not coming to Pakistan makes any difference, let me tell you that it doesn’t. That’s what I meant. We are independent. Pakistan has produced world class cricketers as well as hockey players. Everywhere around the world, neighbour countries are playing with each other,” he added.
Talking about previous encounters between India and Pakistan when the tension between the countries were at the wane, he said, “Earlier we used to go there and then they used to come here. When India came to play a series in Pakistan, there were so many people from India who also came to watch. There were no hotels available and the Lahore residents invited them to their houses. It had a very good impact on the relationships between the two countries.”
Asked what his reaction was to the Indian media talking about his comments, he said, “The media there is like this only. The competition there is very high. They even write so many things about the Indian players only and I am left surprised by them. This is not done. You should take comments in a positive way. Our press don’t react that way to Indian players. What I meant with my comment was if you are not playing, go. (Nahi khelna hain toh jaayein, humein kya hain?) Doesn’t make a difference to us. We are not interested.”
“I just want that the neighbours maintain a good relationship. There are so many Pakistani citizens who have their relatives in India and vice versa. In Pakistan, we don’t discriminate on basis of religion. When there are Hindu festivals, they are given full facilities. There are also mandirs here. What I meant by my comment was if yopu are not playing, what should we do? It’s not like if India play, we’ll get something out of it. I am just saying, there’ll be a good relationship between the two countries,” he added.
“I went and met Bal Thackeray in his house. He was so nice to me. I did 9 programmes, even on the roads. Everything went by without a glitch. There are some people in India twist things. But if you take the Indian masses, they are not like this only. My comment was also twisted. They didn’t understand what I meant. I said it in a positive way,” he said before signing off.

"Border-Gavaskar Trophy: No longer lead acts, but Virat Kohli and Steve Smith remain central characters for India, Australia","No matter how their careers have unfolded since the last series between the two countries on Indian soil, the former captains’ shadows will cast the longest during the four-Test series.","The burning sun above their head, Pat Cummins and Rohit Sharma posed beside the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the customary pre-series photo shoot. The captains exchanged a hug, handshake and chuckle before they hurriedly escaped the harsh sun. It was exactly how the previous meeting between the two sides in the subcontinent took off, with a warm camaraderie, though the men beside the shimmering trophy were Steve Smith and Virat Kohli. And how the feisty and fascinating series ended, with heat and fire, accusations and recriminations, with Kohli quipping that “he would never be friends with Australians.”
In many ways, it was a Kohli-Smith series, their country’s finest batsmen, indomitable leaders, inscrutable figureheads, their teams stoked and forged in their ideals, two superstars locked in a relentless arm-wrestle for glory, each unbudging and unflappable. It was touted, and with sufficient realism, that this was the first of their several generation-defining bouts between them. Like Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar, like Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

"Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Shubman Gill should get nod against Australia, vice-captains shouldn’t be automatic choice, says Ravi Shastri","Picking his XI for the opening game of the four-Test series, Shastri also said no one comes close to Suryakumar Yadav at No.5, and the middle-order T20I batter should get his preferred position in the series.","Former India coach Ravi Shastri wants in-form batter Shubman Gill to be in the playing XI ahead of vice-captain KL Rahul in the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar series, beginning in Nagpur on Thursday.
The former India all-rounder also said vice-captaincy should not guarantee one a place in the playing eleven if someone like Gill is hitting the sweet spot with monotonous regularity in white-ball cricket.
Picking his XI for the opening game of the four-Test series, Shastri also said no one comes close to Suryakumar Yadav at No.5, and the middle-order T20I batter should get his preferred position in the series.
“Shubman or Rahul (selection) depends on the team management, what they think. Obviously, you’d want to go with what you’ve been doing in the past, but form becomes critical.
“Someone’s hitting it real sweet and it’s coming out of the centre of the bat. Then, you know, you wake up, and say, ‘listen’,” Shastri said on the ICC Review on Wednesday.
“I’ve been watching Gill and Rahul very closely in the nets. If it’s a hard call; when I see footwork, when I see timing as to who is batting better. If it has to be Shubman ahead of Rahul, so be it. You know, straight. You have to see that. I won’t say that Rahul is the vice-captain so he becomes the automatic choice.” A lot of heat has been generated in the Australian media about India preparing “doctored pitches”, but Shastri emphatically said he wanted the ball to turn square as there was no harm in capitalising on the home advantage.
“If someone asks me what kind of pitch? Expect that. If you lose the toss, expect the ball to turn in the first session of play. That’s what I want, and take it from there.” “My mindset would be, ‘How can I beat Australia 4-0 if I’m the coach’, which means day one, I want a ball to pitch on leg stump and hit off stump. I want it to rip.” The former India all-rounder wants wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav to do that job and weave his “magic” around the Australian batters.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I’d like to see some magic. I’d like to see some Kuldeep Yadav stuff. If you lose the toss on day one, if it’s a good pitch where it’s not turning, the finger spinner is not getting enough, I want a leg-spinner to be able to rip it. Spin it before probably any other spinner in the game,” added Shastri.
He also added that India being the host should strive for a 4-0 victory.
“India should look to win 4-0, we’re playing at home. I’m brutal. I’ve been to two tours of Australia, I know what’s happened,” Shastri said.
With Suryakumar in the form of his life in T20 cricket, his presence in the squad has added to the intrigue ahead of the Nagpur Test. But Shastri said the team management should not look beyond the charismatic batter and hand him the Test debut.
“At number five, Suryakumar will get the position, because there’s no Shreyas (Iyer). There’ll be talk about, ‘can Gill bat at five?’ I think you need the right guy for the right number. At five, when you go there, especially if the ball is turning, then you need someone who is good at playing the right shots against spin.
“Surya demands that position. I think it’s straightforward.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-shubman-gill-ravi-shastri-vice-captain-automatic-choice-8432196/,sports

There is a new Haaland in town: Serie A’s rising star Rasmus Højlund hitting the right notes,"The Danish forward, who has compared himself to his Norwegian counterpart, is making waves in Italian Serie A with a string of match-winning performances for Atalanta.","Serie A sensation Rasmus Winther Højlund, who plays for Atalanta, is drawing parallels with Manchester City star Erling Haaland. The youngster turned 20 last Saturday and is the youngest foreign player to have scored at least three away goals in the Italian league this season. Within the five major European leagues, only Bayern Münich’s Jamal Musiala is ahead with a higher tally of away goals (4) than Højlund.
Højlund’s footwork for a 6’3 striker 🇩🇰⚡️#SerieA #AtalantaSamp #GoAtalantaGopic.twitter.com/2H3ROAJyq8
— Danish Football (@DanishFTBL) January 28, 2023
Last summer, amidst the hype of the arrival of ‘new Erling Haaland’, Atalana secured Højlund’s services for €17m. Standing at 1.91m/ /6’3″ tall, his combination of height, pace, and power has seen comparisons to City’s goal-scoring machine, and Hojlund has already started to show just what he can do with a spectacular run of form and goals. Like Haaland, who is 1.94 m/6’4″ tall and has a similar Scandinavian descent, Hojlund is also a No.9 and can play as a lone striker upfront.
This has led to some of the top European clubs keeping a keen eye on him. AC Milan are reportedly targeting him to boost their attacking lineup. According to the Sport, Real Madrid are reportedly keeping a tab on the potential Haaland clone.
As a child, Hojlund used to imitate Cristiano Ronaldo. “One day he told me that he would imitate Cristiano in everything, and he started exercising every night, even with the flu,” his father Anders recalled in an interview with Sportek. The first memory Anders has of his son is the little one playing with a beach ball bigger than him and that day he started kicking the ball. “There I knew he was left-handed,” recalled Anders.
A product of the Brondby youth academy, Højlund started as a youngster at Boldklubben in 1893 before joining Copenhagen in 2017, where he finally hit the ground running during the 2020-21 season when he scored 15 goals in 22 games for the club’s U-19 side.
Austrian side Sturm Graz then purchased him for €1.9m from Danish club FC Copenhagen in January 2022, and in just six months, his market value soared high. It was his transfer to SK Sturm Graz that did wonders for him. His record at the Austrian club was an eye-catching 12 goals in 21 games across all competitions.
“I see parallels between myself and Erling Haaland,” Hojlund had said upon his arrival in Austria. “He is fast, left-footed, tall, has a good nose for goal, and is a classy finisher. His mentality is also completely insane,” he had added.
One of the goals for Graz included a strike that saw him drive forward through the Salzburg backline before firing home an unstoppable left-footed shot, much in the way Haaland had done.

Raffael Behounek, the Tirol defender who marked Hojlund on his Graz debut, gave an insight into playing against him. Speaking to Laola1, he said, “He will be worth every penny. He is an absolute machine. When he has space, he is tough to defend against.”
When Atalanta signed Højlund, he was a player who either scored a goal or provided an assist every 113 minutes during his time in Graz. After settling in, Hojlund is taking centre stage, scoring in his last four games between Serie A and the Coppa Italia. That included a spectacular strike in the recent 5-2 Coppa Italia victory over Spezia. Currently, in 24 games (including the Champions League), he has 11 goals and five assists.

Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini has spoken highly of the youngster’s talent. “He has extraordinary margins, the evolution he’s had in recent months… He had to get into matches right away. He’s incredibly generous, he has the desire to achieve results. Technically he has margins, in the air, he can do well there too given his stature. He can be a top future striker,” Gasperini said.
Last month, in a match between Atalanta and Bologna, Højlund scored a goal of the highest calibre as he exploded into space and dinked the goalkeeper effortlessly.
Statistically, Højlund is getting the numbers – his 6.42 touches per 90 minutes in the attacking third is quite impressive. His 8.40 received progressive passes back this up, and place him in the top five per cent of centre-forwards.

Hojlund was handed his full Denmark debut in September and was part of the team that beat then-world champions France 2-0 in the UEFA Nations League.

While the two competing nations may not yet be known, there are a host of significant fixtures due to be played in the coming weeks to determine the finalists. Australia currently top the standings, with India in hot pursuit in second place, and both the teams go head-to-head across a four-Test series starting in Nagpur on Thursday.
While six teams in total stand a chance of qualification, among the frontrunners to challenge the top two are Sri Lanka, who sit third in the standings and South Africa in fourth, who take on reigning WTC champions New Zealand and the West Indies respectively over two two-Test series during February and March.
On the potential of securing their place at the showpiece event, Australia skipper Pat Cummins said, “The prospect of playing in the World Test Championship Final has been a big motivator for us over the last couple of years, more so now having missed out on over rates last time.
“To play at a neutral venue like The Oval adds another element for both sides who make the Final. It’s exciting and has been a goal of ours for a while now.
“We are confident we can secure a place while here in India after a really strong 12 months. The Final would be a great reward for the players and staff who have done so well.” India captain Rohit Sharma looks ahead to what could be a second successive WTC Final encounter.

"Pat Cummins plays down pitch concerns, Green out of Nagpur opener","The way the Nagpur pitch has been prepared has left the area outside left-handers' off-stump dry at both ends. Cummins did not reveal his playing XI, but Australia could potentially pick five left-handed batsmen in their top seven, setting the scene for a potential a trial by spin.","Home advantage is part of the challenge of test cricket, Australia’s captain said on Wednesday before his team’s series opener against India in Nagpur, after parts of the Australian media accused the hosts of selectively watering the pitch.
Pat Cummins, whose team just need to avoid a 4-0 whitewash to make the World Test Championship final in June, conceded that Australia’s left-handed batsmen might have to work extra hard to score runs during the match, which begins on Thursday.
The way the Nagpur pitch has been prepared has left the area outside left-handers’ off-stump dry at both ends. Cummins did not reveal his playing XI, but Australia could potentially pick five left-handed batsmen in their top seven, setting the scene for a potential a trial by spin.
“That’s part of the challenge of playing away,” Cummins told reporters.
“Home teams want to win at home. In Australia, we’re lucky we’ve normally got pace and bounce.
“Home match advantage, I don’t think it’s a terrible thing. It’s another challenge and makes touring over here even harder when you know the conditions are custom-made for them.”
Cummins said all-rounder Cameron Green, recovering from a finger injury, would miss the opener, joining pacemen Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc on the sidelines.

Australia may blood uncapped Todd Murphy alongside fellow off-spinner Nathan Lyon, and Peter Handscomb might pip Matthew Renshaw for the number six position to bring right-handed variety in their southpaw-heavy lineup.
“I think it is a factor over here,” Cummins said.
“With so much traffic from the right-handers’ bowling, at times there is a bit more out there for the left handers.”

Border Gavaskar Trophy: Virat Kohli vs Steve Smith rivalry – The tale of two legends,Both mavericks are coming out of lean run patches in their career and are inching back to the peak of their powers again. They have everything to play for and a point to prove in the upcoming series.,"The Australian summer of 2014/15 saw arguably two of the greatest cricketers of all time taking on each other. The number of runs Virat Kohli and Steve Smith piled on in that series was the setting stone of what the cricketing world was about to witness for years to come. However, it hasn’t been all glory for either of them since the years have passed. They have had their fair share of criticisms, ups-and-down and controversies in their illustrious careers so far.
The four-match series between these two sides have been filled with thrilling narratives and storylines. One of those storylines is the question of who will outscore who? Both mavericks are coming out of lean-run patches in their career. Both are inching back to the peak of their powers again.
Back to form
Steve Smith’s form in the Australian summer has been mind-boggling. He scored 486 runs in five Tests in the summer at a brutal average of 92.62. Prior to the summer, Smith’s form had been on a downward trajectory. He was dropped from the T20I side during last year’s World Cup in home conditions. In 2020, Smith had a test average of 18.25 from four Test matches – the lowest ever in his career.
Kohli’s tale hasn’t been too dissimilar in recent times either. Kohli is averaging 23.60 in Test cricket since his last 100. However, his white-ball performances in the recent home season show that he is back to his very best. His 166 against Sri Lanka in Thiruvananthapuram reminded everyone of the vintage batsman we have been used to seeing over the years. The ability to hit boundaries at will seems to be back and his technique once again looks like a well-oiled machine.
With both the batters in good form, there will be a competitive edge to this rivalry to outscore each other. In all these years Smith and Kohli have played a complete series against each other only once. In the 2014/15 series, the Australian scored 769 runs at an average of 128.17 and Kohli scored 692 runs at 86.50.
Post this series, both batters either missed a series or an odd test match in a tour here and there to make a fair assessment of who was better.

The captaincy arc
ADVERTISEMENT
As captains, both led their sides from the front. Kohli scored 5864 test runs as captain at an average of 54.80 which included 20 centuries from 68 games. Smith on the other hand scored 3793 runs as captain at an average of 61.17 with 15 centuries in just 36 games.
However, Virat Kohli did win a series in Australia in 2018/19 which Smith couldn’t do in India in 2017. The series won by Kohli in 2018/19 did not feature David Warner and Steve Smith. In 2020/21, when India won with a depleted side, after Kohli left post the first game in Adelaide, the Australian full-time skipper at the time was Tim Paine.
Both players as leaders gained immense respect from their team members and were admired in the world of cricket for the brand of cricket they played. Nevertheless, captaincy ended abruptly for both of them. Steve Smith’s sandpaper gate scandal in 2018 in Capetown caused his downfall as a skipper. Despite him being the vice-captain of the side now, the incident will always be a mark in his career.
The DRS controversy in the 2017 series against India when Smith tried to take suggestions from the dressing room on whether to take a review or not, while he was batting, did not do his credentials as captain any good either. In the 35 Tests that he captained, he won 19 and lost 10.
ADVERTISEMENT
Kohli’s tale hasn’t been filled with so many colourful stories in terms of controversy. However, the way he left as an Indian Test captain left a bitter taste in the mouths of a lot of Indian supporters. He gave away his captaincy after India’s series loss to South Africa in January last year. Prior to that Kohli gave up on T20I captaincy in 2021 before the T20 World Cup and was subsequently removed as ODI captain later that year despite the player himself indicating not having any will to step down.
The runs from the bat stopped. Centuries were hard to come by during this phase. The bubble filled up and eventually burst. “It’s been seven years of hard work, toil and relentless perseverance every day to take the team in the right direction. I’ve done the job with absolute honesty and left nothing out there,” Kohli said in a statement when he gave up the captaincy of the side.
He is India’s most successful captain with 27 wins from 64 games. His aggression and passion on the field were a joy to behold for many Indian supporters and Test cricket lovers.
The next generation
Marnus Labuschagne and Shubman Gill have arrived onto international cricket. They have been piling runs, scoring ton after ton. Labuschagne has scored 957 runs at an average of 56.29 in the last calendar year with four centuries.
ADVERTISEMENT
Gill recently scored a double ton against New Zealand in an ODI and his maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December in turning conditions against decent spinners, proving he is here to stay. Both players have shown the potential to be possible future candidates for leading their respective national teams.
The cricketing world keeps moving on hence the rivalry between Kohli-Smith in this series is even more fascinating to watch as this might be the last chance they have to go at each other full throttle.

LeBron James: ‘The pass-first guy’ without a signature shot who scaled the NBA’s points mountaintop,"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record stood for 38 years. At 38, LeBron James, in Lakers colours, took the record many believed would never leave Abdul-Jabbar’s possession. James did so without a signature shot – that one trusted move that the greatest bank on.","Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had his skyhook. Michael Jordan had his iconic fadeaway jump shot. So did Kobe Bryant. Steph Curry has those audacious pull-up three-pointers that he could probably swish into the basket without leaving the locker room in the Chase Centre. But when time comes to run the highlight reel on LeBron James’ career — the man who will end his career as the all-time top-scorer in the NBA, ahead of Kareem, Jordan, Bryant, Curry and everyone else to have played in the league — people might have to scratch their heads a little as they ponder the question: just what was James’s signature shot?
That is the question that will puzzle even the most devout fan of the 38-year-old, who on Wednesday overhauled Abdul-Jabbar’s longstanding record (the record was a few months older than James) of 38,387 points with an efficient performance against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He made it to the milestone in the third quarter, shooting 12-18 in 26 minutes of play and went to the free throw line ten times, making eight of those attempts.

James chased the 36 points necessary to surpass Abdul-Jabbar’s record 38,387 points with determination, scoring 20 in the first half in front of a crowd urging him forward.
The fans roared with every point while he rolled toward the mark held since April 1984 by Abdul-Jabbar, who watched the game from a baseline seat near the Lakers’ bench. James’ mother, wife and three children also watched from courtside amid the thousands who rose in waves of anticipation nearly every time James touched the ball.

With four championship rings and nearly every other honor available to a basketball player, the 38-year-old James closed in on this next moment in history with the confidence of a player who has been even better than anyone could have expected two decades ago when the kid from Akron, Ohio, reached the NBA.
“The expectations were all the way out to Pluto, and he went ahead and created his own galaxy,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said before the game.
The crowd was in its seats far earlier than normal in Los Angeles, and James got numerous ovations before the Lakers and the Oklahoma City Thunder got rolling. The fans then stood when he touched the ball on the Lakers’ opening possession, and they groaned when he missed his first two shots and elected to pass.

Each Lakers possession seemed weighted with anticipation, and James has always thrived under such pressure: He hit a 3-pointer with 7:06 left in the first quarter for his first bucket, and he kept playing after getting hit in the face by an inadvertent elbow moments later.
Lakers fans are no strangers to witnessing historic moments, and they turned out ferociously for the chance to see a once-in-a-generation achievement.

The moment was irresistible to fans like Aaron Sanchez, one of the hundreds of jersey-clad Lakers faithful patiently taking turns posing in front of the statue of Abdul-Jabbar that stands on the plaza in front of the Lakers’ downtown arena.

Sanchez shares a set of two season tickets with a few friends and family, and he already had the seats for Tuesday’s game months before anyone could predict the magic day. He turned down a friend’s offer of $200 to swap the Thunder seats, but he’s out of luck if James waits until Thursday to break the record, since those tickets belong to a different friend.

“It’s basketball history, and that’s what the Lakers are all about,” Sanchez said. “LeBron is already one of the greatest Lakers ever, and getting this record in a Lakers uniform just makes it more certain. He was our leader after Kobe (Bryant) died, and he’s our leader now.”
Indeed, James has already earned a special place in Lakers fans’ hearts over his five seasons in purple and gold. Several months before he won the franchise’s 17th championship in the Florida bubble, he truly became a part of Lakers lore with his inspirational words and steady leadership in the wake of Bryant’s death in a helicopter crash.

Jessica Pegula reveals her mother Kim Pegula’s health crisis,"Kim Pegula, she wrote, went into cardiac arrest while sleeping and received lifesaving CPR from another daughter until paramedics arrived and restored her heartbeat.","Pro tennis player Jessica Pegula has revealed that her mother, Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres co-owner and president Kim Pegula, went into cardiac arrest in June and is still recovering while dealing with significant language and memory issues.
In an essay that The Players’ Tribune published Tuesday, Jessica Pegula detailed for the first time the medical crisis that abruptly removed her mother from the public eye and suggested that her mother may not resume the same level of involvement in the family’s sports franchises.
Kim Pegula, she wrote, went into cardiac arrest while sleeping and received lifesaving CPR from another daughter until paramedics arrived and restored her heartbeat. The family previously said only that Kim Pegula was receiving medical care for “some unexpected health issues” that arose shortly after she celebrated her 53rd birthday.
“My mom is working hard in her recovery, she is improving, but where she ends up is still unknown,” Jessica Pegula, 28, wrote.
She said she decided to write about her mother’s ordeal after Bills player Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest on the field during a Jan. 2 game in Cincinnati in what Pegula described as “some bizarre, messed-up, full circle moment.”
“My stomach sunk because it felt like the exact same thing all over again. I was sitting on the bench for a tennis event in Sydney, Australia. I wanted to throw up,” wrote Jessica Pegula, who is No. 4 in the WTA’s singles rankings. “I was supposed to go on for mixed doubles in 15 minutes and I remember telling one of my teammates, `I am a little freaked out right now, this is too close to home, and I feel like I am going to have a panic attack.’”
As Hamlin began his recovery, Jessica Pegula joined in an outpouring of support from fans and the NFL and wore a white screen-printed patch with Hamlin’s uniform number while playing at the Australian Open. “It didn’t feel like it was just for him, it felt like it was for my mom as well,” she said.

Jessica Pegula had been home in Florida months earlier when she got a call from her sister, Kelly, around midnight on their mother’s birthday and learned that their mother was being rushed to the hospital.
“My mom was asleep when my dad woke up to her going into cardiac arrest and she was unresponsive for quite a while,” she wrote. Kelly Pegula, who was staying with their parents, performed CPR — just three months after telling her family that she planned to become certified in the procedure for a job.
“I remember her telling us what she was doing in our family group chat,” Jessica Pegula wrote, “and my mom even responded, `Nice Kells! Now if we have a heart attack you can revive us.’”
Today, Kim Pegula “can read, write, and understand pretty well, but she has trouble finding the words to respond,” Jessica Pegula wrote. “It is hard to deal with and it takes a lot of patience to communicate with her, but I thank God every day that we can still communicate with her at all. The doctors continue to be blown away by her recovery, considering where she started, and her determination is the driving force of that.”

As the first woman to serve as president of an NHL and NFL team at the same time, Kim Pegula “lived it and loved it, and it was felt by everyone she met,” Jessica Pegula wrote. “Now we come to the realization that all of that is most likely gone. That she won’t be able to be that person anymore.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/jessica-pegula-reveals-her-mother-kim-pegulas-health-crisis-8430340/,sports

"Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay submit joint 2030 World Cup bid","Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez made a statement on his official Twitter account saying that Bolivia will be asked to join ""this dream"".","Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay officially submitted a joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup on Tuesday, calling for the tournament to return “where football was born” 100 years after the first World Cup was held in Montevideo.
During a ceremony at the Argentine Football Association (AFA), officials of the four countries were joined by Alejandro Dominguez, president of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), who said that he hopes FIFA can show a “gesture of greatness” toward the region and allow it to organise the tournament.
“The 2030 World Cup is not just another World Cup, it deserves a celebration with recognition for 100 years,” Dominguez said.
“We are convinced that FIFA has an obligation to honour the memory of those who came before us and believed in greatness and made the first World Cup.”
AFA president Claudio Tapia added: “As world champions, we carry out this launch which is the dream of all South Americans. Not only on the centenary of the first edition, but because of the passion with which we live football.”
Argentina’s President Alberto Fernandez made a statement on his official Twitter account saying that Bolivia will be asked to join “this dream”.
After the first edition in Uruguay, Argentina hosted the World Cup in 1978 and Chile in 1962, while Paraguay has never hosted the sport’s biggest competition.

Paris 2024: Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo says Russian contingent won’t be allowed at Olympics next year if Ukraine War continues,"Anne Hidalgo had previously said Russian athletes could compete at the Paris Olympics under a neutral flag. But she has now called that prospect ""indecent"".","Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo says there should be no Russian delegation allowed at the Paris Olympics next year if Moscow continues its war against Ukraine.
Hidalgo previously said Russian competitors could take part under a neutral flag but she backpedaled on Tuesday in an interview with French media France Info.
Acknowledging that a final decision belongs to the International Olympic Committee, Hidalgo said she wishes Russian athletes will be banned “as long as there is this war, this Russian aggression on Ukraine.”
“It is not possible to parade as if nothing had happened, to have a delegation that comes to Paris while the bombs continue to rain down on Ukraine.”
Hidalgo’s comments came after Ukraine’s sports minister last week renewed a threat to boycott the games if Russia and Belarus are allowed to compete and said Kyiv would lobby others to join.
No nation has so far declared it will boycott the 2024 Summer Games. But Ukraine won support from Poland, the Baltic nations and Denmark, who pushed back against an IOC plan to allow delegations from Russia and ally Belarus to compete in Paris as “neutral athletes” without flags or anthems.
Hidalgo said she would find it “totally indecent” if Russian athletes competed in the French capital under those terms. But she left the door open for Russian dissidents who don’t support President Vladimir Putin’s actions to parade in Paris “under a refugee banner.”

Russia has cautiously welcomed the IOC’s decision to give it a path to the Olympics but demands it drop a condition that would leave out those athletes deemed to be “actively supporting the war in Ukraine.”
Russian Olympic Committee head Stanislav Pozdnyakov, who was a teammate of Ukraine’s Huttsait at the 1992 Olympics, called that aspect discriminatory. The IOC, which previously recommended excluding Russia and Belarus from world sports on safety grounds, now argues it cannot discriminate against them purely based on citizenship.
Asked by The Associated Press about the boycott threats and the IOC plan, Paris 2024 organizing committee head Tony Estanguet said he would not comment “about political decisions.”
If the IOC proposal takes effect, Paris would be the fourth straight Olympics where Russian athletes have competed without the national flag or anthem. The Russian teams at the Winter Olympics in 2018 and 2022 and the Summer Olympics in 2021 were caught up in the fallout from state-sponsored doping.

One could easily miss him among the plethora of net bowlers who sweat it out at any touring team’s nets before the uncanny resemblance with Ravichandran Ashwin’s action surprises you.
He is only four first-class matches old but the Australian team has made him a travelling net bowler and he is lapping up every bit of attention he is getting.
“Maine pahle din hi Steve Smith ko 5 se 6 baar out kiya thaa nets mein (I had got Smith out at least six times in the nets on first day),” a smiling Mahesh told PTI as he stood in one corner watching his idol Ashwin go about his job in the nets.
Talk about Ashwin, the 21-year-old started beaming. Mahesh has generated curiosity among India players as well.
“Today I got blessings from my idol. I have always wanted to bowl like him. When I am met him as he was entering the nets, I touched his feet and sought his blessings. He hugged me and then asked what exactly am I bowling to the Australians,” he said.
“Virat Kohli also smiled at me and gestured thumbs up and wished me luck,” you couldn’t miss the pride in his voice.

He has just started his journey in senior cricket for Baroda and that is what is his focus at the moment.
“I have started my journey in Ranji Trophy and I want to focus on my red ball game. I want to cement my place in the Baroda side. I am not thinking about IPL now,” said Mahesh, who had worked in a tea stall few years ago.
So what exactly does he bowl? Does he have a carrom ball or a slider like Ashwin? “No, I don’t bowl carrom ball or doosra. My stock ball is off break and another ball that I have myself developed is one that has a bit of backspin in it. But I bowl that in white-ball cricket,” said the man who lives with his parents, elder brother and sister in law.
Bowling to Smith and Labuschagne has been a life changing experience for him.

“It has been amazing to work with this Australian side. My job is to mainly bowl to Steve Smith at Australia nets. He didn’t ask me to bowl anything specific.” Mahesh feels lucky that he is able to interact a lot with Nathan Lyon who has given him some invaluable tips on the art of off spin.
“Lyon first asked me to show my grip and explain what I do while rolling my fingers. He then explained how I can get more revs (rotation) on the ball and also how my front leg (left) should land. He told me to have confidence in my ability.” The Australian team be using Mahesh’s services till the start of the second Test in Delhi.
“I am there with the team till February 17. It has been a life changer for me,” said the young man.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-ravichandran-ashwin-duplicate-mahesh-pithiya-8430200/,sports

Kamran told the media on Tuesday that he had taken retirement with immediate effect since he had also taken up coaching as a profession.

Kamran, who appeared in 268 international matches for Pakistan until 2017m was also dropped by Pakistan Super League franchise Peshawar Zalmi for the 8th season and instead signed the wicketkeeper to be on its coaching staff.
Kamran, who is the first cousin of Pakistan captain Babar Azam, made it clear he had a lot of respect for the latter’s cricketing prowess.
“He is one our great batters and my job as selector and as coach in Zalmi is to help him fine tune himself as a captain and as a batsman.

Ashwin is a quality bowler but we have tools to counter him: Steve Smith,Australian batters have been focussed on tackling the spin threat and there is a team of Indian net bowlers who is helping the visitors prepare for the four Test series.,"Australia vice-captain Steve Smith may have done a week’s simulation of Ravichadran Ashwin’s doppleganger Mahesh Pithiya but he is not overthinking about the star India spinner’s impact in the Border Gavaskar Trophy beginning here on Thursday.
Australian batters have been focussed on tackling the spin threat and there is a team of Indian net bowlers who is helping the visitors prepare for the four Test series.
Is Australia over-thinking about Ashwin? “There has been many off-spinners we played and Mahesh is one of them. He bowls a similar style (to that) of Ashwin. We are not overthinking things. Ash is a quality bowler but we have the tools in our kit bag to counter that,” Smith told reporters during a media conference.
He has had a look at the pitch and good length spot at the far end looks pretty dry.
“Pretty dry, particularly one end. I think it will take a bit of spin, particularly the left-arm spinner taking it into our left-handers. There’s a section there that’s quite dry,” he added.
But Smith also said that he won’t be over reading the track.
“Other than that, I can’t really get a good gauge on it. I don’t think there will be a heap of bounce in the wicket, I think it will be quite skiddy for the seamers and maybe a bit of up-and-down movement as the game goes on.

“The cracks felt quite loose. I’m not entirely sure – we’ll wait and see.” Smith seemed pretty happy with the preparation.

Pakistan first class cricketer Asif Afridi banned for two years,"The 36-year-old's ban has commenced from September 22, 2022 when he was provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board.","Pakistan left-arm spinner Asif Afridi, who was once selected in the national squad, was on Tuesday banned for two years after he pleaded guilty to violating an anti-corruption code.
The 36-year-old’s ban has commenced from September 22, 2022 when he was provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
He was picked for Pakistan’s white ball squad for the home T20I series against Australia but never played for the national side. Asif has 118 wickets from 36 first-class matches.
The PCB found him guilty of two breaches of the anti-corruption code for which he got a two year ban and a six month ban and both the periods of ineligibility will run concurrently.
“The PCB while handing the ban took into consideration the admission of guilt, expression of remorse, past track record and Asif Afridi’s request that the PCB considers his case compassionately, claiming he had unintentionally breached the Code,” the PCB said in a statement.
“It gives the PCB no joy to suspend an international cricketer for two years, but we have a zero-tolerance approach towards such offences,” PCB chairman Najam Sethi said.
“As the game’s governing body, we need to make examples, handle such matters robustly and send out strong messages to all cricketers.” “It is a bitter fact that corruption poses a threat to our sport as selfish corrupters lure cricketers in different ways and methods.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Australia still undecided about Lyon’s spin partner(s) for helpful Nagpur pitch,"With the surface expected to aid spin, visitors have to decide who will partner Nathan Lyon: Ashton Agar or Todd Murphy or Mitchell Swepson.","Like a doctor feeling the pulse of a patient, Nathan Lyon knelt down and moved his hand through the light-brown barren surface at the Jamtha Stadium. He would adjust his perch, probing for clues, roving for signs, and gently thud different parts of the surface to feel its firmness and dryness. After the 15-minute interaction with the pitch, he walked to the adjacent surface where his spin bowling colleagues were restlessly waiting for his diagnosis, like relatives of a patient waiting for a doctor’s diagnosis. The quartet was engaged in a brief chat, though all one could spot was Lyon talking and the others listening to him and nodding their heads like obedient students.
The veteran off-spinner would then take them to the brownest pitch on the square, which wore a bruised look after being used for three days of practice by the Indian team. He picked and marked some spots for them to hit the ball, and would observe them, like a bowling coach would. Left-arm spinner Ashton Agar erred on the fuller side and Lyon gestured at him to shorten his length a wee bit and prompted him to re-measure his run-up. Leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson found delightful drift and ripping turn that earned claps from Lyon and some others who had scattered around them.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-nathan-lyon-spin-partner-nagpur-pitch-8430156/,sports

United’s midfield linchpin Casemiro is suspended for the next three matches after being sent off in Saturday’s 2-1 win over Crystal Palace, while midfielder Scott McTominay and forwards Anthony Martial and Antony will miss the game with injuries.
Creative midfielders Christian Eriksen and Donny van de Beek are out with long-term injuries.
“We have a squad, we have many good players available in that squad, who are not always in the starting 11. So others get the chance,” Ten Hag told a news conference on Tuesday.
“After the game, I can’t say ‘Casemiro is not there, Anthony Martial is not there’. No, we have to win. This squad, all players are Man United capable, so they have to perform tomorrow and we have to win the games, no matter who is coming on the pitch.”
The manager also confirmed United had no plans to appeal the red card against Casemiro, saying the club did not believe it would be successful.
Wednesday’s match was supposed to take place last September but was postponed after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

Ten Hag’s side will play Leeds again on Sunday, aiming to continue their remarkable run of form which has lifted them to third place in the Premier League table, eight behind leaders Arsenal.
Leeds sacked American coach Jesse Marsch on Monday, a day after a 1-0 loss at Nottingham Forest extended their winless run in the league to seven matches and left them 17th in the standings on 20 points, only above the relegation zone on goal difference.
Leeds’ under-21 coach Michael Skubala will take charge of the game at Old Trafford alongside Marsch’s former assistants Paco Gallardo and Chris Armas.
Ten Hag said he was sad to learn of Marsch’s dismissal, adding that a change in coach mid-season does not usually lead to better results.

He also refused to be drawn on the charges against United’s rivals Manchester City, who the Premier League accused on Monday of more than 100 alleged breaches of finance rules.

The 37-year-old agreed to replace Roberto Martinez on a contract up to the 2026 World Cup but has been unable to sign while negotiating the balance of his contract at Bundesliga club Leipzig.
Tedesco was fired in September but is still entitled to an estimated one million euros ($1.07 million) in wages, the sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

Leipzig are currently fourth in the Bundesliga standings, four points behind leaders Bayern Munich after 19 games.
The Belgian FA had hoped for a formal announcement on the new coach to be made at the end of this week but are still waiting for Tedesco’s talks with Leipzig to be concluded.
They are confident, however, that he will have ample time to prepare for their opening Euro 2024 qualifier against Sweden in Stockholm on March 24, the sources added.

Century for Ballance on Zimbabwe debut against West Indies,"Ballance, who switched allegiance last year and has already played for Zimbabwe in limited overs internationals this year, scored 137 runs to help them declare on 379-9 in reply to West Indies' first innings tally of 447 for six declared.","Former England test batsman Gary Ballance scored an unbeaten century on debut to lead Zimbabwe in a sterling fightback on the fourth day of the first test against West Indies at the Queens Sports Club on Tuesday.
Ballance, who switched allegiance last year and has already played for Zimbabwe in limited overs internationals this year, scored 137 runs to help them declare on 379-9 in reply to West Indies’ first innings tally of 447 for six declared.
The 33-year-old left hander brought up his ton with a six over deep square leg as he and Brandon Mavuta put together a 135-run partnership for the eighth wicket, hauling Zimbabwe out of trouble after they had slumped to 192-7.
The 25-year-old Mavuta, who claimed a maiden five-wicket haul on the first two days of rain-affected play, made 56 runs before being bowled by Jason Holder on a flat deck.
Harare-born Ballance, who moved to England as a schoolboy, was able to switch allegiances under International Cricket Council rules as a player can change between two different full member nations after a three-year stand-down period.
Ballance made 23 test appearances for England between 2013 and 2017, scoring four centuries.

Rahul turned back and waved his hands, suggesting that there was no cause for any untoward alarm. Except that he was unhappy with himself for nicking off a strapping seamer, bowling from 18 yards out.

A recent visit to Padukone’s academy in Bengaluru, saw the cricket legend shower another round of affection on badminton’s latest star, and Padukone-protege, Lakshya Sen. Gavaskar, who played shuttle till a decade ago, recalled what left him mesmerized about the sport from back then.
“Prakash is the all time numero Uno for me. I will never forget the hammering he gave (twice world champion Chinese) Han Jian in Pune. When I saw his matches I only saw his feet, how the heel to toe move took place or the toes moving so swiftly to cover the court in just one or half stride. Or to jump high for the killer shot,” Gavaskar said. “The shuttle, the strokes and the opponent was in peripheral vision but my focus was only on his feet to learn how I could get my movements quicker for my game.”

"Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Cameron Green ‘unlikely’ to play against India in 1st Test, says Steve Smith",Green damaged his right index finger during the Boxing Day test win over South Africa in Melbourne and was only given clearance to return to training by his doctor on Monday following surgery.,"In a major blow to Australia, Steve Smith on Tuesday all but confirmed that fast bowling all-rounder Cameron Green is ‘unlikely’ to take part in the first Test against India on Thursday.
“I don’t think he is (going to play). I don’t think he’s even faced fast bowlers yet. So I dare say he won’t be playing but who knows. I’m not entirely sure. We’ll wait and see. But it’s unlikely, I think,” he said at a pre-match press conference.
Green damaged his right index finger during the Boxing Day test win over South Africa in Melbourne and was only given clearance to return to training by his doctor on Monday following surgery.
Talking about the prospect of partnering Nathan Lyon and other spinners like Ashton Agar, Todd Murphy and Mitchell Swepson, Smith said: “Possibly. If Greeny was fit, it would be definitely more of an option. Without him I’m not entirely sure. We’ve got a strategy meeting where we’ll talk about what we think. Ultimately it’s down to the selectors to pick the team they think is best for the surface.”
Earlier on Tuesday, former Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist had rooted for Green’s place in Australia’s playing XI for the first Test. Gilchrist said that Green should play against India – despite the all-rounder being unable to bowl.
Backing Green for the no.6 position, Gilchrist said Green is still deserving of his spot.”I think they’ll start with Green at six, assuming he’s fully fit and not hindered by that finger injury at all,” Gilchrist said on SEN’s podcast.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/cameron-green-unlikely-to-play-against-india-in-1st-test-steve-smith-8429895/,sports
Yorkshire admit four charges after investigation into racism claims,"Yorkshire and a number of individuals were charged by the ECB in June after an investigation into racism claims made by former player Azeem Rafiq, who alleged in 2021 that he had been a victim of institutional racism at the club.","Yorkshire County Cricket Club has admitted liability to four amended charges including a failure to address and take adequate action against racist and discriminatory language, the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Tuesday.
Yorkshire and a number of individuals were charged by the ECB in June after an investigation into racism claims made by former player Azeem Rafiq, who alleged in 2021 that he had been a victim of institutional racism at the club.
The scandal rocked English cricket and led to numerous changes in coaching and administrative personnel at Yorkshire.
“Yorkshire CCC has admitted liability in response to four amended charges, including a failure to address systemic use of racist and/or discriminatory language over a prolonged period and a failure to take adequate action in respect of allegations of racist and/or discriminatory behaviour,” the ECB said.
Rafiq’s former team mate Gary Ballance, who played 23 tests for England before switching allegiance to Zimbabwe, also admitted liability for his use of racially discriminatory language, the ECB added.
Rafiq, a former England Under-19s captain of Pakistani descent, told a British parliamentary committee in 2021 of “inhuman” treatment at Yorkshire and described the sport in England as riddled with racism.
Ballance has previously apologised to Rafiq in person for using racist language.

Both Yorkshire and Ballance will not be required to attend a hearing in London following the acceptance of the charges.
An independent panel of the Cricket Discipline Commission, the body that handles disciplinary matters in the English domestic game, will hear the cases from March 1 to March 9.
Ex-Yorkshire players Tim Bresnan, John Blain, Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Gale and Richard Pyrah have all withdrawn from the hearing.
“Today’s announcement is an important step forward for Yorkshire County Cricket Club as part of its journey to learn from the past,” Yorkshire chairman Kamlesh Patel said in a statement.

Ancelotti says abuse of Vinicius Jr is problem for all Spanish football,"Vinicius received racist abuse from fans in Mallorca on Sunday during an ill-tempered match in which the Brazilian was fouled 10 times, the most for any player in LaLiga this season.","Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Tuesday that the abuse that has been directed at his player Vinicius Jr is a problem for the whole of Spanish football, not for the 22-year-old Brazilian.
Vinicius received racist abuse from fans in Mallorca on Sunday during an ill-tempered match in which the Brazilian was fouled 10 times, the most for any player in LaLiga this season.
Vinicius has been subjected to racial abuse by fans on at least three other occasions and is the most fouled player in Europe’s top seven leagues by a big margin.
“It seems that the problem is Vinicius, and it is not like that. It is a problem of Spanish football and it must be solved,” Ancelotti told a news conference in Rabat on Tuesday, on the eve of Real Madrid’s Club World Cup semi-final against Egypt’s Al Ahly.
“The question I ask is this: Is it Vinicius or his team mates? What do his team mates have to defend Vinicius from? Vinicius is the victim of something that I don’t understand.”
Supporters in Mallorca could be heard racially insulting the player in a video published by streaming company DAZN on social media on Sunday.
Spanish police are also investigating a possible hate crime against the Brazilian after a mannequin wearing his No. 20 shirt was hung from a bridge in front of the club’s training centre ahead of the Madrid derby two weeks ago.
ADVERTISEMENT
The mannequin was hung by the neck next to a banner in Atletico Madrid’s red and white colours that read “Madrid hates Real” during the early hours of Jan. 26, police said.
In September, prosecutors in Madrid decided not to press charges over racist chanting aimed at Vinicius after finding it had “lasted a few seconds” and had not constituted a crime.
Pele, Neymar and other leading Brazilian figures defended Vinicius in September after a panelist on a Spanish soccer show compared his goal celebrations to that of a monkey, sparking an immediate backlash on social media.
Vinicius issued a video statement at the time in response to what he called a “xenophobic and racist” insult, saying he “won’t stop dancing” and that “the happiness of a black Brazilian being successful in Europe bothers” many people.
ADVERTISEMENT
In December, the player accused LaLiga of continuing to do nothing about racist fans at matches, after videos on social media showed some shouting abuse and throwing objects at him during a match the previous day in Valladolid.
“On the issue of racism, I think that is people that are bitter with their own lives who go in the stands and try to pay for their frustrations with a 22-year-old kid. You have to have respect for other people,” Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde told a news conference on Tuesday.

Australia could win Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2-1: Duminy,"India will be without two of its key players in Rishabh Pant and Jasprit Bumrah, but premier all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja will be back to the action after a knee surgery.","Playing at home, India will go into the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as favourites but former South African JP Duminy says Australia could trump the hosts 2-1 in the much anticipated Test rubber.
India will be without two of its key players in Rishabh Pant and Jasprit Bumrah, but premier all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja will be back to the action after a knee surgery.
The Test series will begin on Thursday in Nagpur.
“I see it as a very close series, but I genuinely think that Australia stand a good chance. They certainly have been the team to beat,” Duminy said during a virtual interaction, facilitated by SA T20, where he coaches Paarl Royals team.
“I feel it would be 2-1 to Australia and for me the Player-of-The-Series would be Usman Khawaja,” he said of the Australian left-hander, who hit a career-best unbeaten 195 against South Africa in Sydney Test in January.
Duminy was quick to add that one can never “write off” India in their home conditions.
“You think about (Ravichandran) Ashwin who has a prolific Test record in India, he’s probably going to be the key for them.” “When it comes to Test cricket, you have got to utilise your resources. Guys like (Cheteshwar) Pujara, Virat Kohli who are prolific in Test cricket. They churn out runs after runs. It’s an opportunity for those guys to step up.
India’s ‘Mr 360’, Suryakumar Yadav has been in sensational form in T20 format and is part of the Test squad.
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked whether he’s primed for a Test debut, Duminy said: “Probably he’s one of the most exciting players for India right now. From the way Test cricket is going, as a country you need to decide what is the line of cricket you would be playing. And if it’s of the attacking mindset, then he becomes an option, certainly.” There has already been a debate over whether India play to their strength and prepare rank-turners for the upcoming four-Test series. Duminy feels it’s absolutely fair to play to your advantage.
“That’s the beauty of having a home series. You have the opportunity to play to your advantage. Why would you not. It would be silly to think that you would not want to utilise that (rank-turners) in your favour.
“I certainly see that will be the case in the series. Whenever you travel to the Sub-continent that’s always something you face. You need to be able to prepare for that. If you want to be the best in the world, you have to be able to perform in all conditions,” he asserted.
Pandya can become a great player for India across formats
ADVERTISEMENT
Ace India all-rounder Hardik Pandya is seen as a white-ball maverick but Duminy sees no reason why Pandya cannot become an all-format player? “I’m always going to advocate all formats if the player has the ability to influence the game. I’ve played with him as well, and I think he has the ability to be a great player for India across all formats. I would certainly encourage him to do (play) all formats.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-could-win-border-gavaskar-trophy-2-1-duminy-8429736/,sports

There’s temptation to play three spinners but you never know with Nagpur pitch: KL Rahul,"With less than 48 hours left for the Border Gavaskar Trophy to begin, Rahul didn't provide any definitive answers about three key slots in the team -- the wicketkeeper, the third spinner and the number five in the batting order.","India’s Test vice-captain KL Rahul feels it’s never easy to predict the nature of a track but there is a “temptation” to play three spinners in the first Test against Australia, beginning here on Thursday.
With less than 48 hours left for the Border Gavaskar Trophy to begin, Rahul didn’t provide any definitive answers about three key slots in the team — the wicketkeeper, the third spinner and the number five in the batting order.
Asked if Shubman Gill will bat in the middle-order, Rahul said: “We still haven’t decided on the final XI. It’s going to be a tough decision to make. There are guys who have performed exceedingly well and there are a few spots open so there are a few discussions going on and the players are being spoken to.” The VCA track is expected to assist spinners from day one itself but Rahul doesn’t want to be a soothsayer when it comes to reading the 22-yard strip.
“Yes, we did see it (the pitch), but it’s still too early to really know what the pitch is going to do. We need to come here on the day of the match to know how it’s really going to play,” he told reporters.
“We can only look at it and assume it’s going to play a certain way, but you never know with pitches. Yes, there is the temptation to play three spinners because we’re playing in India. We’ll take that call on the day of the game or the day before the game,” the stylish right-hander said.
With skipper Rohit Sharma back in the mix, Rahul was asked if he would like to bat in the middle-order where he had started his Test career back in 2014.
“If it arises, then I’m more than happy to do that. Whatever little cricket I’ve played for the country, I’ve always done that.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Whatever the team has asked me to do, I try and prepare that way and try and do my best for the team, and if that is something that the team wants me to do here, I’ll be more than happy to do it,” Rahul said, although it is unlikely that he would come down the order.
So does he find it unique that there is no straightforward choice for picking the playing eleven this time around? “I don’t know if it has happened before but, yes, this time is is going to be tough. Tough decision to select an eleven. All the 15 guys in the side are top quality, and that’s why they’re here. Anyone of them on any given day can be a match winner…
“The playing XI, we always try and make a decision based on what’s best for the team and for that particular Test match. We have done that over the last two years,” that was his response to a PTI query.
Rahul didn’t forget to remind the media that he is still pretty sour about the backlash that he got for dropping Kuldeep Yadav for the second Test against Bangladesh after his match-winning performance in the series opener.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There have been questions about why a certain player has played… even in Bangladesh, I remember, Kuldeep (Yadav) got the man of the match and did not play the next Test.
“Obviously, the only reason, or the only thinking, behind such decisions is which player fits the role for that particular condition.
“You said, I have played for 10 years, but even if I have played for 20-30 years, and even after retirement, there is nobody who can look at the pitch and say accurately that ‘this is how it is going to play’.
“It’s really based on some experience and a little bit of history of that place. Even in this series, that’s something we will continue to do,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Whether it is Suryakumar Yadav or Kuldeep Yadav, whoever gets dropped needs to take that on chin.
“Everyone is very clear about why they’re playing, why they aren’t playing, their roles in the team. That’s a good thing, and the atmosphere in the team is very good.” Reverse swing will play a huge role
Rahul feels with the quality in the Australian bowling line-up, reverse swing in the dry and abrasive conditions can play a huge role.
“It always plays a huge role in India. We have seen that historically as well. Any team that has quality fast bowlers who can exploit reverse swing will be dangerous on pitches like these. That’s something that we have tried to prepare for over the last week, 10 days.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We all know the Australian team has always produced high-quality fast bowlers, and we know the threat they can pose. That’s the beauty of playing against Australia, that’s what excites you and something we are kicked about.” With David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Travis Head, Alex Carey and Matt Renshaw in the mix, the southpaw heavy Aussie line-up may just given an advantage to the home team.
“I think it will help our bowlers a little bit. If there are two left-handers together, and left-handers are coming in to bat, back-to-back, that will only mean that the bowlers get time to settle into a certain line and length.
“That also is a very unique thing. I don’t think any other team has that many left-handers…”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/theres-temptation-to-play-three-spinners-but-you-never-know-with-nagpur-pitch-kl-rahul-8429645/,sports

"Siraj, Shubman nominated for ICC Player of the Month Award","New Zealand opener Devon Conway, who has had a fine start to the year with three hundreds and two fifties across formats, is the third contender for the award.","India pacer Mohammed Siraj and opener Shubman Gill were on Tuesday nominated for the ICC Player of the Month Award for their stellar show in January.
New Zealand opener Devon Conway, who has had a fine start to the year with three hundreds and two fifties across formats, is the third contender for the award.
Following a fruitful 2022, Gill displayed his batting prowess in both the white-ball formats last month while Siraj led India’s fast-bowling attack with distinction in ODIs in recent times, showcasing his brilliance consistently, especially with the new ball in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah. Gill was handed his maiden T20I cap in the first match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, where he managed just seven, before another single-digit score in the second game. He made a steady 46 in the third T20I in Rajkot.
Gill then registered scores of 70, 21 and 116 in the three ODIs against the island nation, but it was his breathtaking display in the first ODI against New Zealand in Hyderabad that stole the show.
The 23-year-old struck 208 off 149 balls in an incredible knock on a day when none of his teammates crossed 28.
Gill got to 200 with three consecutive sixes off Lockie Ferguson, and with it, became the youngest player to the milestone in ODIs.
He backed that up with scores of 40 not out and 112 in his next two outings to close out the series with an aggregate of 360, the joint-highest for anyone in a three-match ODI series, equalling Babar Azam’s record against the West Indies in 2016-17.
ADVERTISEMENT
Siraj’s incredible form, on the other hand, was rewarded in the ICC Men’s Player Rankings, where he was crowned the No.1 bowler in ODIs.
He returned with figures of 2/30 from seven overs in a high-scoring first ODI against Sri Lanka in Guwahati and backed it up with figures of 3/30 and 4/32 in his next two outings respectively to finish as the leading wicket-taker in the series.

Sneh Rana jumps to career-best sixth in ICC T20I bowlers’ ranking,"Off-spinner Rana advanced four places after taking two for 21 in the Tri-Series final against South Africa, which also featured the West Indies.","India’s Sneh Rana jumped four spots to a career-best sixth place while compatriot Deepti Sharma slipped a place down to third among bowlers in the latest ICC Women’s T20I Player Rankings issued on Tuesday.
Off-spinner Rana advanced four places after taking two for 21 in the Tri-Series final against South Africa, which also featured the West Indies.
South Africa left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba dislodged Deepti from the earlier second position after a fine performance against India in the final of the Tri-series.
Mlaba grabbed two for 16 in the final in East London to finish with six wickets in the Tri-Series which came at just 8.66 runs apiece and she conceded just 3.25 runs per over to move to a career-best 753 rating points, just 10 points behind England’s Sophie Ecclestone, another left-arm spinner.
Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (up one place to 10th), Deepti Sharma (up two places to 23rd) and Harleen Deol (up 20 places to 110th) are among those to move up the list for batters in the last update to the rankings ahead of the Women’s T20 World Cup beginning on Friday.
South Africa all-rounder Chloe Tryon is the main mover with the bat, following her unbeaten 57 in the final, which also won her the Player of the Match award.

Australia batters Tahlia McGrath and Beth Mooney are looking at potential milestones. McGrath could achieve the highest points tally by a batter in the women’s T20I batting rankings as she is just 40 adrift of Charlotte Edwards’s record of 843 achieved in June 2009.
Mooney could become only the second Australian to reach 800 batting rating points after McGrath.

When Lanning asked Cummins on who in the men’s team drives success, the speedster said, “Ideally it’s everyone. The players challenge each other. You see someone like Steve Smith, he is batting out there for hours in the nets while Marnus will go in and bat with him for hours.”
“It is really healthy competition seeing them,” he added.
When Lanning was asked about someone who made a difference in her skill development she credited her batting coach and said, “For me, It’s my batting coach Steve Maddocks. He was not about techniques…all we spoke about was about scoring runs and that resonated really well with me.”
Discussing the role of technology in their captaincy, the two reckoned that it plays a pivotal role in modern cricket. Cummins said that playing in different countries, the data really helps figure out which players are best suited for the given pitch and conditions.
“Getting the ball tracking data and looking at the data, the same movement, the swing, the speed on the wicket, the amount of spin, that’s really, really good data.”

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Throwback to Ravindra Jadeja’s devastating spell with ball in 2017 Bengaluru Test,Ravindra Jadeja has been out of national team since August last year due to a right knee injury which he sustained during the Asia Cup.,"It’s been a “frustrating” last few months for Ravindra Jadeja, who has been out of the national team since August last year due to a right knee injury which he sustained during the Asia Cup. But when the Border-Gavaskar Trophy starts with the first Test in Nagpur from Thursday, Jadeja is expected to be one of the key weapons in India’s arsenal, particularly with it seeming likely that all four Tests could be played on spin-friendly wickets.
But just how lethal he can be when on song was perfectly summed up when he spun a web around the Australian batters, claiming six wickets for 63 runs in the second Test of the 2017 Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. These included the crucial wickets of Steve Smith and Peter Handscomb. Australia had claimed the first Test in Pune. But thanks to Jadeja’s efforts with the ball, India managed to level the series in Bengaluru with a 75-run margin and then went on to claim the series in the fourth Test at Dharamsala.

"The Premier League’s charges against Manchester City, explained",Manchester City says it has done nothing wrong and declared itself “surprised” at the airing of what it referred to as “alleged breaches.” The Premier League’s statement suggests its thick rule book views the case quite differently.,"By Tariq Panja and Andrew Das
The Premier League has accused Manchester City of more than 100 violations of its financial regulations, a laundry list of rules breaches that it says began more than a decade ago and continue to present day.
Manchester City says it has done nothing wrong and declared itself “surprised” at the airing of what it referred to as “alleged breaches.” The Premier League’s statement suggests its thick rule book views the case quite differently.
The looming showdown over the charges promises to be a monumental fight, matching the Premier League, one of the world’s richest sporting competitions, against Manchester City, one of the dominant clubs of soccer’s modern era (and one with seemingly bottomless financial resources).
But what are the accusations? What violations do they refer to specifically? And if they’re true, what potential punishment does City face?
What is the case about?
Broadly, the Premier League has accused Manchester City of repeatedly failing to provide accurate financial information “that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position, in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs.”
City also stands accused of not disclosing contractual payments to managers and players — presumably to hide the true costs of building one of the world’s best teams — and of failing, as required, to abide by the financial control mechanisms set by the league but also UEFA, European soccer’s governing body. It is also accused of not cooperating with Premier League investigators.

What has all that money delivered?
More than a decade of relentless success, to start. Manchester City had won two English top-division titles in its history — in 1937 and 1968 — before its Gulf owners arrived in 2008. In more than a decade since, the club has claimed six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, six league cups and a berth in the 2021 Champions League final. Over that period, City has been — in the most literal sense of the phrase — one of the best teams money could buy anywhere on earth.
What kind of punishment is it facing?
To be clear, City has only been accused of financial rules violations at this point.
If the club is found to have breached the rules, however, the Premier League lays out sanctions that could include business penalties like reprimands and fines and — far more worrisome if you’re City — points deductions in the standings or even expulsion from the top division.
That feels like a big deal.
ADVERTISEMENT
Expelling City from the Premier League would be a very big deal. Rewriting the league’s record books, and its title history, would be just as big. Manchester City has spent billions building a serial Premier League champion and annual Champions League contender. Losing any of it in the stroke of a pen would be astonishing.
Explain the charges to me like I’m a child.
The Premier League laid out its accusations against Manchester City in five points littered with legalese and references to rules like B.13, C.71, C.72 and C.75 (amended to C.79).
Let’s simplify them:
The first point contends that for every season from 2009-10 to 2017-18, Manchester City failed to abide by rules requiring member clubs to provide accurate financial information to the league, giving it “a true and fair view” of the club’s revenues (think sponsorships) and operating costs (think salaries).
ADVERTISEMENT
What does that mean? All Premier League clubs sign up to a code of compliance, promising to behave as good-faith actors and provide up-to-date and true versions of their accounts to be audited every year. City has long faced accusations that it has inflated the value of its sponsorship deals with entities linked to its Gulf owners, including with the United Arab Emirates’ national airline, Etihad, and the telecommunications company Etisalat.
Another set of charges suggests that, in the Premier League’s view, Manchester City was not truthful in its reporting of contracts detailing the compensation of its manager and certain players in several seasons.

What you might not know: City is accused of reducing the cost of player and coach salaries by paying portions of them through third parties or secret agreements, an allegation that first emerged when the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported that Manchester City’s former coach Roberto Mancini actually had signed two contracts when he joined the club in 2009. The first paid him 1.45 million pounds (about $1.7 million) to coach Manchester City. The secondary agreement paid him slightly more to consult with a UAE-based team, Al Jazira, for only four days a year. Manchester City’s chair, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, is also chair of the company that owns Al Jazira.
The Premier League’s financial rules require that all member clubs comply not only with those regulations but also with the so-called financial fair play regulations of UEFA, the sport’s European governing body. For the seasons from 2013 to 2018, the Premier League contends, Manchester City was in violation of those requirements.

We’ve been here before. In 2020, UEFA hit Manchester City with a two-season ban from European competition, a suspension that would have kept City from playing in the lucrative and hugely popular Champions League. City, however, had the judgment overturned on a technicality: It successfully argued at the Court of Arbitration for Sport that the most serious allegations — linked to its sponsorship agreements with Etisalat and Etihad — were outside UEFA’s statute of limitations. Essentially, the club argued (and won), it was too late to punish them.

One of the more serious accusations against City is that it did not cooperate with the investigations into its actions, including providing documents and information. In the Premier League’s view, this lack of cooperation covers the entirety of its investigation, which is now in its fifth year, and extends to current day.
To turn over, or not to turn over. City was perhaps most indignant about this set of charges in its response Monday, “particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.” But the Premier League’s claim is one that was previously made by UEFA, and upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and evidence of the league’s struggles to get City to fully cooperate has already emerged. Several years ago, City sued the Premier League, asking a court to block efforts to force it to turn over crucial documents. City lost that case, as well as an attempt to block the publication of the judge’s findings in the case once it was over.
What’s next?
The Premier League said, in following its rules, it had referred the accusations against City to an independent commission. That body will take the case to a confidential hearing — read: private, no media (but expect leaks) — and then the Premier League will publish the commission’s final decision on its website. City and the Premier League can appeal the judgment, which would be heard by a similar panel convened by Murray Rosen, a lawyer who heads the Premier League’s judicial panel. News reports have said Rosen is a member at Arsenal, City’s closest rival for this season’s title.

‘They are scared of foreign coaches; don’t respect Pakistan coaches’: Sikander Bakht blasts Pakistan players,Bakht worked as a support staff for the Pakistan cricket team between 2000 and 2003. He has also been a national selector.,"Former Pakistan player and coach Sikander Bakht has blasted the Pakistan players for not respecting Pakistan-origin coaches.
Bakht worked as a support staff for the Pakistan cricket team between 2000 and 2003. He has also been a national selector.
“I had once tried to tell a Pakistan player when I was involved with the Pakistan team. He said, “You have just played 26 Tests for Pakistan. I have played 40. You are trying to tell me? I am saying this on oath. This is the approach of players. You think a cricketer can go and say something to Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, Shadab Khan ? … The players behave well with foreign coaches. Take Mickey Arthur, he hasn’t played a single international game but he is good with man management,” Bakht told Geo News.
Because he’s a foreigner, they are scared of him (voh angrez hai, and yeh darte hain), Bakht said.

We have had a lot of coaches from Pakistan. Be it Javed Miandad, Waqar Younis, Saqlain Mushtaq, Mohammad Yousuf – but they couldn’t handle. I will take an example of a player without taking his name, who works with me on Geo. He told me that he prays every day that he is not given any role with PCB. There are so many difficulties and pressure there that I pray in every namaz that I don’t be given a job with PCB,” Bakht said.
Pakistan’s former captain Shahid Afridi has said that “he does not quite understand how online coaching will work in the Pakistan team” after reports emerged that former coach Mickey Arthur will take charge as online coach of the national team. The former interim selector also batted for home grown coaches instead of foreign ones to manage the national team.
In a video shared by, Paktv.tv, Afridi can be heard saying, “Well even I don’t know what type of coaching will happen or what the plan is. I don’t understand this online system of coaching”
“Why only foreign coaches? Pakistan do have good coaches here. I know PCB also takes into consideration where the person is presently involved in politics. But all those should be kept aside in cricket so that we get a person who can take the tough calls which eventually makes a good team. We have people here who can lead the team. What is coaching? It’s just man management.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/they-are-scared-of-foreign-coaches-dont-respect-pakistan-coaches-sikander-bakht-blasts-pakistan-players-8428593/,sports
‘It’s good for cricket if Asia Cup venue is shifted out of Pakistan’: Abdul Razzaq,"When the host said should India be stopped from hosting big tournaments if they continue to pick-and-choose, Razzaq disagreed.","Former Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq struck a pragmatic tone while discussing the change of venue for Asia Cup, urging that it’s “good for cricket” if it gets shifted to another venue, out of Pakistan.
“It’s good for cricket. And for cricket promotion. India-Pakistan games only happen in ICC tournaments. If Asia Cup has been shifted to Dubai, then it’s best option. It’s good for cricket and cricketers,” Razzaq told Geo News.
When the host said should India be stopped from hosting big tournaments if they continue to pick-and-choose, Razzaq disagreed.
“It doesn’t happen like this. This has been on for years. If the two boards sit across table and chat, it would be great. Both boards should solve this issue.”
A former PCB chairman Khaled Mahmood was disappointed with India’s stance but was realistic. He urged the PCB to start speaking to other members of the ICC.
“The world doesn’t run on ideology and principles; else ICC should show their power and tell India ‘who are you not to go and play Asia Cup in Pakistan?’ But India has great influence on ICC.
If We host Asia Cup without India and without their players, corporate sponsorship will all stop. The big money will stop. And it won’t be a glamorous tournament without them. It would be a weak tournament. We will also lose money.”
ADVERTISEMENT
If things aren’t going to change, then we have to be pragmatic about this. The PCB will have to accept the change of venue and our players get the chance to play.
Mahmood said it should be stressed to Indian board that they are doing wrong. “We should lobby the issue with other members – England, Australia. At least, it should be known that things are getting out of control, India are doing wrong – and you guys are sitting quietly. There is no use sitting and talking just with India. That’s been done. It’s time to go to other members.”
When the host said that Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja’s visa to India was also delayed presumably because he was born in Pakistan, Mahmood took a potshot at Australia.
“Did Australian board threaten India, ask them harsh questions when Usman Khawaja’s visa was delayed? They should have been harsher, and taken action. All of them were just quiet.”

On Monday, Indian cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin too had his say on the Asia Cup issue.
“But we would have seen this happen many times, right? When we say Asia Cup won’t go to their place, they will say that they will also not come to our place,” Ashwin said in a video on his YouTube channel. “The final call might be that the Asia Cup will be moved to Sri Lanka. This an important lead-up to the 50-over World Cup. Many tournaments have taken place in Dubai. I would also be pleased if it is moved to Sri Lanka,” Ashwin said.
Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad had earlier dissed India for their stance.
“India can go to hell if they don’t want to come to Pakistan to play cricket,” the 65-year-old said at a recent public event. “I’ve always backed Pakistan. And you know that I don’t leave spare India whenever an issue arises. But the thing is we need to look at our part. And we should fight for it. We don’t care because we are getting to host our cricket. This is ICC’s job. If ICC can’t control this there’s no use of the governing body. They need to implement similar rules for every team. If teams like these don’t come, they should be debarred. India hoga, apne liye hoga. Hamare liye nahi hai.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/its-good-for-cricket-if-asia-cup-venue-is-shifted-out-of-pakistan-abdul-razzaq-8428552/,sports

"Border Gavaskar Trophy: ‘Cameron Green should be in Australia Playing XI as a batter only’, says Adam Gilchrist",Cameron Green damaged his right index finger during the Boxing Day test win over South Africa in Melbourne and was only given clearance to return to training by his doctor on Monday following surgery.,"Former Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist has rooted for Cameron Green’s place in Australia’s playing XI for the first Test against India at Nagpur. Gilchrist has said that Green should play against India – despite the all-rounder being unable to bowl.
Green damaged his right index finger during the Boxing Day test win over South Africa in Melbourne and was only given clearance to return to training by his doctor on Monday following surgery.
Backing Green for the no.6 position, Gilchrist said Green is still deserving of his spot.”I think they’ll start with Green at six, assuming he’s fully fit and not hindered by that finger injury at all,” Gilchrist said on SEN’s podcast.
“The way he played in Sri Lanka, it almost looks like Green develops before our eyes every time he plays a game of cricket… I reckon the steps forward he took in Sri Lanka, they’ll be hoping he can keep that process going,” said Gilchrist who was the last touring Australian captain to record a series win in India.
The 23-year-old all-rounder has played 18 Tests averaging 35.04 with the bat and hogged attention in three innings in Sri Lanka last year.
The Aussie side-led by Pat Cummins will face India without pacers like Mitch Starc and Josh Hazlewood. Scott Boland is set to be the second pace option alongside captain Pat Cummins. Green was set to provide another seam option as an addition to his batting abilities, but his bowling absence could force the Aussies into a rejig.

Miandad has staunchly criticised the BCCI for their rigid stance on not touring Pakistan for the 2023 Asia Cup.
“But we would have seen this happen many times, right? When we say Asia Cup won’t go to their place, they will say that they will also not come to our place,” Ashwin said in a video on his YouTube channel.

"LeBron James chasing wins, not record, teammates say","The mood was relaxed as practice wrapped up on a sunsoaked Southern California day, but the large number of reporters on hand made it clear that excitement to see James surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's tally of 38,387 points was intensifying.","LeBron James may be on the verge of breaking one of the most coveted records in sports, but his teammates said his focus is on helping the Lakers climb in the standings and not the 36 points he needs to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer.
The mood was relaxed as practice wrapped up on a sunsoaked Southern California day, but the large number of reporters on hand made it clear that excitement to see James surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s tally of 38,387 points was intensifying.
“It’s exciting,” Lakers guard Austin Reaves said.
“You are not going to see this for a while. Someone who’s able to play for this long and be as productive as he’s been since day one.
“Everybody is excited for him, but we’re still trying to win games and hopefully we do that the same night he breaks the record.”
The Lakers are 25-29 and 13th in the Western Conference standings but just four games off the number four seed.
James, who is averaging 30 points a game in his 20th season, will get his first chance at the historic accomplishment on Tuesday when the Lakers host the Oklahoma City Thunder.
If he comes up short, he will have another opportunity to reach the mountaintop at home on Thursday against the Milwaukee Bucks.

“At the end of the day he’s not going to change the way he plays, he just wants to win games,” Reaves said. “So if it happens tomorrow or if it happens the next game, as long as we’re winning, I think that’s the main thing that he’s worried about.”

Fast bowler Pat Cummins became captain of Australia’s ODI team when Finch retired from the one-day format last October to focus on T20 cricket. Cricket Australia hasn’t announced a replacement for the T20 team.
Australia was dominant in the traditional one-day format, winning four of the last six World Cups, but wasn’t able to convert that into the T20 version of the game until Finch’s squad won an against-the-odds title in the United Arab Emirates in late 2021.
In all, Finch played 146 ODIs at an average of almost 39, and 103 T20 internationals at an average of 34.28 and a strike-rate of 142.53. He has twice held the record for highest score in a T20 international, posting 156 against England in 2013 and then setting the current mark of 172 against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2018.

"Juventus need 40 points to avoid relegation, says Allegri","Juventus were deducted 15 points for the current season by an Italian football court investigating the club's transfer dealings in January, leaving the country's most successful team marooned in mid-table.","Juventus are concentrating on just making sure they get enough points to avoid relegation from Serie A, coach Massimiliano Allegri said, as his side reassess their season having been in third place a couple a weeks ago.
Juventus were deducted 15 points for the current season by an Italian football court investigating the club’s transfer dealings in January, leaving the country’s most successful team marooned in mid-table.
The club are now 13th in the standings with 23 points, ten above the relegation zone.
“Right now the fact is that we have been deducted 15 points and we have to think about reaching the 40-point mark. It’s ironic, but we need to think about this objective first and then take it step by step,” Allegri told reporters on Monday ahead of the league trip to Salernitana on Tuesday.
“For us, the important thing is to face the match with the right approach. We must put ourselves on a par with Salernitana. We have to get back on track and set about catching the teams ahead of us and start climbing the table.
“Tomorrow’s match will be complicated. Their fans are passionate, (manager Davide) Nicola is doing a great job there and they are coming off a (2-1) victory in Lecce.”
Allegri also said that most of the squad are available for the match except a couple of players.

“All the players are available apart from (Leonardo) Bonucci who has the flu, (Paul) Pogba who is recovering and (Leandro) Paredes who has a niggle,” he said.
Juve still have a chance of collecting some silverware this season as they remain in the Coppa Italia and Europa League.
“It’s a long season and we have to continue our journey. We are in the semi-final of the Coppa Italia and our aim is to progress in the Europa League as well,” Allegri added.

When Australia ‘rushed’ Pat Cummins’s return to Tests and he proved his durability,The fast bowler himself had thought it was too early for him to get back into the Test arena. But the 39 overs he bowled on the placid Ranchi surface in 2017 helped him throw off the shackles of his injury-ridden past.,"When Australia picked Pat Cummins to replace the injured Mitchell Starc for the last two Tests of their four-match series in India in 2017, there was no wholesome approval from the Australian cricket fraternity. In fact, the fast bowler himself had said the India tour would have been too soon for him to return to Test cricket.
Cricket Australia, in a way, was going against its own plans for managing the talented but injury-prone fast bowler’s career. After the seven-wicket, player-of-the-match performance as an 18-year-old on his debut against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2011, Cummins was yet to add to his Test caps. Repeated stress fractures had taken a toll on him but the Australian cricket establishment was willing to give Cummins, more precisely his bones, the time to mature.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/when-australia-rushed-pat-cumminss-return-to-tests-and-he-proved-his-durability-8427915/,sports

Asked to field, the Indian bowlers blew away the Australian top order but tail-enders Georgia Wareham (32) and Jess Jonassen’s (22) unbeaten 50-run partnership powered Australia to 129 for 8.
In reply, the Indian batters were skittled out for 85 in 15 overs.
It was the second consecutive time that batting has let down India. The ‘Women in Blue’ had suffered a similar collapse in the Tri-Series final last week against South Africa.
Pacer Darcie Brown (4/17) was the wrecker-in-chief as she cleaned up the Indian top order, taking the vital scalps of Shafali Verma (2), Smriti Mandhana (0) and Richa Ghosh (5).
The woeful run of Jemimah Rodrigues, who opened the innings alongside Shafali, continued as she was out on nought while skipper Harmanpreet Kaur did not bat.
Harleen Doel (12) showed some intent, hitting two fours before succumbing to a run out while Deepti Sharma was the top scorer as the all-rounder remained unbeaten on 19. She could have taken India over the line had someone stayed with her till the end.

Earlier, veteran pacer Shikha Pandey (2/9) struck in her first two overs to send Australia skipper Meg Lanning (0) and Tahlia McGrath (2) packing.
A run out by Radha Yadav spelt the end of Ellyse Perry (1) as Australia were reeling at 10 for 3.
Ash Gardner (22) and Beth Mooney (28) provided some resistance but Pooja Vastrakar (2/16) and Radha Yadav (2/22) ran through the middle order.
Renuka Singh, who had an off day, was the most expensive bowler for India, giving away 39 runs in three overs.

The reward: India getting their hands on the inaugural Under-19 World Cup trophy on January 29, defeating England in the final.
While Nooshin was looking for a breather, she is getting to experience what it feels to be part of a team that became the first women’s team to bring an ICC title home – a completion of a well-deserved redemption arc. Nooshin was, in fact, the final Indian batter to have gotten out in the 2005 Women’s ODI World Cup final against Australia, giving the Aussies the fifth of their seven titles.

Leeds hasn’t won any of its last seven games in the league and has dropped into 17th place in the 20-team division, only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.
Marsch’s last game was a 1-0 loss at Nottingham Forest on Sunday, after which he said he understood the frustrations of fans calling for his dismissal and underlined there was a belief inside the club that results would improve.
#LUFC can confirm head coach Jesse Marsch has been relieved of his duties
— Leeds United (@LUFC) February 6, 2023
The 49-year-old Marsch was hired in February last year as a replacement for Marcelo Bielsa, who was manager for 3 1/2 years and got Leeds promoted to the Premier League after an absence of 16 years.
Under Marsch, Leeds preserved its Premier League status on the final day of last season but has struggled again during this campaign and is without a win since Nov. 5 — before the World Cup.
“We would like to thank Jesse and his backroom staff for their efforts and wish them well for the future,” Leeds said in a short statement, adding that the process of hiring a new manager was underway.
Marsch had 37 games as Leeds manager and won 11 of them.
Among the club’s four signings in the January transfer window was Weston McKennie, a midfielder whose arrival took the contingent of U.S. players to three after Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams.

Pooja turned provider in the 37th minute when her shot from the right was saved by the opposition keeper. However, she got on the rebound and sent it in for Shilji to score her second.

“When you are playing a World Cup and suddenly the spotlight is on you, things will be different but it’s important you have a mentor with you, it can be a coach, a friend or parents,” Jhulan said at a Sportstar event.
“Their role is very important — to make sure that the player is fit on the ground because they have huge talent and suddenly they are getting all the spotlight.” Jhulan, who retired from the game last year, will serve as a team mentor and bowling coach of the Mumbai Indians franchise in the WPL.
“And after the WPL start, they will earn money in this age. They need to be guided properly, in the right direction. This is where the journey begins and we cannot lose out on talent because we want them to be match winners for the country.
“I’ll suggest them, work hard and spend time on the field and cricket will take care of the rest. It’s going to be an exciting time but it will be a huge challenge because the spotlight will be on you. It will challenging for the youngsters.” She urged the state associations to also take pro-active measures.

On Monday, Ganguly was a guest at the Sportstar East Sports Conclave where he talked about the meeting and Dhoni’s contribution in general to Indian cricket.
“When you speak about MS Dhoni, it’s not about the matches he has played but what impact he has had on Indian cricket. I met him a couple of days ago in Mumbai. We both were shooting. He is an absolute champion. One of the all-time greats of Indian cricket, winning World Cups, coming from the state of Ranchi which hardly produced any players and I feel proud that two of India’s very successful captains came from the parts of the country where people thought cricket wasn’t at its best,” Ganguly said.

Border Gavaskar Trophy: Four interesting Test records of India vs Australia rivalry,The Border-Gavaskar Trophy has grown to be one of the most highly anticipated Test series for cricket fans worldwide since its inception in 1996.,"After a season full of limited-over series, the men in blue are all set to lock horns with world’s best Test team Australia for a rousing Test series beginning from Thursday, 9th February in Nagpur.
The Border-Gavaskar Trophy has grown to be one of the most highly anticipated Test series for cricket fans worldwide since its inception in 1996.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-4-interesting-test-records-of-india-versus-australia-rivalry-8427177/,sports
Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Team India could field four spinners as a plan to prepare rank turners for the 4-match Test series takes shape,"The pitch at the Jamtha Stadium in Nagpur looks green three days before 1st Test but going by the trend since 2015, on match day. it will look brown; Ashwin, Axar, Jadeja and Kuldeep could form India's spin quartet.","Three days before the first Test between India and Australia in Nagpur, the pitch for the game was dressed in green, splashed with odd brown wrinkles towards the centre. But the grass could be shaved off in the coming days, as India, it is learned, would dish out turners for the four-Test series and could potentially pack their playing eleven with four spinners to torment Australia’s batsmen.
A high-profile series at stake, the most intense rivalry in Test this century, and a spot in the World Test Championship final on the line, for which India ought to win at least three matches in this series, they have resorted to their well-worn ally, the turners. “We want to maximise our advantage and prepare turners. Spinners are our biggest strength and we should give them the best conditions to bowl and get wickets,” says a source in the team.
It has been the theme in the last few years, starting with South Africa’s tour to India in 2015 to the most recent one against Sri Lanka—unfold spinning tracks and skittle out the opponents. Remarkably, India have lost just two games in this eight-year span and won as many as 27 of the 34 games, without losing a series.

Often Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have sufficed—between them, they have snaffled a combined 484 wickets at 21.16 at home. But as though they are not enough, India would likely sharpen their spin cutting-edge with Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav. Australia would remember Yadav with a fright, as the left-arm wrist spinner had confounded them with his variations in Dharamshala in the series-decider in the 2017 series.
Patel, filling in for Jadeja whenever he was injured, has made himself undroppable, nabbing 47 wickets at an unearthly average of 14.29 in eight games. “Of course, the team will make the final call on the eleven on the eve of the match, or in the morning after having final look at the wicket, but four spinners are certainly in our plans, as we have four quality spinners in the team,” the source explained.
No one in the team management has openly spoken about instructing home associations or curators for spinning surfaces, but India’s pre-series camp as well as during the practice session at the Jamtha Stadium, Nagpur, threw ample signs of what is in store.
As many as 10 spinners were summoned to the camp as well in the nets, relentlessly bowling at the batsmen. Though pacers Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami—only one could likely feature should India pack four spinners—did bowl under the scorching forenoon sun, neither got an extended spell. At one point during the nets, Rohit Sharma, begged the batting coach to let him face a spinner, after continuously facing Siraj.
There were tell-tale signs that they were preparing and rehearsing to neutralise a wickedly turning track and the threat Australia’s spinners could pose. The battle-hardened Nathan Lyon apart, there are a bunch of callow spinners with a collective experience of nine Tests. On a turner, even obscure spinners could wreak havoc, especially as India’s current crop of batsmen have struggled to blossom on spinner-friendly surfaces.

So almost all of them were rigorously practising against spinners, unfurling sweeps and even the reverse sweep. Even Virat Kohli and Sharma, who seldom resort to reverse strokes, repeatedly attempted the shots. Sharma employed the slog-sweep, another potent weapon to counter spin, on several occasions.
And the practice continues….#INDvAUS https://t.co/qwRUSxcLBY pic.twitter.com/5mECrOjWiG
— BCCI (@BCCI) February 3, 2023
Kohli would instruct the bowlers to bowl short-of-length, and he would look to cut them on the back-foot. He would also shimmy down the track, meet the ball on the full and power them down the ground. The proficiency to sweep spinners brightens the prospect of Suryakumar Yadav’s Test debut.
The fielding drills too telegraphed the probable nature of the surface. For close to one hour, KL Rahul and Cheteshwar Pujara practised slip-catching to spinners alone, lunging sideways to pouch flying edges from the bat and bending low to pocket low catches. The close-in fielders too, spent hours polishing their reflexes. Batting coach Vikram Rathour would make spinners pound the rough and intentionally edge the ball to wicket-keeper KS Bharat, so that he gets a hang of the strips he could encounter in the series.
Their rivals Australia, who arrived in the city in the evening, too know the spin examination that awaits them and had trained accordingly, from preparing a scuffed-up track in North Sydney Oval before they boarded the flight to Bangalore and refusing the tour game so that they get time to bat on the wickets they want and not what they are provided, to roping in a raft of local spinners including a Ravi Ashwin impersonator to bowl at the nets.
Once they hit the nets, they would notice the dryness of the surfaces here and the copious amount of dust that explodes off the surfaces. If they bother digging up numbers, they would learn that India have won five of the six games here, three by an innings margin and only twice has the venue seen the fifth day. So the grass that might greet them would all be a facade before the odd brown wrinkles would spread and shade out the shades of green.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-team-india-could-field-four-spinners-as-a-plan-to-prepare-rank-turners-8427574/,sports
Chanderpaul 207 and Brathwaite 182 underpin Windies’ 447-6,"Rain meant just 89 overs were possible on the first two days of the match after West Indies had opted to bat, but the visitors accelerated the scoring on day three.","Tagenarine Chanderpaul hit a double hundred before West Indies declared on 447-6 and reduced Zimbabwe to 114-3 on day three Monday of the first test.
Chanderpaul was 207 not out when the declaration was made 10 overs before tea. The son of West Indies great Shivnarine Chanderpaul reached his maiden test hundred on a rain-affected second day, alongside fellow opener and captain Kraigg Brathwaite.
They resumed with the total at 221 without loss, and continued to dominate on the flat pitch by advancing to 336, the highest opening stand by West Indies in a test. They eclipsed the 298 between Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes in 1990 against England at St. John’s.

Brathwaite was attacking the bowling to give them enough time to bowl out Zimbabwe twice, when he moved forward to sweep Wellington Masakadza and was out lbw for 182 from 312 balls. He hit 18 boundaries and missed out on a second double century.
Kyle Mayers was bowled for 20 in the only other wicket before lunch, but legspinner Brandon Mavuta also got the next four wickets to earn his maiden five-for in only his third test, and first since 2018.
“It’s about patience and persistence, and today it paid off,” Mavuta said after finishing with 5-140 from 41 overs. “I’m quite happy to be back in the team, and to be in the position we are. I’m pretty chuffed to contribute.”
Chanderpaul, who started the day on 101, stood form against Mavuta and reached 200 in style by stepping into Masakadza and smashing him back over his head for his third six.
Chanderpaul added two more runs in the over and West Indies declared with him on 207 off 465 balls.

“Congrats to Tage on his maiden century, good to see him convert it to a double,” former captain Jason Holder said. “Well played to the captain as well. It was a really good partnership. Good to see them not only lay down the foundation but also take it really deep.
“I don’t want to talk about the team plan, we just need wickets. We need to be ruthless.”
In reply, Innocent Kaia and Tanunurwa Makoni, playing their first test, opened for a combined 63 past tea when Makoni was dismissed by Alzarri Joseph for 33.

Vinícius Júnior again targeted by racist insults in Spain,The Spanish league said Monday it will investigate the latest attacks after television images showed someone calling him a monkey during Real Madrid’s 1-0 loss at Mallorca on Sunday.,"The hate attacks against Vinícius Júnior continued in Spain over the weekend, with the Brazil forward again being targeted by racist insults in a league match.
The Spanish league said Monday it will investigate the latest attacks after television images showed someone calling him a monkey during Real Madrid’s 1-0 loss at Mallorca on Sunday.
Vinícius was also insulted after the match when he stopped to pose for photos and sign autographs for fans.
Vinícius, who is Black, has been subjected to insults since he came to play in Spain five years ago, and last month the attacks reached a new level when his effigy was hanged off a bridge in Madrid ahead of the derby against Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey.
He had also been targeted by fans in other stadiums before, including at Barcelona’s Camp Nou. The hate attacks also occurred in games at Valladolid and Athletic Bilbao.
The league has been reporting the insults to the Spanish soccer federation and to local authorities, and said it would do the same this time after “intolerable racist insults against Vinícius were again observed.”
The league said it was “working with RCD Mallorca to identify those responsible in order to take all necessary legal measures.” To speed up the process, the league said it created an email (StopRacismo@laliga.es) so fans who may have images or knowledge of those responsible can make contact and help it file the appropriate complaints.

Authorities were yet to find those responsible for hanging Vinícius’ effigy before the game against Atletico, and so far teams have not been punished for the racist insults against the Brazilian inside their stadiums.
An anti-violence committee said it was studying punishment to the Valladolid fans who insulted Vinícius in a match in December, which could include fines of 4,000 euros ($4,300) to each individual identified, as well as banning them from sports venues for one year.
Last year a large group of Atletico fans chanted “Vinícius, you are a monkey” outside Metropolitano Stadium, but Spanish state prosecutors closed a probe into the case citing a lack of evidence and downplayed its seriousness because the chants allegedly came within the rivalry setting of a soccer match.
The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.

Vinícius has been outspoken about the attacks against him but has yet to comment on the events from Sunday.
Real Madrid has also complained about how Vinícius, a speedy attacker known for his nifty dribbles, has been targeted by opposing players on the field. Valencia defender Gabriel Paulista was sent off in a game last week after a vicious foul on the Brazilian. Vinicius was also roughed up several times against Mallorca.
The 22-year-old Vinícius was also recently engulfed in controversy for his dancing in goal celebrations.

‘Want the ball to turn from Day 1’: Ravi Shastri wants turning tracks in Border-Gavaskar Trophy,"Ian Chappell said whenever he had asked curators what kind of pitch they thought was a good one, they said that one which saw a team winning on the fifth day after tea.","With the Border-Gavaskar Trophy just days away from starting, there has been a lot of focus on the pitches that will be prepared for the four Tests. Former Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy even went on to say that Australia will have an advantage if pitches for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy are not “unfair” ones — ones that are rank turners from the start. However, former Australian cricketer Ian Chappell has shot down his compatriot’s comments.
“What Ian Healy said that Australia will have the advantage… a lot of that is based on what Australia has done at home. They’re not playing at home. They’re playing in India. Why anyone would think that India don’t start with an advantage, I don’t know,” he said in a virtual press conference facilitated by Star Sports. “There’s a lot of crap spoken about pitches. I believe no one other than the curator should have a say on what wickets are produced. I don’t think it should be up to the players, the manager, the coach, anybody! You just produce a good pitch. Surely a curator has been a player and wants to produce a good pitch.”
He added whenever he had asked curators what kind of pitch they thought was a good one, they said that one which saw a team winning on the fifth day after tea. “That should be the aim of all curators,” he added.
Former India coach Ravi Shastri, meanwhile, said he wants to see the ball turning from the first day. “I want the ball to turn from Day 1! If you lose the toss, so be it. You want to see the ball turning a bit. Or something there for the bowlers on offer from Day 1. It’s your strength. You’re playing at home. Capitalise on it,” he said.
Advantage India
Despite the fact that Australia have not won a Test series in India since 2004, some former players Down Under have backed the world’s top-ranked test team to return victorious from India.
However, Chappell firmly believes the India will have the advantage. “Those comments coming from Australia are based on how they have performed at home. Playing well in Australia is a hell of a lot different than playing well in India. They have some players who are talented enough to do well in India. But the thing is you can go to India with a lot of confidence, but if they suddenly get you out cheaply, how long can you maintain that confidence in India. That’s crucial. Anyone giving Australia the advantage is talking through their hat! India have got to start as the favourites. But that shouldn’t bother the Australians. They should be going to India thinking they can win the series,” he said.
Shastri, meanwhile, lauded the Indian team for the resolve they have shown over the last few series against Australia.

“Just what Australia does to sides who tour there, India does to sides who tour here. Australia will really have to be on top of their game to really threaten India,” he said before adding that India should back themselves to win the series by a two-game margin.
Asked whether India versus Australia was the greatest rivalry in modern-day sport, Shastri replied: “No question. It’s not just the cricket on the field. The buzz that an India-Australia series creates is second to none in world cricket. India is one of the teams that has really competed against Australia. That’s what has got everybody to watch the series. More than anything else, credit must be given to the Indian players for making that happen. Australia always had a reputation: of playing in a certain fashion and dismantling sides. For India to step up and play them at their own game speaks volumes for the way the Indian players have performed over the last few years.”
Shastri was also asked what had changed for the Indians to make the step up. “We went to Australia to beat them. That’s what changed. You went there with no excuses whatsoever when it came to the conditions, the pitches we played on. Very early in that series I had said we’re going to take the pitch out of the equation. This thing about playing at home and playing overseas… to hell with that. You’re playing cricket on a 22-yard strip which is the same for both sides. Our endeavor was to take 20 wickets before they could take 20 wickets. And we did that.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/want-the-ball-to-turn-from-day-1-ravi-shastri-wants-turning-tracks-in-border-gavaskar-trophy-8427338/,sports

Bayern unhappy with injured Manuel Neuer for club criticism,The dispute centers on Bayern's decision to fire goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalovic on Jan. 23 due to what Salihamidžic said were “differences over the ways and means of working together”.,"Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn, sporting director Hasan Salihamidžic and team coach Julian Nagelsmann have all criticized injured captain Manuel Neuer for publicly expressing his disappointment with the club.
The dispute centers on Bayern’s decision to fire goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalovic on Jan. 23 due to what Salihamidžic said were “differences over the ways and means of working together”.
The firing was described by Neuer as “the worst thing I’ve experienced in my career” during an interview that appeared in the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and The Athletic website Friday.
Kahn told news agency DPA that Neuer’s comments do “neither justice to him as captain nor the values of Bayern” and he criticized the goalkeeper for their timing “ahead of very important games.” Salihamidžic accused Neuer of “putting his personal interests above those of the club”, while Nagelsmann on Sunday referred to Kahn’s statement and added his own criticism of Neuer.
“From Manuel’s perspective, I wouldn’t have given the interview, especially when he says in the same interview that the club is the priority. It doesn’t help calm things down,” said Nagelsmann.
Tapalovic, who joined Bayern with Neuer from Schalke in 2011, did not get on with Nagelsmann, who must now contend with an openly unhappy goalkeeper – and possibly more.
Kicker magazine reported Sunday that several team colleagues had expressed their solidarity with Neuer.

“We see him every day in rehab, we say hello every day,” Thomas Müller said after Bayern’s 4-2 win in Wolfsburg on Sunday. “We have personalities in the club, the biggest club in Germany, national team players and legends like Manu. And of course a couple of things happened, everyone has their own point of view. But we don’t let the football business influence us as players.” Tapalovic’s dismissal came just over a month after Neuer broke his leg in a skiing accident and was taken as a personal blow by the 37-year-old goalkeeper. Neuer is out for the rest of the season.
“For me it was a blow as I was already on the ground,” Neuer told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and The Athletic. “I felt my heart was being torn out.” Neuer, who faced a hostile reaction from Bayern fans when he joined the club from Schalke, said Tapalovic’s dismissal was even more damaging for him personally.
“Everyone in our goalkeeper group was torn apart. People burst into tears,” Neuer said in his first public comments on the matter since the coach was fired. “Toni was loved by the whole team.” Bayern has signed Yann Sommer as the injured Neuer’s replacement from Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Neuer, who praised the signing of Sommer, said he still doesn’t know why Tapalovic was fired.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There was no justification from what I could understand. Things were said that I don’t agree with. But I haven’t heard any arguments that rule out talking to each other and clearing things up,” said Neuer, who added that the issue led to him considering his future at the club.
Kahn referred to his own time as Germany goalkeeper, when he lost his place to Jens Lehmann after goalkeeping coach Sepp Maier left the German soccer federation.

“I was also disappointed at the time and I was furious with the federation,” said Kahn. “But the common aims were top priority for me. They were more important than my personal feelings. That’s why I decided at the time not to express myself publicly. Manuel has now done the opposite.” Kahn said the club will talk to Neuer about the matter “very clearly.” Nagelsmann said he hadn’t talked to the goalkeeper since his interview but “I am a person in need of harmony and my door is not closed, even if I would have chosen a different path.” Bayern drew its first three Bundesliga games of the year and has seen its lead whittled down to a point.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/bayern-unhappy-with-injured-manuel-neuer-for-club-criticism-8427269/,sports
Premier League accuses Manchester City of financial breaches,City are alleged to have breached rules relating to the provision of accurate financial information.,"The Premier League has referred Manchester City to an independent commission over more than 100 alleged breaches of finance rules since the club were acquired by the Abu Dhabi-based City Football Group.
League rules state that charges such as those faced by City could, if proved, result in a club being expelled from the Premier League in the worst-case scenario.
Offending clubs may alternately be deducted points, fined, or reprimanded.
City’s alleged breaches stretch from the 2009-10 season to the 2017-18 campaign, the league said on Monday.
The club, who were acquired by City Football Group in 2008, are also charged with failing to cooperate with and assist the Premier League in its investigation, which was launched in December 2018.
City are alleged to have breached rules relating to the provision of accurate financial information, “in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs,” the league said.
The club, who have won the Premier League title six times since the Abu Dhabi takeover, said they were surprised by the league’s “issuing of these alleged breaches”.

“The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position,” City added.
The charges stem from a Premier League investigation into City’s financial dealings launched four years ago, after the release of a tranche of “Football Leaks” documents obtained by the German publication Der Spiegel and reviewed by Reuters.
SUBSEQUENT BAN
City were subsequently banned from the Champions League by European governing body UEFA for two years, but successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which overturned the ban in 2020.
The club were fined 30 million euros ($32.28 million) by UEFA, which CAS reduced to 10 million euros.

In addition to the charges relating to the club’s revenue and operating costs, City are also alleged to have not fully disclosed managerial remuneration from the 2009-10 to 2012-13 seasons, when Roberto Mancini was manager.
The club are also charged with failing to comply with Premier League’s rules requiring clubs to follow UEFA’s financial fair play (FFP) regulations from the 2013-14 to 2017-18 seasons and failing to follow the Premier League’s rules on profit and sustainability from the 2015-16 to 2017-18 seasons.
FFP regulations are designed to stop clubs running up big losses through spending on players. They also ensure sponsorship deals are based on their real market value and are genuine commercial agreements — and not ways for owners to pump cash into a club to get around the rules.
“The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel,” the Premier League said in a statement.

"Eventually leagues with cricketing ecosystem will survive, rest will fade away: Ganguly","With the T20 leagues mushrooming around the world, players have started to prioritise franchise cricket over national duty.","Players getting lured by the growing number of T20 leagues is a short-term phenomenon as eventually “only a few” financially sustainable leagues will survive, said former India captain Sourav Ganguly on Monday.
With the T20 leagues mushrooming around the world, players have started to prioritise franchise cricket over national duty.
The Big Bash League, which is an established product, just got over while inaugural leagues are being staged in UAE and South Africa at the moment.
A league is also planned in the United States later this year.
However, Ganguly said in the long term only leagues with an ecosystem will survive.
“We keep talking about the leagues around the world, if you look at the IPL it is in a different ecosystem and different league, the Big Bash in Australia does very well, The Hundred does very well in the UK and I see the South Africa league doing very well, I have been watching it for last three weeks,” he said at a Sportstar event here.
“The common thing among all these leagues is that they are in countries where cricket is popular. So I believe over a period of time, four five years, it is going to get to stage very few will exist and I know which ones will exist.

“Certain (leagues) will remain and certain will move away because players will realise it is not that important. Right now they are new and everyone wants to be part of it so you see the rush.
“But ultimately it will get back to a stage where country will be as important as the league because only a few will survive because of the ecosystem.” Zimbabwe used to be a force to reckon with in world cricket in the 90s but cricket has declined in the country amid administrative issues.
“It has got to do a lot with administration (teams struggling in international cricket). I keep saying that, I have been president of CAB for five years and then BCCI president for three years and represented India in the ICC, I have seen the entire structure and support system that makes the game possible,” he said.
“I remember I played my first world cup in 1999, Zimbabwe could beat anybody. I am sure Zimbabwe cricket did not have a lot of money then, even India did not have that much money.

“The West Indies, days of Michael Holding, Andy Roberts and Joel Garner, where was the money? There wasn’t. Administration is very important to hold on to the players.

‘I think people saw the best of the BBL this season’: League’s GM feels condensed season reason behind rising numbers,"A major takeaway from the analytics comes from the fact that the final games didn't feature the likes of Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, who joined the Australia Test squad in India.","An average of 15,892 attended the non-finals Big Bash League 12 games, while that number soared to over 25,000 for the five finals.
The 2022/23 season saw a rising interest in the league and may as well have been its best ever version per Alistair Dobson, Cricket Australia’s GM of the BBL.
“We feel like a shorter season is going to be even better again. I think people saw the best of the BBL this season, being able to bring it back by a week or so – the end of season – will allow the overseas players to stay a bit longer, and will hopefully enable the best players to take part and I think in this situation we’d love fans to be really desperate to see as much BBL as they can,” Dobson told  SEN 1170.
Dobson further added, “I think crowds are always going to be your key health metric, I think the strength of the broadcast comes off the energy for the crowd. We have some metrics we put around that and this season was the equal most number of close matches ever in the BBL.”
The greatest final ever?

“They’re all the indicators, but ultimately from our perspective crowds are the key and we were delighted with the way our clubs were able to connect with our fans and bring people into the grounds.”
A major takeaway from the analytics comes from the fact that the final games didn’t feature the likes of Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, who joined the Australia Test squad in India.
Dobson added that with the presence of the international Australia stars, the tournament would be an even bigger success. “Getting the best players out there is always part of the mix of the BBL season and if we can find a way for the biggest name Australian players to get out there we always will”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-think-people-saw-the-best-of-the-bbl-this-season-leagues-gm-feels-condensed-season-reason-behind-rising-numbers-8426944/,sports

Sridhar in his book wrote, “We were training at the Adelaide Oval in January 2016, the day before the start of the three-match T20I series against Australia. I was putting Virat through the grind and, typically, he held nothing back. Yuvraj walked past me when I had expected him to join in and sat himself down in the dugout, watching us intently.”
“Once Virat had left the field a few minutes later, Yuvi came across for his practice. He told me, ‘I couldn’t have kept pace with Virat or matched his intensity. I thought it best that I leave you guys to it and once he finished, I can work on my fielding at my own pace,” he added.

Sports pitch for level playing field in cricket-mad Pakistan,"There is only one sport that matters in Pakistan and that's cricket, a massive money-making machine. But minors sports like rugby are struggling to get off the ground due to lack of investment and interest, stunting their growth at home and chances of success overseas. Even previously popular sports like squash and field hockey, which Pakistan dominated for decades, can't find their form.","On Islamabad’s outskirts, burly men bind together in a scrum on a rugby pitch that has seen better days. The sign bearing the club’s name is worn. The floodlights are too costly to use, given high electricity prices and the paltry $135 total that the club earns in membership fees every month.
Watching the players, coach Mohammed Zahir Uddin said ruefully: “There’s only one game in Pakistan.”
That would be cricket, the country’s most popular sport, a juggernaut when it comes to sponsorship, broadcasting rights and capturing the public’s imagination.
Cricket has totally eclipsed other sports, even ones Pakistan excelled at. Field hockey, Pakistan’s national sport, once propelled the country to Olympic gold and global glory, but it has waned in popularity and participation. Pakistan dominated the squash world for decades, only to become a shadow of its former self.

Prospects are even bleaker for a sport like rugby, which has no heyday or heroes in Pakistan.
“There’s no support from the bodies that there ought to be in terms of funding, spreading the word,” said Hammad Safdar, who captains Pakistan’s national rugby team. “The majority of sports have the same issue. That’s why, in terms of performance, in the later stages when there’s a test, we lack because there’s no foundation.”
Pakistan hosts the South Asian Games next year, the biggest sporting tournament to be held in the country for 20 years. It won 143 medals the last time it hosted, including 38 gold. But years of neglect of sports could affect its medal tally this time.

Advocates of sports under cricket’s shadow say they don’t have the environment to thrive or take top prizes, with a lack of investment and interest. Even universally loved soccer has its struggles in Pakistan. Infighting and government interference have led to suspensions from the global body FIFA, stunting its growth at home and chances overseas.

Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, has a national government sports budget of around $15.3 million, far smaller than others in the region. The Pakistan Sports Board, which oversees all sports in the country and their federations, did not respond to interview requests.
Rugby gets no government money but a grant from the global rugby body. If it needs more, it asks the chairman or president of the Pakistan Rugby Union to give from their own pockets.
The national rugby pitch in the eastern city of Lahore is on army land. It lacks changing rooms. It has no seating, so organizers rent chairs for tournaments. Rugby development coach Shakeel Malik concedes it’s hard to attract funding without results, but that it’s hard to get results without funding.

Cricket, which gets no government funding, has a budget of around $66 million. It shot into the stratosphere with a 1992 World Cup win by a national team captained by Imran Khan, who later went on to enter politics and served as prime minister from 2018-2022.
Pakistan has never dominated cricket the way it once did in in squash and hockey; it has only two world championships to its name, and the national team is notoriously unpredictable. But it’s a big business with infrastructure to nurture talent, a thirst for empire building, rampant commercialism, and a steady supply of domestic and international matches for TV. It’s so embedded in Pakistani life that the prime minister approves the appointment of the cricket board chairman.

Its rise in the 1990s coincided with the beginning of the end for hockey and squash.
Pakistan was the superpower of squash for decades, winning the British Open 17 years in a row by 1963. Specifically, one family, the Khans, ruled the sport. The last of the dynasty — Jahangir Khan, a former World No. 1 racket-wielding machine — was unbeaten for hundreds of matches. He won the British Open 10 years in a row until his final victory in 1991.

Khan told The Associated Press that even he doesn’t understand how the family amassed as many trophies as they did, without facilities and investment. “Even today, Pakistan’s name comes first in squash, and so does this family’s name,” he said, speaking at the squash complex named after him in Karachi.
He’s pained by its decline. Pakistan is now 65th in the world men’s squash rankings. Khan said the sport failed to build on his family’s legacy.
He argues that mismanagement had undermined the sport and that players need to show more achievement to attract sponsorship. “If people have set a bar, it’s up to you to make the most of it and build on it. Funding is not a solution. You produced a world champion when you had nothing.”
And there is also cricket’s stranglehold. “It’s not necessary to have all the talent playing one thing,” he said.

In the heyday of field hockey, people turned out in the tens of thousands to watch matches, said Samiullah Khan, a player who helped win Pakistan a stack of medals in the sport at the Olympics, World Cup and Asian Games until the 1990s.

“It hurts my heart” to see the current state of hockey, he said. He said Pakistan’s teams didn’t adjust to changes like the synthetic turf and rule-changes in Europe that, in his view, turned the sport into “a free-for-all.”
“Hockey became like any other sport, like rugby. The power left, the skill left,” he said.
But there is hope, and a love that lingers for hockey. In a Karachi suburb, about a dozen young women pad up for practice on a team with the Karachi Hockey Association.

Kashmala Batool, 30, has been playing hockey for almost half her life. “It’s our national game,” she said. “Despite it not getting support or government funding, the enjoyment we get playing our national game can’t be found in any other.”
Shazma Naseem, the goalkeeper, started out in college and has been playing at the national level for five years. She sees the enthusiasm her parents still have for the sport and feels a duty to keep it going.

"PSG ‘having conversations with Messi about contract extension’, Barcelona comeback may not happen","In the absence of Neymar and Mbappe, Messi had lighted up the field in PSG's 3-1 win over Montpellier last week.","“Calm down.” Those were the two words Lionel Messi uttered to the Paris Saint Germain sports advisor Luis Campos at halftime against Montpellier. With no Mbappe or Neymar in the squad, the Parisians relied on their World Cup winning forward to guide them to a win in Ligue 1.
“I remember what I said to Messi at halftime against Montpellier: ‘You have to lead everyone else’. He replied: ‘Calm down’. And he had an exceptional second half,” Campos told Mundo Deportivo.
Messi scored in a 3-1 win for the visitors to further solidify their case for the domestic title after a couple of hiccups since the league’s resumption post World Cup that included a 3-1 defeat to Racing Club de Lens. In light of his recent performance, the questions on his future at the club have been asked. Messi joined PSG in the summer of 2021 on a two-year deal and with his contract set to expire, Campos has now revealed that the club is working on an extension.
“Right now, we’re having conversations with Messi about his contract extension. I’d like to keep him in the project, I’m not going to hide it. We’re talking right now to achieve this goal and continue having him with us,” the PSG sports advisor confessed.
Messi joined PSG from Barcelona after the latter failed to offer him a contract owing to financial crisis from extravagant expenditure on transfer markets and player wages over the past few seasons leading to enormous debts.
The Argentina captain is the reason why PSG are still confident of the upcoming few games despite French star Kylian Mbappe being ruled out of action due to injury.

“Losing Kylian is of course very hard. I saw him very sad after the injury, but I also saw him working to speed up his recovery as soon as possible. That is the personality of the winners,” Campos said.

On the third player who completes the French club’s ultimate forward trio, the PSG sports advisor added, “Since my arrival at PSG I have not had any criticism to make of Neymar. He is always punctual and has a good disposition. This Neymar is an incredible Neymar”
However, Campos is well aware that for PSG to achieve their first ever Champions League title aside from domestic success, it’ll take more than their front three.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: ‘R Ashwin is a gun’- Usman Khawaja says spin with new ball will be a challenge in India,"""R Ashwin is a gun. He’s very skilful, he’s got a lot of tricky little variations, he uses the crease quite well too,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald.","Much has been said about Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne in the middle but Usman Khawaja’s form at the top could well determine if Australia are to pile up big first-innings total to threaten India. Khawaja vs R Ashwin could set the tone for the games and he knows it.
Ashwin is a gun. He’s very skilful, he’s got a lot of tricky little variations, he uses the crease quite well too,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald. “If you asked me the same question when I was younger, I probably wouldn’t have been able to answer a lot of things because I didn’t really learn about how to face what off-spinners are doing.”
“But it’s one of those really good challenges. The wicket’s going to turn here at some point, whether day one, day three or day four, and he’s going to be in the game and bowl a lot of overs. So it’s all about figuring out how I’m going to play against him, how I’m going to score runs against him, what he might do. If you bat a long time against him, he’s going to change his game plans against you.”
Ashwin had Smith and Labuschagne in trouble in the last series in Australia by luring them to the leg-trap.
“He’s not the kind of guy who’ll do the same thing over and over, he’s going to try to work you out. So I’m looking forward to it. Four Test matches is a long time, so hopefully I can do alright and score runs for my team, but you know what, it’s always fun. Subcontinent, playing against spin is some of the most fun you’ll have in terms of finding a way to get in and score runs, it’s quite rewarding,” Khawaja said.

Khawaja also raised the point about how the Indian spinners would be more difficult to face when the ball was new.
“When we train, the new ball on spinning wickets is always the hardest time. People assume opening the batting is the best time to bat in the subcontinent, it is when it’s flat, but it’s not when it’s spinning when there’s so much variation with that new ball. Once it softens up it gets easier to predict what it’s going to do. There’s no guarantees in this game, but at least there’s a bit more maturity particularly in the batting, and more maturity in the bowling. We’ve learnt a lot over the last 10 years, particularly the types of wickets we can get and how we think we can perform and go out and win Test matches out here. It feels like we’re in a better spot than before, but it’s always going to be tough.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-r-ashwin-is-a-gun-usman-khawaja-says-spin-with-new-ball-will-be-a-challenge-in-india-8426350/,sports
"Border-Gavaskar Trophy: ‘Can’t be conservative in India. Boland to play if two seamers, Morris if three,’ says Ian Healy",The absence of Josh Hazlewood and Cameroon Green for first Test has upset Australia’s team balance. Will they play two spinners or three seamers?,"The former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy reckons it has to be Scott Boland if Australia go with just two seamers and that the fastest bowler in the pack Lance Morris can feature if they go with three seamers.
That assessment also raises the question about Australia’s bowling composition. Will they go with two spinners and two seamers? The injury to their allrounder Cameroon Green, who however is still hopeful of making a surprise recovery, has put the team’s combinations in disarray. If Green was available with his fast-medium, then Australia could easily go with two spinners. Green is still likely to miss and it has left a hole in the attack.
“First Test, we’ve just got Cummins,” Healy said on SENQ Breakfast radio. “We might play two spinners or may not, which would mean we’d need Boland and Morris.

“I don’t think we win in India by being conservative, but I think just Cummins and Morris in together only is maybe not enough. We’ve only won one Test (in India) since 2004,” Healy said.
The other day Hazlewood seemed to hint at Boland as likely replacement for him as he brought up the fact that Boland is used to bowling on flat tracks at Melbourne Cricket Ground.
“Scotty has bowled plenty at the MCG when it was a flat wicket, it probably wasn’t swinging or reverse swinging so he knows how to work hard for a long period of time,” Hazlewood said of Boland with a Test bowling average of 12.21.

"Harry Kane’s milestone goal gives Tottenham win against Manchester City, helps Arsenal too","The England captain's milestone strike earned Tottenham a 1-0 win Sunday over Manchester City, which was looking for a victory to trim the gap to Premier League leader Arsenal to two points.","Harry Kane broke Tottenham’s all-time scoring record with a goal — his 267th for the club — that will have been celebrated almost as jubilantly by the other team in north London.
The England captain’s milestone strike earned Tottenham a 1-0 win Sunday over Manchester City, which was looking for a victory to trim the gap to Premier League leader Arsenal to two points.
In the end, Arsenal wasn’t punished for losing 1-0 at Everton on Saturday — and maybe that’s no surprise. After all, City now hasn’t won, or even scored, in five games at Tottenham’s new stadium in either the Premier League or the Champions League.

Even the absence of Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, recovering in his native Italy after having his gallbladder removed this week, couldn’t change the narrative around this particular fixture.
Kane swept home the winner in the 15th minute after Pierre-Emile Højbjerg intercepted a pass out from the back by City midfielder Rodri and set up the striker to score his 200th Premier League goal. Only two other players — Alan Shearer (260) and Wayne Rooney (208) — have reached that figure.
Kane broke the tie for all-time Tottenham goals he had with the late Jimmy Greaves, who played for the club from 1961-70.
City was the architect of its own downfall for the goal, just as it was when conceding two sloppy first-half goals against Tottenham last month before rallying for a 4-2 win at Etihad Stadium.

This time, there was no comeback despite a second-half resurgence sparked by the introduction of Kevin De Bruyne, who was benched for the second straight game against Tottenham, and the 87th-minute sending-off of Cristian Romero for a second yellow card.
City lost for the fourth time this season in the league and stayed five points behind Arsenal, which has a game in hand as it bids for a first top-flight title since 2004.

“Outstanding and composed,” Forest manager Steve Cooper said of the three-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, who moved from Paris Saint-Germain this week. “The obvious talking points are the saves, and rightly so, he deserves all the credit for that, but I loved his composure and game management and decision-making.”

How Indo-Pak cricket thrived in Musharraf’s rule,"Musharraf, who passed away in a Dubai hospital on Sunday, used cricket as a strong diplomatic tool to improve relations between the two countries when he led Pakistan first as Chief Executive and then President.","Pakistan’s former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, the architect of the Kargil War in 1999, loved his cricket.
Musharraf, who passed away in a Dubai hospital on Sunday, used cricket as a strong diplomatic tool to improve relations between the two countries when he led Pakistan first as Chief Executive and then President.
An avid follower of the game, Musharraf wasted no time in bringing his blue eyed boy, Lt-General Tauqir Zia, as Chairman of the cricket board soon after his military coup in October 1999.
But in 2003 the moment he learnt that Tauqir’s son Junaid had played for Pakistan, Musharraf asked the PCB Chairman to resign as he saw the entire episode as a conflict of interest.
Musharraf then brought in former career diplomat and ex foreign secretary, Shaharyar Khan, who had served as ambassador in New Delhi, to head the cricket board.
And few months later, Shaharyar fulfilled Musharraf’s ambition of having the Indian team tour Pakistan.
Before Musharraf’s coup, Pakistan had been to India in early 1999 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Indian Prime Minister but after that they were no bilateral exchanges between the two countries until 2004.
The Indian team led by Sourav Ganguly came in March-April 2004 and it turned out to be a famous diplomatic success for the military ruler as the top names from India including government ministers and celebrities were invited to Pakistan to watch the matches with red carpet treatment laid out for them.
ADVERTISEMENT
The tour was a success with Musharraf wasting no opportunity to have photo shoots with the Indian team and his famous remarks about MS Dhoni’s hair style became a hit in both countries.
His meeting with the Indian team players were all exercises aimed at softening relations between the two countries and to portray himself as a moderate and liberal leader.
And the plan worked to a great extent as never in a tenure of a Pakistani premier or President did so many Indo-Pak bilateral series take place than in Musharraf’s tenure.
After the 2004 series, India came again to Pakistan in early 2006 while the Pakistan team also toured India for full Test series first in 2005 and then in 2007 returning to Pakistan in 2008 for the Asia Cup.
ADVERTISEMENT
Before Musharraf’s time, bilateral tours between the two countries had been far and few with huge gaps in between. Pakistan went to India in 1979-80 after a gap of nearly 18 years and India came to Pakistan in 1978/79 for the first time since 1954/55.
Ironically these tours in the late 70s also took place during the tenure of another military dictator, General Zia ul Haq, who also used cricket diplomacy to reduce tensions.
Musharraf himself wasted no opportunity to show up at cricket matches even in India when Pakistan was playing. In 2005, he turned up at the Feroze Shah Kotla ground to a warm welcome.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-indo-pak-cricket-thrived-in-musharrafs-rule-8425980/,sports

It was a close contest from the opening exchanges, with India creating more chances despite a deluge of midfield traffic.
Sumati Kumari had the chance to get the lead early on in the seventh minute, when she was played through by Nitu Linda, but Bangladesh keeper Rupna Chakma pulled off a great save. Chakma was again called into action around the quarter hour mark, when Sunita Munda flicked a Shubhangi Singh cross with her head. Shubhangi was accurate with her set-pieces, and thought she had helped India take the lead on the half-hour mark, when Kajol tapped her delivery in, but the referee had deemed the delivery to have gone out of play before curling in.

Bangladesh had a rare attempt when Shaheda let one fly from long range with minutes left for the half time whistle, but it landed on the roof of the net. India head coach Maymol Rocky played her hand at half time itself, bringing on Neha in place of Sumati Kumari. The midfield scrum thickened in the second half, but Kajol managed to get a shot on target from a long range free-kick, which was duly saved by Chakma.
The Bangladesh custodian was at it again a few minutes later when Neha surged into the box from the left flank and looked to fizz in a dangerous cross to Apurna Narzary, but Chakma plucked it out of the air. That was the last piece of action for Narzary, who was soon replaced by Lynda Kom Serto.
Neha had the golden opportunity of the second half, when Munda picked her out from the right, but the ball took an awkward bounce off the artificial turf and went out of play.
Anita Kumari, Tania Kanti, and Babina Lisham were soon introduced into the fray with the clock ticking down, but the two sides remained locked till the end.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/india-held-to-goalless-draw-by-bangladesh-in-saff-u-20-womens-cship-8425946/,sports

The hosts got on the board with an own-goal by Nacho Fernández, who was replacing Militão in defense. Nacho went for a high cross and deflected the ball into his own net over goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, who started in place of Courtois.

England, who joined Spurs from Chelsea in January, cancelled out Jess Carter’s eighth-minute opener for the Blues, but James crowned a mazy run from the right wing by drilling a calm finish to put them in front again.

However despite the cleared charges, United released a statement writing, “The club will now conduct its own process before determining next steps. We will not make any further comment until that process is complete.”
The 21-year-old, on the other hand, was not happy with the club’s support during the entire legal process and “at the time he was adamant he didn’t want to put on the red shirt again.” according to another report by the Sun.
“He felt like the club didn’t stand by him. He said he would be happy to go and play in China as long as that meant he was getting paid well and was playing. His view may have softened over the last few months, but he was not happy at all,” The Sun reported, quoting a source.

"Babar Azam, Shahid Afridi moved to safety after explosion near stadium in Quetta","An exhibition match of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) at the Nawab Akbar Bugti Stadium was halted for some time following an explosion in the Police Lines area, which left five people injured.","Top Pakistani cricketers, including captain Babar Azam and Shahid Afridi, among others, were taken to the safety of the dressing room after a terror attack a few miles down the road where they were playing on Sunday.
An exhibition match of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) at the Nawab Akbar Bugti Stadium was halted for some time following an explosion in the Police Lines area, which left five people injured.
A senior police officer said that rescue work had been completed at the site and the injured had been taken to hospital.
The outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on Sunday. It stated that the security officials were targeted in the blast.
The exhibition match between PSL sides Quetta Gladiators and Peshawar Zalmi was organised by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after pressure from Baloch fans that Quetta also get the status of a PSL venue.
“As soon as the explosion happened, as a precautionary measure, the match was stopped and players taken to the dressing room for a while. Later, after the green signal, the match resumed,” the police official said.
The ground was packed for the match.
Sports activity in Quetta, the capital of the restive Balochistan province, has come to a standstill for the last several years due to fragile security situation and the constant threat of terror attacks.

"Jhulan appointed team mentor of Mumbai Indians women’s team, Charlotte Edwards head coach","Former India all-rounder Devieka Palshikaar will be the batting coach, while Trupti Chandgadkar Bhattacharya will be the team manager.","Recently retired India legend Jhulan Goswami has been entrusted with the dual role of team mentor and bowling coach by Mumbai Indians for the upcoming Women’s Premier League (WPL) season.
Former England women’s team captain and the second-highest run-getter in women’s ODIs and Tests Charlotte Edwards has been appointed head coach of the franchise for the inaugural edition scheduled in March.
Former India all-rounder Devieka Palshikaar will be the batting coach, while Trupti Chandgadkar Bhattacharya will be the team manager.
Jhulan, a Padma Shri who retired last year after the series against England, has more than 350 international wickets in a career spanning more than two decades.
She is the highest wicket-taker in WODIs and also has the distinction of taking maximum wickets in history of Women’s ODI World Cup. Jhulan rose to No. 1 in the ICC Women’s ODI bowling rankings in January 2016 and post-retirement she is mentoring the Bengal women’s team.
Edwards too had a cricketing career spanning two decades and she led the England side to an ODI and T20I World Cup title triumph. Post-retirement, the 43-year-old has been coaching teams in England and Australia and is an ICC ‘Hall of Famer’.
Devieka, a former right-handed batter and leg-spinner, was the assistant coach of India between 2014 and 2016. She was also associated with the Bangladesh team as assistant coach, winning the 2018 Asian Cup with them.

India’s chances in T20 WC will be largely dependent on top-order: Mithali,The legendary batter added that the Indian bowlers will have to show a marked improvement in testing conditions at the marquee event beginning on Friday in South Africa.,"Former skipper Mithali Raj feels India’s chances of winning the Women’s T20 World Cup will depend largely on the top order’s form.
The legendary batter added that the Indian bowlers will have to show a marked improvement in testing conditions at the marquee event beginning on Friday in South Africa.
“India’s chances will be largely dependent on the top order. Smriti Mandhana is playing well and is a match winner,” Mithali wrote in her column for the ICC.
“Harmanpreet Kaur has looked in good form too but we have to beat Australia and England you need others batters to come to the party.” The Indian team, which takes on Pakistan in their tournament opener on February 12 in Cape Town, have been playing in South Africa.
The Indian team, which recently finished runners up in a Tri series against hosts South Africa and West Indies, will be fielding a relatively inexperienced pace unit barring veteran Shikha Pandey.
“The bowling will be tested and that is where we need to see an improvement,” Mithali added.
The 40-year-old hopes the U19 World Cup-winning duo of Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh make use of the knowledge that they have gained while playing the age group tournament on these conditions.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I hope Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh also have a good run at the World Cup considering they have gained so much experience of the conditions in South Africa.
“I am excited about some of the young players coming through and there is definitely some talent in the Under-19s team which I had the chance to see play at the inaugural ICC Under-19s Women’s T20 World Cup.”
Australia favourites to win
Mithali opined defending champions Australia’s excellent batting department make them favourites to win the event for an unprecedented sixth time.
“I think everyone would agree that Australia are the favourites, and deservedly so. I am expecting, tight, competitive matches.They are so difficult to beat because they bat deep and have an excellent batting line-up.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There are not many teams who can rival them in terms of big hitters, and the fact they have numerous players who can play a similar role means that if one fails, others can step in.
However, Mithali feels India have a knack of producing their best against Australia.
“We saw recently that when they toured India although that was a very competitive series but when it came down to it, more often than not, it was Australia who came out on top.
“While Australia are definitely favourites, we have seen India and England play some of their best cricket in the knockout stages of tournaments so I would not write them off.
ADVERTISEMENT
“India also have the knack of bringing their best against Australia.”
WPL
The inaugural Women’s Premier League (WPL) will be played this year with the auction slated to be held on February 13 in Mumbai.
Mithali, who made significant contributions in popularising the women’s game during her 23-year long glorious career, feels franchise cricket will not only help the players become financially secure but also enable them to invest in their game.
“What is great at this moment is that the women’s game is constantly evolving. Where 140 used to be a par score in a T20, now you can see 160-180 plus chased down, and so many matches go down to the wire.
ADVERTISEMENT
“That change has come down to the increase of leagues all over the world, with the WBBL in Australia, the Super League in England and of course the Women’s Premier League in India which is going to start this year.
“Those platforms not only give local players the chance to interact with overseas stars, but they also offer better financial stability which allows them to invest in their own games, hiring personal coaches or strength and conditioning coaches.
While Mithali, who retired last year, will not be playing in the league, she has been roped in as a mentor and advisor by Gujarat Giants.
“I am not surprised at all that we have got to this point, the Women’s Premier League in India is a huge development.
ADVERTISEMENT
“While I will not be playing, I will be fortunate enough to serve as a mentor and advisor for the Gujarat Giants.
“There is no disappointment about the fact that I missed out on playing in it, my journey as a cricketer was different and I was able to play my part in the evolution of the sport.
She hopes the league will help in player development.

"Haaland can improve by watching Kane, says Guardiola","City came from two goals down to beat Spurs 4-2 at the Etihad Stadium last month. They are second in the league standings with 45 points, five behind leaders Arsenal, while Spurs are fifth with 36 points.","Manchester City striker Erling Haaland can improve by watching and learning from his Tottenham Hotspur counterpart Harry Kane, manager Pep Guardiola said before the Premier League champions travel to the north London club on Sunday.
Norway’s Haaland, 22, scored his fourth league hat-trick in City’s 3-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend, taking his tally to 25 goals from 19 games as his sensational debut season in the English top-flight continues.
But Guardiola said Haaland can develop his all-round game by studying players like Kane, who became Tottenham’s joint all-time record goalscorer on Jan. 23.
“With Erling, one of the attributes that surprised me the most is how he is aware he can improve in many departments,” Guardiola said.
“And I’m pretty sure maybe watching Harry Kane, but not necessarily Harry, other players too, he has the will to think, ‘I can do better.’ With his age, this is the best thing he can believe. Otherwise, it would be boring.”
Kane, who has 16 league goals, scored the winner in Tottenham’s 1-0 win at Fulham on Monday to draw level with the late Jimmy Greaves on 266 goals for the club.
“Harry Kane remains one of the best strikers I have ever seen in my life,” Guardiola added. “What an exceptional player – the numbers and, more than the goals, the quality.

"Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Lyon, Australia cannot afford one bad session, says Karthik",Karthik also added that the onus was on Lyon to be perfect. Even one bad session by the spinner could take the game away from the Australians,"Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik believes that Australia’s ceiling in this series depends on the temperament of Nathan Lyon and that the Aussie off-spinner will be under tremendous pressure in this series to deliver a win.
Lyon will lead Australia’s spin bowling against an Indian team that has faced an increasing amount of questions on their ability to play spin bowling. Karthik, though, clarified that it was off-spin particularly that was turning out to be a problem for Indian batsmen.
“Our Achilles heel has not been spin bowling but off-spin bowling interestingly,” said Karthik to Cricbuzz.
He then added, “They have a world class off-spinner in Lyon. You also must understand that he will be under a lot of pressure knowing that he will be the key bowler for Australia to steer the ship in which direction it needs to go. One bad session from his part could mean the Test match is moving in a direction against Australia and that’s a lot of pressure to handle.”
Karthik also compared the spin bowling departments of both teams and said that while Ashwin had the likes of Jadeja and Axar Patel backing him, the Australians didn’t have the same depth and experience in their spin bowling ranks.
“We have to understand Ashton Agar hasn’t played too much Test cricket neither has Mitchell Swepson nor Todd Murphy so a lot has to depend on Lyon to go well. On the other hand, Ashwin has Jadeja and Axar to back him up,” said Karthik.
Karthik also added that the onus was on Lyon to be perfect. Even one bad session by the spinner could take the game away from the Australians. Karthik then cited the example of Shreyas Iyer in a reserve game taking Lyon on.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Shreyas Iyer literally smacked him in a side game in CCI. When the pressure is there, Lyon will need to stand up. A lot of his temperament and his testament will come to the fore. Even though India hasn’t been playing off-spin well, these matches are going to be in India and we have to trust our ability to play spin which has been part of our heritage and lineage over a period of time,” said Karthik.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-lyon-australia-cannot-afford-one-bad-session-says-karthik-8425036/,sports

"Border Gavaskar Trophy: Came close to buying adult diapers, says Matt Renshaw on Pune bathroom emergency","At a crucial juncture in a Test at Pune in 2017, Renshaw caused bewilderment and anger when he bolted back to the pavilion, retired hurt.","Matthew Renshaw could possibly be called in to take on the whites against India in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy series but has yet to fully recover from the horrors of what could have been in his previous stint in India, particularly in the Test match at Pune in 2017.
Batting on 15, Renshaw was on the crease with then captain Steve Smith. He was then captured on cameras making a bolt for the pavilion with Smith wearing an angry and confused expression. David Warner had just been dismissed, Australia were in a tricky spot and Renshaw was making a break for it. It was later revealed that a bathroom emergency had caused the Aussie batsmen to make an escape.
“I was in the chemist the other day and I walked past and saw some adult diapers and I was so close to buying them,” Renshaw said to the Australian.
“I’d just rather be safe than sorry! I’ll try and keep the diet under control so everything else can be sorted.”
Drama has followed Renshaw since, what with the covid drama that followed him in his comeback Test at Sydney recently. “I’d rather have Covid than go off to the toilet every day of the week,” Renshaw said.
He then added, “It was definitely different (being isolated from teammates at the SCG). As I said to a few of the boys, it’ll be another good chapter in my book. It was just so strange. I didn’t feel like I was terribly Covid sick, I just felt like I had a bit of hay fever. Then had to test, tested positive, then straight into another dressing room.”
Renshaw later admitted that the talk over his positive covid Test almost made the occasion special and that him pulling on the baggy green for the first time in five years was now a memorable moment for him.

Border Gavaskar Trophy: Green’s ‘surprise’ progress leaves McDonald hopeful ahead of first Test ,"With Green unlikely to be able to bowl in the first test, captain Pat Cummins looks like being paired with Josh Hazlewood in the attack with Mitchell Starc yet to arrive in India as he also recovers from a finger injury.","Australia coach Andrew McDonald remains hopeful Cameron Green can feature against India when the first test between the nations begins in Nagpur on Thursday after the all-rounder’s finger injury made “significant” improvement.
Green damaged his right index finger during the Boxing Day test win over South Africa in Melbourne and was only given clearance to return to training by his doctor on Monday following surgery.
The 23-year-old bowled with soft balls for 30 minutes in the nets at the Australian camp in Bangalore before doing an hour’s batting practice. McDonald said Green still had progress to make before he could be considered for the series opener.
“We’ve got a fair bit to work through him before the first test match,” McDonald told reporters. “We haven’t put a clear line through him or put him on the team-sheet yet.
“I wouldn’t say he was in discomfort when he was bowling. One of the deliveries jarred the bottom of the bat, and that can create discomfort for anyone.
“There’s a bit of awareness around that finger. He’s made some significant steps forward in the last couple of days, probably to my surprise.
“There’s still an outside chance that, everything going well, he might be on the team sheet.”

With Green unlikely to be able to bowl in the first test, captain Pat Cummins looks like being paired with Josh Hazlewood in the attack with Mitchell Starc yet to arrive in India as he also recovers from a finger injury. Cummins acknowledged the make-up of Australia’s bowling line-up remained unclear.
“I wouldn’t say (picking two spinners) is a given,” he said. “It’s very conditions dependent, particularly this first test, so once we get to Nagpur, we’ll see.
“I think sometimes, talking about a couple of spinners, you forget how good a lot of our fast bowlers have been in all conditions.
“We’ve got plenty of bowling options here – finger-spin, wrist-spin, left arm (pace) when Starcy comes back online.

Look at physical fortitude and not mental fragility for answers,Finishing fumbles come either from flagging stamina or from trying to rush towards victory. But both are symptoms of not being physically prepared for the long haul.,"Ashmita Chaliha had 5 match points against Danish Line Kjaersfeldt at the Thailand Super 300 on Thursday, playing the decider. She blew them all, losing the set 29-27 and the match 21-19, 13-21, 27-29. She had started well taking the opener, and then come up short at finishing.

"Why Enzo Fernandez’s British transfer-fee record is part soap opera, part circus and part reality show","The ripple effect would be dramatic. If Chelsea can splurge, Manchester City would feel they could splurge. Liverpool and Manchester United, with potential new owners six months from now, would not be far behind.","Less than six months after Manchester United turned down an offer from River Plate to sign the promising Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernandez for a reported fee of 20 million pound, a pittance by cash-fizzing Premier League standards, their rivals Chelsea acquired him for a head-spinning 107 million pounds, a British transfer fee record, which probably would be shattered in less than six months when the next window rolls up the shutters.
Between now and then, a lot has changed for Fernandez. Benfica signed him for nine million pounds, some genius in the Portuguese club had foreseen greatness twinkling on his toes that he inserted a 107 million pounds release clause in his contract, Fernandez dazzled in the World Cup with thunderous strikes, flowing passion and slick passing, won the tournament in his maiden appearance, hoarded applause from childhood hero Lionel Messi, and now finds himself as the most twinkling jewel in the collection of Chelsea’s new owner Todd Boehly. The American business man seems to be so driven by unbound commerce that his six months of spending could make his predecessor, the Ukraine oligarch Roman Abramovich blush. The club has forked out 600 million pounds since his takeover. Whoever claimed that American owners are spendthrifts, money-guzzling sharks!
As ridiculous as this sum seems for a player that shot to limelight just a month ago, with only 70 career league appearances, Fernandez’s was not a panic buy or a whim or fancy. Boehly has hired some of the finest players recruiters in Europe. Technical director of recruitment and talent Christopher Vivell and co-director have worked with Red Bull chain of clubs, the hottest talent producing factory in Europe. Part of the group are Lawrence Stewart, who has worked with Red Bull as well as Monaco, where he helped unearth the French midfield wizard Christopher Nkunku, the director of global Talent and transfers Paul Winstanley, who was the brain behind the emergence of relegation-scrapers Brighton as a competitive force. Surely, they might have pored over hundreds of footages, listened to as many inputs from scouts and technical staff of the teams he has played for or against before squeezing into the shop just before the windows were rolled down.
His purchase soared the gross spent of the January window, a phase when most teams are circumspect when spreeing, to a staggering 815 million pounds, double the previous records of 430 million pounds in 2018 and three-fold the amount in previous January window (£295m). Both windows combined, teams shelled out two million pounds, a runaway record. The heights of ambition of clubs are getting higher by the year, foolproof to the fickleness of global recession, mounting inflation and post-lockdown austerity. But more than the money, what baffles is the drama that unfolds during the transfer window, more dramatic than the battle for the league title, which has been one-sided for several years.
The deadline-day is an entity in itself, when negotiators spend endless hours brokering a deal, when scribes keep buzzing their sources for the information-nudge, when fans wait eagerly for updates on Twitter handles and news websites. Then the last hour u-turning of plans, last-minute coups, last-second meltdowns, teams playing hardball, agents acting pricey on the bargaining table, and suitors acting pricier. So much so that it could be as dramatic as the World Cup final in Qatar. Then the hurried medicals, rushed unveiling, as though all of these were a deliberate, broader plan to kill mid-league slumber.
Chelsea’s Enzo Fernandez reacts. (AP Photo)
The Fernandez saga that raged on for most of January is a textbook case. Chelsea had expressed their interest as soon as the 22-year-old was adjudged the best young player of the World Cup. So were other clubs, only to be dissuaded by the hefty release clause that Benfica were adamant on meeting. Chelsea attempted a backdoor barge-in, by making the player agree personal terms and thus force the club into selling him. Only for the club to cash in on Chelsea’s indiscretion, and publicly denigrate them. “It’s disrespectful against all of us,” manager Roger Schmidt would say. “So to make the player crazy and then pretend they can pay the clause and later they want to negotiate, I think it’s not what I understand about a good relationship between clubs who maybe want to discuss a player,” he lashed at Chelsea’s negotiating tactics.

Then one day, Fernandez stopped coming for practice. When the deal seemed hitting a rough road, he resumed training, made a couple of appearances and even managed to score a goal. Then there are the tales of the transfers that did not happen for the most bizarre reasons. Like Zimbabwean international Benjani Mwaruwari could not attend the medicals in time for a move to Manchester City because he missed a flight because he had fallen asleep. Another story goes that Turkish agent Dr. Erkut Sogut was forced to sort out a transfer from hospital while his wife was giving birth. “My second son is born and I have this photo where they have given me my newborn baby and I’m holding him while still on the phone – I don’t even look at my son, all the interest is in finishing this deal. Finally one hour later it was finished – it was the craziest day of my life,” he recollected to Daily Mirror.

The ripple effect would be dramatic. If Chelsea can splurge, Manchester City would feel they could splurge. Liverpool and Manchester United, with potential new owners six months from now, would not be far behind.
Surely Fernandez’s record could be as fleeting as Jack Grealish’s was. Well, who is Jack Grealish exactly? The custard-blonde forward who played 81 minutes across five games in the World Cup and who does not start for the club that whipped up 100 millions pounds to procure his services.

Without Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, the responsibility of shouldering the PSG attack was sorely on the shoulders of the World Cup winner and he did not disappoint.
Messi curled in an exquisite goal into the bottom corner from outside the area in the 58th minute and put PSG 2-1 ahead, helping the hosts recover from a woeful start where they conceded first. The Argentine also came close to completing his brace in stoppage time only to hit the post. This was his third goal in his last five league games and it put PSG on 54 points from 22 games.

Ranji Trophy: All-round Bhut takes five-for as Saurashtra beat Punjab to enter semi-final,The match will haunt Punjab for a long time as they had Saurashtra on the mat on the first day at 147 for 8 before Bhut's 111 took them to 303.,"Parth Bhut capped off a dream game with a five-wicket haul after game-changing century and half-century as Saurashtra won a memorable Ranji Trophy quarter-final against Punjab by 71 runs on Saturday to set up a semi-final date with Karnataka.
Needing 252 to win, Punjab started the day at 52 for 2 and were all out for 180 in 89.1 overs with veteran Mandeep Singh’s 45 being the highest score.
Mandeep, a veteran of 13 seasons, failed to show any intent and his selfish, ultra-defensive 128-ball stay put Punjab in a hole.
The match will haunt Punjab for a long time as they had Saurashtra on the mat on the first day at 147 for 8 before Bhut’s 111 took them to 303. Punjab then scored 431 in their first essay with twin hundreds from Naman Dhir and Prabhsimran Singh but allowed Saurashtra to score 379 in second innings and put up a defendable total.
Once young Pukhraj Mann was out for 42, trapped leg before by off-spinner Yuvraj Dodiya (2/35 in 18 overs), Mandeep never showed any aggressive streak as left-arm spin twins Bhut (5/89 in 33 overs) and Dharmendra Jadeja (3/56 in 38.1 overs) choked the run-flow.
He did have a 49-run stand for the sixth wicket with Anmolpreet Singh (26) but the two senior players crawled for 21 overs and it was just a matter of one wicket.
Anmolpreet was offie Dodiya’s second victim caught by Snell Patel.
Mandeep was finally out when Vishvaraj Jadeja took a close-in catch off a Bhut delivery that bounced a tad more.
Once Mandeep was gone, there was no looking back for the 2020-21 champions Saurashtra who were without their inspirational skipper Jaydev Unadkat, team’s numero uno batter Cheteshwar Pujara and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.
ADVERTISEMENT
SCA president Jaydev Shah told PTI that he will request BCCI and Indian team management to release Unadkat for the semi-final starting February 8 in Bengaluru in case he is not considered for the playing XI of the first Test against Australia.
“We had even requested the BCCI for the quarter-final. We will request again for Jaydev but I will not lose my sleep if we don’t get him. Look at how our youngsters like Parth shouldered extra responsibility. We came from behind and beat a team like Punjab in a big game,” Shah said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-all-round-bhut-takes-five-for-as-saurashtra-beat-punjab-to-enter-semi-final-8424438/,sports
Caddie for amateur at Pebble Beach collapses during tourney,"The PGA Tour did not release his name. Early reports were the caddie's condition was improving. He was working for Pebble Beach businessman Geoff Couch, who did not return to finish the round.","The caddie for an amateur in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am collapsed on the 11th fairway, and CPR was performed on him until an ambulance arrived to take him to the hospital.
In a tournament known for its easy vibe with celebrities and scenery, the final three hours at Pebble Beach took on a somber tone, particularly those on and around the 11th hole when the caddie fell over on Friday.
The PGA Tour did not release his name. Early reports were the caddie’s condition was improving. He was working for Pebble Beach businessman Geoff Couch, who did not return to finish the round.
“I turn around and he’s on the ground and I ran over to him and turned him over,” said country singer Lukas Nelson, the other amateur in the group.
“And he didn’t have a lot of color in him. Luckily, there was a police officer on the sideline. He knew CPR so he came in and effectively saved his life.” Gary Young, the PGA Tour’s chief referee, said a spectator began the CPR and an officer from Cal Fire took over from there.
PGA Tour players Beau Hossler and Max McGreevy, after consultation with PGA Tour officials, chose not to speak to reporters out of respect to the caddie’s family.
“It was especially jarring, the weirdest thing that can happen on a golf course,” Nelson said.

“The good news is he’s at the moment doing better. From my perspective, it seemed like we lost him. And he’s still with us, so that’s important.” After consulting with a PGA Tour rules official, Hossler and McGreevy marked their golf balls on the 11th hole and returned to the clubhouse. They were able to warm up and returned to the 11th hole after every group had come through to finish the round.
Harry Higgs was playing two groups behind and saw it all unfold. It brought back memories of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who suffered a cardiac arrest during a Monday Night Football game against Cincinnati and had to be resuscitated on the field.
“It had some shades of that,” Higgs said. “I was standing on the tee. They looked like they were 250 yards away, maybe even less, and they were hammering away CPR on the gentleman. It was weird.” The groups behind, which included retired All-Pro receiver Larry Fitzgerald, played through as the tour figured out what the players wanted to do.
“We teed off on 11 and once I got up there and saw the group that the caddie was in, they were off to the side and they were obviously very emotional, hugging each other,” Higgs said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I called a rules official over and just wanted to like, Is this OK? I don’t want to be rude and keep going.’ It’s like golf doesn’t matter at all now, right?” Nelson wasn’t sure he wanted to return, a feeling shared by others, except for getting good reports on the caddie’s improved condition.
“I think everybody on property knew what had happened and everybody was flat,” Higgs said.
“There was no energy, no juice on any of the holes coming in. … Fortunately, we got some good news and kept going. I hope there’s more good news in the coming hours and days. Just very difficult and kind of a first — hopefully, a last.” Two years, caddie Alberto Olguin collapsed on the ninth tee during a PGA Tour Latinoamerica event and died an hour later at a hosptial in Mexico.
In 2016, the first round of a Ladies European Tour event in Dubai was suspended when caddie Max Zechmann collapsed on the 13th fairway and died at a nearby hospital.

At the 2014 Madeira Island Open on the European Tour, caddie Ian MacGregor collapsed and died on the ninth hole while working for Alastair Forsyth.

The Brazil international was sent off in the second half for grabbing Palace midfielder Will Hughes by the neck and will now serve a three-match ban for violent conduct.
United is already without Christian Eriksen for the majority of the rest of the season because of an ankle injury and must now cope with the loss of another influential midfielder.

Casemiro was sent off in the 70th minute, shortly after Marcus Rashford had put Erik ten Hag’s team 2-0 up.
Following a tussle between both sets of players on the sideline, VAR asked referee Andre Marriner to review the footage of Casemiro and the decision was a straight red.
His absence was immediately felt as Palace set up a tense finish, with Jeffrey Schlupp scoring six minutes after Casemiro’s dismissal.
Bruno Fernandes had opened the scoring early on from the penalty spot and United looked set to cruise to victory when Rashford added a second.
But in front an increasingly nervous Old Trafford crowd, Palace dominated once the home team was reduced to 10 men.

Streaking Brentford see off Southampton 3-0 to rise in EPL
Brentford moved into the English Premier League top six after dispatching Southampton 3-0 on Saturday.
Goals by Ben Mee, Bryan Mbeumo and Mathias Jensen extended Brentford’s unbeaten run to nine in the league stretching back to October.
Their fluid front four of Josh Dasilva, Ivan Toney, Yoane Wissa and Mbeumo simply tormented the Southampton defense.
Southampton was game for 40 minutes then capitulated.

The goal the hosts were threatening arrived when Mbeumo spun out of trouble on the left wing and swung in a cross which Mee met with a powerful header.
Mee also banged heads with defender Mohammed Salisu and both needed prolonged treatment. When play restarted, the Bees doubled their lead with another clinical, sweeping attack.

Using the outside of his left boot like a pitching wedge, Dasilva spread the ball out wide to Wissa, who cut inside and provided a low cross for Mbeumo to tap in.
As disgruntled Saints fans took out their frustration on manager Nathan Jones, Brentford piled on the misery with 10 minutes to go when Rico Henry’s cross was headed in by Jensen to wrap up another impressive win.
One of Jones’ substitutions was met with a chorus of “You don’t know what you’re doing.” After the third goal, the mood worsened with “You’re getting sacked in the morning” and “Nathan Jones, get out of our club” ringing out from one angry corner of the ground.

"Davis Cup: India relegated to World Group 2 as Holger Rune, Denmark stamp their class",The World No. 9 won three of three matches as India lost to Denmark 1-3.,"India slumped to a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Denmark in a Davis Cup playoff tie, relegating the side to World Group 2 of the competition for the first time since the format change in 2019.
It was World No. 9 Holger Rune who proved to be the difference for the Danes. India’s bold team selection on the first day paid off, as Sumit Nagal was able to defeat August Holmgren in three sets on Friday to tie the score 1-1 after Yuki Bhambri’s 6-2, 6-2 loss to Rune.
On Saturday, with scores even and doubles veteran Rohan Bopanna, fresh off his run to the Australian Open mixed doubles final, on their side, India had the upper hand in the doubles rubber. However, just as it was against Norway in their World Group 1 tie last year, a disappointing defeat followed.
Bopanna and Bhambri partnered each other to face Rune, who was subbed in at the last minute after Nagal’s singles win, and Johannes Ingildsen. Despite being the more experienced and accomplished pairing, the duo lost in straight sets.
Rune and Ingildsen got off to a brilliant start, winning four games in a row, and did not look back for the rest of the first set. The Indian duo were broken early in the second set too, but ground out a way back into the match by breaking back immediately, only to lose serve the following game. The Danish pair served it out for a 6-2, 6-4 win from there on.
Rune led from the front once again, shrugging off the fatigue from the doubles match, to come back on court and play Nagal in what was the decisive match for Denmark. He got off to an excellent start by breaking Nagal’s serve, only to lose his own. The Indian looked in good touch, showing glimpses of the form he was in a few years ago as the last Indian singles player to be in the main draw of a Grand Slam, before injuries derailed his 2022 season.
With a firing forehand and solid attacking tactics, Nagal broke Rune’s serve in the fifth game of the first set, but fell off from there as Rune found another gear. Nagal was broken as he served for the first set, and then lost three games in a row to lose the first set.
ADVERTISEMENT
He found a way into Rune’s serve again immediately, in the opening game of the second set, but failed to convert two break points. Rune did not look back from there, rounding out a 7-5, 6-3 win – his third of three matches in the tie – to take Denmark back into World Group 1.
India will now play the winner of the World Group 2 playoff in September.

Raina surprised with Australia’s decision to not play warm-up games,"The Australian team are currently training in Bengaluru and are practising on rank turners, having summoned little known Baroda spinner Mahesh Pithiya, whose bowling action resembles Ravichandran Ashwin.","Former India batter Suresh Raina is baffled by Australian team’s decision to opt for simulation training rather than play warm-up games ahead of the first Border-Gavaskar Test, starting February 9 in Nagpur.
The Australian team are currently training in Bengaluru and are practising on rank turners, having summoned little known Baroda spinner Mahesh Pithiya, whose bowling action resembles Ravichandran Ashwin.
But Raina, one of India’s finest white ball players, feels that Australia might have missed a trick.
“I have played practice matches (ahead of Tests) and they are really important. They (Australia) can understand the quality of pitches in India only if they play on them,” Raina told PTI on the sidelines of Mission Olympics Annual Day Meet, organised by Police Families Welfare Society.
Raina is confident that India will do well in the four-Test series and Ravindra Jadeja’s comeback will add fine balance to the squad.
“I am happy with Jadeja’s comeback after a long time,” said the southpaw.
“Our spinners R Ashwin, Axar Patel are doing well. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been in good form and I think we will get to watch an interesting series in the coming days.” While visiting teams are always welcomed on rank turners during Test matches in the sub-continent, Raina would like to see a track that would hold on for five days.
He however didn’t want to predict the outcome of the series. “Let it begin first. A Test match should be five-day long. I will only comment (on performance) after watching the first day and seeing the focus of players.” Raina is very happy that there is so much competition for places in the national team across formats.

“It is an achievement (that many are worthy of a place in the Indian team). When there is such a competition we will get the best performance from the players.” He also welcomed BCCI’s decision to organise the inaugural Women’s Premier League (WPL).

Akhtar had bowled a 161.3 kmph delivery against England at the 2003 World Cup.","Former Pakistan pacer Sohail Khan who has been making headlines for sharing his exchange between himself and Virat Kohli during the 2015 World Cup India-Pakistan group stage match, said that bowlers like Umran Malik are in abundance in the Pakistan domestic circuit.
“Only a bowling machine can break Shoaib Akhtar’s record (of the fastest ball). A human being can’t I feel. Umran Malik guy is a good bowler. I’ve seen 1-2 matches and he runs fast and has kept other things is check as well. But if you think of fast bowlers with speed in excess of over 150-155 kph, I can count 12-15 players right now who play tape-ball cricket. If you go visit the trails organized by Lahore Qalandars, you’ll find many players,” Sohail said on The Nadir Ali podcast on asked if Malik can break Shoaib Akhtar’s record.

Davis Cup: Bopanna-Bhambri pair loses in straight sets,The Danish pair made short work of the Indians winning 6-2 6-4 in just 65 minutes as Rune's presence proved to be a decisive factor.,"Indian duo Rohan Bopanna and Yuki Bhambri lost to world number 9 Holger Rune and Johannes Ingildsen in straight sets to hand hosts Denmark a 2-1 lead after the doubles tie in the Davis Cup World Group Play-Off on Saturday.
The Danish pair made short work of the Indians winning 6-2 6-4 in just 65 minutes as Rune’s presence proved to be a decisive factor.
Earlier on Friday, India’s number one Sumit Nagal had erased a one-set deficit to pip August Holmgren 4-6 6-3 6-4 in two hours and 27 minutes. Nagal restored the parity after Bhambri had a forgettable opening singles losing 2-6 2-6 to the rising teen sensation Rune.
Bhambri has quit singles and now plays only doubles on tour.
The 25-year-old Nagal, ranked 506, dropped serve in the very first game of the match but once he got hold of his nerves, he was his usual fighting self.
He got the break back but squandered the chances when Holmgren offered them.
The Danish player, ranked 484, eventually sealed the set.
In the second set, it was Nagal who drew the first blood and went up 5-2. He served out the set in the ninth game to force a decider.
Nagal had a chance to get the first break when he made a deep return and Holmgren’s forehand return sailed over the baseline at 30-all but the home player served well to save the chance.

Nagal got another chance when Holmgren netted a forehand at deuce point in the third game but he himself made a forehand error on the breakpoint.
While Nagal preferred to hit from the baseline, Holmgren charged the net often to create chances for volley winners.
Holmgren handed Nagal another break chance when he tried to pick a low volley but could not keep the ball in the court and followed that up with a double fault, allowing the Indian to take a mini 3-2 lead.
That lead stayed with Nagal and he came out serving for the match in the 10th game. Holmgren’s forehand error gave the Indian three match points and converted the first one on home team player’s unforced error.

In the opening singles, Rune broke Bhambri twice in each set. The 19-year-old converted four of the seven break chances while the Indian did not get a single chance to break his opponent.

Perth Scorchers edge Brisbane Heat in BBL final to retain title,"The fifth-ranked Heat, who performed valiantly throughout the finals series, posted 175-7 from their 20 overs after opting to bat, but the reigning champions proved too strong and worked their way to 178-5 with four balls remaining.","Perth Scorchers’ 19-year-old Cooper Connolly smashed an unbeaten 25 to see his side over the line in a nail-biting five-wicket win against Brisbane Heat who retained their crown in the Big Bash League (BBL) season decider at Perth Stadium on Saturday.
The fifth-ranked Heat, who performed valiantly throughout the finals series, posted 175-7 from their 20 overs after opting to bat, but the reigning champions proved too strong and worked their way to 178-5 with four balls remaining.
Perth Scorchers extended their BBL dominance to five titles from 12 editions.

With his team requiring 39 from 19 balls, Connolly, playing in only his fourth Twenty20, walked to the crease and assumed responsibility for the chase, living dangerously as he hammered two enormous sixes and a four.
Defending 10 from the final over, Heat seamer Michael Neser conceded multiple boundaries to Nick Hobson (18 not out) who iced the match.
The Scorchers response began strongly until a lazy piece of running saw Stephen Eskinazi (21) short of his crease.
The workmanlike Heat bowling attack hit good lengths through the first 10 overs, conceding 67-3 and pushing the required run rate above 10.
Captain Ashton Turner, responsible for several rescue acts this season, clubbed five boundaries and two sixes to keep the match on a knife-edge, supported by Josh Inglis (26).

When Turner was run-out for 53, Connolly and Hobson’s breathtaking partnership swung the match.
Earlier, opener Josh Brown got the Heat off to a rollicking start, belting 25 runs in the first two overs of the match before being caught. Sam Heazlett (34) and Nathan McSweeney (41) then consolidated to create a solid foundation for the innings.
Aggressive use of the batting powerplay in the 13th over backfired though and both Heazlett and skipper Jimmy Peirson (3) swiped Jason Behrendorff (2-26) to short fine leg.

After crunching a late 31 from 14 balls, Max Bryant skied a short Matt Kelly (2-37) delivery to keeper Inglis. The same fate awaited Neser, architect of Heat’s semi-final chase against Sydney Sixers, one ball later as he went for a golden duck.
Both sides entered the match short of star-power as injuries and international call-ups took their toll.

1500 players to take part in Khelo India Winter Games in Jammu and Kashmir: Thakur,Thakur said the athletes from all over the country participating in Khelo India Winter Games will not only encourage J and K youth towards sports but will also promote tourism in the Union Territory.,"Sports Minister Anurag Thakur on Saturday said 1500 athletes from across the country will take part in the Khelo India Winter Games, scheduled to start in the famous ski resort of Gulmarg in North Kashmir from February 10.
Thakur said the athletes from all over the country participating in Khelo India Winter Games will not only encourage J and K youth towards sports but will also promote tourism in the Union Territory.
“The players and officials enchanted by the beauty of Kashmir and the changes that have been brought about in J and K from the last many years will become brand ambassadors promoting J&K tourism, peace and tranquility,” he said.
Thakur was speaking after he and Lt Governor Manoj Sinha launched the third Khelo India Winter Games mascot, theme song and jersey at the Raj Bhavan here.
He said the launch of Khelo India Winter Games sends a message across the country that J&K is waiting for the people to watch this event, which is expected to provide an unforgettable experience.
Sinha said sports infrastructure has reached every nook and corner of J&K which is encouraging youth towards sports.
“Every panchayat of J&K has sports facilities and the target of engaging 50 lakh youth in sports activities has been surpassed. Through new sports policy, attractive career options will be provided to the sportspersons,” he said.

The Winter Games, which will have nine sports disciplines in action, are scheduled to be held from February 10 to 14.
The first edition of the Khelo India Winter Games took place in 2020.

Skriniar no longer Inter captain says Inzaghi ahead of Milan derby,"Skriniar, who has made nearly 250 appearances for Inter since joining the club in 2017, was linked with a January move to Paris St Germain but the two clubs did not work out a deal before the transfer window closed on Tuesday.","Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar will no longer wear the captain’s armband, manager Simone Inzaghi said on Saturday, with the Slovakia international set to run down his contract and leave the Serie A club for free at the end of the season.
Skriniar, who has made nearly 250 appearances for Inter since joining the club in 2017, was linked with a January move to Paris St Germain but the two clubs did not work out a deal before the transfer window closed on Tuesday.
Inter had reportedly rejected bids of more than 50 million euros ($53.97 million) last year but will now lose the 27-year-old for free in the close season.
“I do not judge his choices, but I judge the man and the player. He is a wonderful guy, he works very well every day. He will probably be a starter in the game,” Inzaghi told reporters ahead of Sunday’s derby against AC Milan.
“Regarding the captain’s armband, we have hierarchies. Because of what happened, Skriniar will no longer be the captain, but it was discussed quietly with the club and the boy.
“The captain is Samir Handanovic, then there are also others like Marcelo Brozovic and Lautaro Martinez.”
Inter are second in the standings — 13 points adrift of runaway leaders Napoli — while Milan are fifth, two points behind their city rivals.

Milan have not won in four league games and were beaten 3-0 by Inter in Italy’s Supercup, but Inzaghi is not taking things lightly against the league champions.
“Well, clearly derbies are all stories in themselves. In this year-and-a-half we’ve played so many, six of them. The cup matches allowed us to win two important trophies, the league games were disappointments,” he said.
Milan have won their last two Serie A derbies against Inter and are looking to make it three in a row for the first time since four straight league victories between 2002 and 2004.
After Milan prevailed 3-2 in the reverse fixture back in September, they could also do a league double over Inter for the first time since the 2010-11 campaign.

“Derbies are special matches,” added Inzaghi. “Milan is in a moment that is not positive, but we’re talking about the Italian champions which made it to the Champions League last-16 after a long time.

“The last time we went I’m pretty sure we got served up a green-top (to practice on) and it was sort of irrelevant. We’re better off having our own nets and getting spinners in and bowling as much as they can. We’ll wait and see when we hit the ground.

Green might have an ‘outside chance’ of playing Nagpur Test: Australia coach McDonald,"The 23-year-old seam bowling all-rounder, who is recovering from a surgery on his index finger in his right hand, had a bowl at the nets in Alur.","Dashing all-rounder Cameron Green is making a quick recovery from his index finger injury and has an “outside chance” of making it to Australia’s playing eleven for the opening Test against India starting in Nagpur on February 9.
The 23-year-old seam bowling all-rounder, who is recovering from a surgery on his index finger in his right hand, had a bowl at the nets in Alur.
“We haven’t put a clear line through him on the team sheet. So, I wouldn’t say he was in discomfort when he was bowling,” McDonald told reporters here on the sidelines of their four-day training camp.
However there are still some concerns when he is batting, admitted the head coach.
“I would say one of the deliveries jarred the bottom of the bat and that can create discomfort for anyone, but there is a little bit of awareness around that finger. He has made some significant steps forward in the last couple of days, probably to my surprise.
“So, there is still an outside chance, everything going well, he might be on the team sheet,” McDonald kept the options open.
Skipper Pat Cummins had earlier ruled out Green from bowling in the Test should he play, but McDonald said he has made significant progress.
Green’s inclusion would provide Australia with an opportunity to include an extra specialist spinner in their bid to win their first Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India since 2004.

McDonald further said their explosive opener David Warner is fully “recharged” and looking forward to make amends for his poor runs in some of the previous tours in the upcoming Test series.
The 36-year-old, who has a poor record of averaging 24.25 in eights Tests in India, had complained of exhaustion and said he would have preferred the night off from the Cricket Australia awards to recover from a busy home summer.
“I haven’t noticed any fatigue in David Warner since I got here,” McDonald said.
“I would probably dispel that as a bit of a myth. He has had a couple of days off… he has been there (at training) for one of the two days, and he is not there today.” “We are managing each individual coming in around their specific preparation and where they have been and there is no doubt it was a demanding summer into BBL, and it creates a challenge back into Test match cricket.
ADVERTISEMENT
“But we feel the preparation we have him on he will be recharged and ready to go. It has been well documented he hasn’t had the series that he would like. It’s always challenging.

We’ve plenty of options in spin department: Cummins,The touring Australians have named Mitchell Swepson along with finger spinner Ashton Agar to team up with Lyon.,"Australia captain Pat Cummins on Saturday said his team is not fretting over its spin combination as it has enough options to support veteran off-spinner Nathan Lyon in the high-profile four-match Test series against India beginning in Nagpur on Thursday.
The touring Australians have named Mitchell Swepson along with finger spinner Ashton Agar to team up with Lyon.
“We’ve got plenty of options here (with) finger spin, wrist spin, left arm (pace) when (Mitchell) Starcy comes back,” Cummins told reporters in his first media interaction after arriving in India.
“We’ll obviously pick the bowlers that we think are going to take 20 wickets. But how we split that up, we’re not 100 per cent sure yet.” Asked if it would be a two-pronged spin attack, he said: “I wouldn’t say it’s a given. Obviously it’s very conditions dependent.
Particularly in the first test, once we get to Nagpur we will see that.” The Australians are here for a training camp before heading to Nagpur on Monday.
“The good thing is someone like Agar was in our last team, Swepson played the last two overseas tour, so a bit of experience.
“Murphy played in the last tour. We feel that we got a lot of support in that department for Lyon.” The 29-year-old Cummins pointed out that middle-order batter Travis Head also offers off-spin option.

“Travis Head also bowls really good offspin. We have to balance things. We have got a plenty of variety there to choose from. We have not locked in any bowling line-up so far.” While there is so much talk about spin bowling, Cummins said his side should not forget about their intimidating pace bowling attack.
“I think sometimes, talking about a couple of spinners, you forget how good a lot of our fast bowlers have been in all conditions.
“Even some of the SCG wickets, there haven’t been a lot in them for quick bowlers, but the quick bowlers have found a way,” he added.
Cummins has come a long way since he made a Test comeback after six years in Ranchi during the last tour of India in 2017.
ADVERTISEMENT
An injury-prone Cummins then dished out a hostile spell to dismiss the star Indian trio of KL Rahul, Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane en route to figures of 4/106.
“It was my first test in six years. I just wanted to reaffirm that’s where I wanted to be in Test cricket. I really enjoyed that spell, you can’t be worried about your body or different things. You just got to go all out. I really enjoyed that.
“Test cricket can be really, really harsh. you have got to accept that it’s going to be grinding times, and you got to be out for it and embrace that challenge. Coming here to India when a lot of the talks are around, big spinning wicket, it’s not always the case.

Olympic echoes of boycott era as Ukraine vs IOC intensifies,Ukraine fired up its campaign on Friday to have Russia and military ally Belarus excluded from the next Summer Games with talk in Kyiv of a boycott and support from sympathetic governments in the Baltics and elsewhere in Europe.,"A contest that could define the 2024 Paris Olympics is playing out 18 months before medals are awarded. It’s giving the International Olympic Committee a political challenge with echoes of the 1980s.
Ukraine fired up its campaign on Friday to have Russia and military ally Belarus excluded from the next Summer Games with talk in Kyiv of a boycott and support from sympathetic governments in the Baltics and elsewhere in Europe.
The IOC responded in a statement that “it is regretful that politicians are misusing athletes and sport as tools to achieve their political objectives.” Pushback has been fierce in the 10 days since the IOC set out its preferred path for Russian and Belarusian athletes who do not actively support the war to try to qualify for Paris as neutrals.
By citing human rights arguments — that no athlete should face discrimination just for the passport they hold — the IOC has seemed ready to punish the protesting parties rather than the aggressors in the war.
The IOC has pointed to its own rules and Olympic history to make its case.
OLYMPIC CHARTER
It is the document of rules that “governs the organization, action and operation of the Olympic Movement and sets forth the conditions for the celebration of the Olympic Games.” It does say that each of 206 national Olympic committees (NOCs) is obliged to participate in the Olympic Games by sending athletes.
What it does not say is any kind of clear framework for acting against Russia and Belarus in the current situation.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There is nothing in the Olympic Charter saying if a government starts a war that is opposed by the U.N. then the NOC has to be suspended,” said Sylvia Schenk, a lawyer and sports governance expert from Germany who advises the IOC on human rights.
OLYMPIC BOYCOTTS
Any NOC can choose to boycott an Olympics on a point of honestly held principle — knowing that in Lausanne the act will not easily be forgotten or forgiven.
No team has boycotted the Olympics since North Korea snubbed the neighboring South for the 1988 Seoul Summer Games.
That closed a different period in Olympic history after significant boycotts at each Summer Games from 1976 through 1984.
ADVERTISEMENT
A swath of African countries stayed away from Montreal in 1976 because New Zealand would be there soon after its iconic rugby team toured South Africa.
The United States led the largest boycott in 1980. More than 60 teams refused to go to Moscow after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
IOC president Thomas Bach was among the West Germany athletes who could not go, denying him the chance to defend the team fencing title.
Payback four years later saw the Los Angeles Olympics snubbed by the Soviet Union and Eastern European allies.
ADVERTISEMENT
The boycott era almost fatally damaged the Olympic brand and is seared on the memory of Bach who has presided over an era of continued commercial success.
OLYMPIC BANS
Most famously, South Africa was banned by the IOC from competing at any Olympics from 1964-88 because of its apartheid system of racial discrimination laws.
Critics of the IOC’s current stance on Russia point to the South African case. The IOC’s counter point is that South Africa was under U.N. sanctions and Russia currently is not. Russia is a U.N. Security Council member and can veto proposed resolutions.
North Korea was excluded from the Beijing Winter Games held one year ago as punishment for not sending a team to the Tokyo Summer Games in July 2021. North Korea claimed it was protecting athletes from the COVID-19 pandemic.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bach said in September 2021 when issuing the ban that taking part in the Olympics can “show to the world how it could look like if everybody would respect the same rules, if everybody would live together peacefully without any kind of discrimination.” Afghanistan could be banned from Paris next year for denying women and girls the right to play sport. The Charter says “every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination.” The IOC was urged by the World Anti-Doping Agency to issue a blanket ban on Russia less than a month before the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
A hectic lead-in to those Olympics saw WADA-appointed investigator Richard McLaren detail the Russian state-backed doping scheme at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.
After the IOC pledged to explore legal options, it instead asked governing bodies of individual Olympic sports to decide within days how, and which, Russian athletes could be eligible for Rio. A flurry of appeals went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
A similar scenario of legal uncertainty could play out before Russians and Belarusians compete in Paris, sports law academic Antoine Duval cautioned on Friday.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It would be very political and very ad hoc, and with different types of approaches to the issue,” Duval told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
NEUTRAL STATUS
The IOC’s suggested option of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in Paris as neutral athletes without their flag, anthem or national team name has precedent.
It’s how individual Yugoslavians, but not teams, could compete as independent athletes at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics during the civil war in the Balkans. U.N. sanctions were in force then.
Kuwait competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag in 2016 because of a relatively trivial issue of a government-backed sports law that was unacceptable to the IOC.
ADVERTISEMENT
Fallout from the Russian doping scandal has meant teams at the past three Olympics starting in 2018 competed under supposedly neutral names — Olympic Athlete from Russia, and ROC (for Russian Olympic Committee) — without flag and anthem.
Dressed in distinctively Russian colors of red, white and blue, however, it was a compromise unsatisfactory to many. Any Russians competing in Paris will likely be dressed in genuinely neutral colors.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/olympic-echoes-of-boycott-era-as-ukraine-vs-ioc-intensifies-8423931/,sports

"Wickets with the new ball, close-in catching, early runs: Greg Chappell lists how Australia can take advantage of ‘vulnerable’ India","In a column for The Sydney Morning Herald, the former India coach said that injuries to key players has made India vulnerable at home for the first time in many years.","Former Australia test captain and India coach Greg Chapell said that Australia have a better chance of winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India, since the injury-induced absence of key players like Ravindra Jadeja, Rishabh Pant, and Jasprit Bumrah have made the team “vulnerable”.
In a column he wrote for The Sydney Morning Herald titled ‘How test cricket in India is the ultimate game of chess’, Chappell pointed out the size of the task to successfully navigate test cricket in India – Australia have not won a test series in India since 2004, and haven’t beaten India in an away test since 2015.
Chappell listed the areas which Australia will have to execute well in order to be able to win the series. The first and foremost, was taking wickets with the new ball. “Partnerships are the key, so they must prevent India from building them. To win, Australia must get wickets with the new ball,” he said. “As the ball gets softer, they must bowl frugally and then reverse-swing the old ball.”
Much of the buildup has been dominated by spin-friendly pitches that are likely to be curated by India for the series. Chappell said that regardless of the conditions, Australia must play their four best bowlers alongside allrounder Cameron Green, whose absence in the first test due to injury will make the selection of the second spinner, in addition to Nathan Lyon, crucial.
“On good batting wickets, Mitch Swepson should be the choice. Should the pitches favour spin, which is more likely, I expect Ashton Agar to get the nod because finger spin is considered to be more accurate,” he said.
For Lyon, undoubtedly one of Australia’s most crucial players on the turners in India, Chappell advised him to follow in the footsteps of “arguably the best off-spinner of all-time” Erapalli Prasanna, whose brain Chappell was able to pick over dinner back in 2006.
“I asked him (Prasanna) what was his plan (for) a new batsman? He said he would spin the ball hard, try to hit him on the pads often, get him thinking about the spinning ball, and then trap him on the crease with a straight one,” he said. “As the leader of the spin attack, Nathan Lyon will need to take pages out of his book and show the way.”

Considering the spinning tracks, Chappell said catching in the slips would be critical, with Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne doing well close-in to the wicket, but with others needing practice for it too. “The Indian close catchers create wickets for their spinners with their anticipation and agility which Australia will do well to replicate,” he said.
Tours to India can make or break batting careers: Chappell
Chappell highlighted the issues Australia’s batting lineup faces: David Warner’s form in India, Labuschagne being untested in the subcontinent, Smith’s new-look technique needing a test, and other concerns.
Emphasising that high totals in the first innings will be essential for Australia, he said that while chilly mornings may be good news for Australia’s pacers, the ball will stay low and slow, out of the comfort zone for much of Australia’s batting lineup.

“Hitting across the line is a risky pursuit in these conditions. Australians who are used to the extra bounce to generate pace with the bottom hand consequently struggle on the slower, lower pitches,” Chappell added, before proclaiming: “Tours to India can make or break batting careers.”

Davis Cup: Nagal brings India back with close win after Yuki’s defeat,It was always a tall task for Bhambri to counter world number nine Holger Rune and there was no surprise as Denmark's top singles player raced to a 6-2 6-2 win to put the hosts up 1-0 on Friday.,"Sumit Nagal brought India back in the Davis Cup World Group Play-off tie against Denmark with a come-from-behind victory in the second singles after Yuki Bhambri was outplayed in the opening match.
It was always a tall task for Bhambri to counter world number nine Holger Rune and there was no surprise as Denmark’s top singles player raced to a 6-2 6-2 win to put the hosts up 1-0 on Friday.
Up against a formidable rival, Yuki needed a special effort but he went down in mere 58 minutes.
Nagal, India’s number one player, though erased a one-set deficit to pip August Holmgren 4-6 6-3 6-4 in two hours and 27 minutes to make it 1-1 at the end of day one.
The 25-year-old Nagal, ranked 506, dropped serve in the very first game of the match but once he got hold of his nerves, he was his usual fighting self.
He got the break back but squandered the chances when Holmgren offered them. The Danish player, ranked 484, eventually sealed the set.
In the second set, it was Nagal who drew the first blood and went up 5-2. He served out the set in the ninth game to force a decider.

Nagal had a chance to get the first break when he made a deep return and Holmgren’s forehand return sailed over the baseline at 30-all but the home player served well to save the chance.
Nagal got another chance when Holmgren netted a forehand at deuce point in the third game but he himself made a forehand error on the breakpoint.
While Nagal preferred to hit from the baseline, Holmgren often charged the net often to create chances for volley winners.
Holmgren handed Nagal another break chance when he tried to pick a low volley but could not keep the ball in the court and followed that up with a double fault, allowing the Indian to take a mini 3-2 lead.

That lead stayed with Nagal and he came out serving for the match in the 10th game. Holmgren’s forehand error gave the Indian three match points and converted the first one on home team player’s unforced error.
In the opening singles, 19-year-old Rune broke Bhambri twice in each set. Rune converted four of the seven break chances while the Indian did not get a single chance to break his opponent.
Rune played percentage tennis while Yuki struggled with his first serve, double faulting four times in the lop-sided contest being played at indoor hard courts. Yuki has quit singles on the ATP Tour.

Carey reminds Australia of Indian pacers’ reverse-swing threat,"Australia abandoned the idea of ""irrelevant"" tour games in India and instead trained with SG balls on specially-prepared spinning pitches in Sydney before coming to India.","Australia wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey has reminded his team how damaging the Indian pacers could be with their reverse swing even as countering the threat from hosts spinners was the main focus in the build-up to their high profile four-match Test series starting on Thursday.
Australia abandoned the idea of “irrelevant” tour games in India and instead trained with SG balls on specially-prepared spinning pitches in Sydney before coming to India.
“Going to Pakistan it was a lot of spin talk and I found the reverse swinging ball difficult,” Carey told reporters here on the sidelines of their four-day training camp.
He recalled their tour game in Bengaluru in 2018 when pacers were equally making impact as the spinners and Mohammed Siraj returned with a match haul of 11 wickets.
“I played a four-day game (for Australia A against India A) in 2018 and a lot of the talk was about spin and probably forget a bit how damaging both team’s fast bowlers are with the reverse-swinging ball, with a wicket that might be a bit up and down,” said the 31-year-old.
Carey also recalled their drawn Test series in Sri Lanka in July last year where the Australians had to adapt to different pitch conditions.
“We went to Galle for two Tests and they were two different wickets. So be open-minded about what we are going to come up against, what team they put on the park and what scenario I come in at,” he said.
“Having the game ebb and flow between spin and fast bowling, dry periods, periods where it will score quickly…think that’s great about this team, the experience we do have.” Carey said the visiting team understands the capability of the Indian side, and will plan accordingly.

“We’ll speak to the guys who have played (in India) in the past and we’ll have our batters’ meeting soon. We’ll face a lot of different spinners throughout the next few days, our spinners (are) bowling well as well, so for everyone it’s getting our feet on the ground.
“We haven’t really spoken about the way we are going to play, it’s the individual basis. For Travis it might be exploring that (attacking) game a bit, Renners (Matthew Renshaw) is a bit taller and can get to the pitch of the ball — he has been here and succeeded — so it’s up to the individual to own their game then we back them in to do that.” Known for his attacking instinct against the spinners, Carey said: “I like to sweep in most circumstances, most formats, then (it’s) playing the conditions.
“It’s an exciting Test tour, there will be chaos at times, wickets will fall at times, just try to manage those situations. When we are on top hopefully the batters can really go big,” said Carey who has not played Test cricket in India.
Since their defeat against England in 2012, India are on an enviable record streak of winning 15 consecutive Test series at home. No other team has won more than 10 home series in a row.

With a healthy lead at the top of the standings, the No. 1 ranked Australian team has one foot in the World Test Championship final. Number two India will need to produce at least a 3-0 or 3-1 win to make their successive WTC Final.

"Dipa Karmakar reacts to doping ban, says she ‘can’t wait to get back on the floor’","India’s star gymnast, who has been serving a suspension for a 21-month period after testing positive for higenamine, says she doesn’t know how the substance entered her body.","India’s star gymnast Dipa Karmakar has confirmed that she has been serving a doping suspension for a 21-month period, effective until 10 July, 2023. She had tested positive for higenamine.
Higenamine, a stimulant, is listed under Beta-2 Agonists, (of the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list). According to anti-doping literature of the US Anti-Doping Agency, higenamine acts as a general stimulant. It helps the lungs to take in more oxygen and is prohibited in and out of competition.
Reacting to a statement from International Testing Agency (ITA) regarding her ban, Karmakar put out a statement on Twitter saying: “In October 2021, my sample was obtained for out-of-competition testing and sent for assessment. The result was positive for a banned substance which I unknowingly ingested and could not determine the source of. I decided to take a provisional suspension with the hope of a swift resolution with the international federation. I am happy that the matter has been amicably resolved.”

Karmakar says she doesn’t know how the banned substance entered her body and it’s something that has caused her immense stress.
“It has been distressful to not know how the substances entered my body, however, more so to be in a position where my ethics have been questioned. Never in my career has the thought of consuming a banned substance crossed my mind. Gymnastics is all I have, and I would never do anything which would bring myself or my country into disrepute,” she said.
Karmakar first came to prominence at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, where her high-scoring Produnova vault earned her a bronze. She subsequently finished 4th at the Rio Olympics, and went on to win a World Cup medal thereafter.

The Tripura gymnast had undergone knee surgery and had been in rehab for the most part since 2018. She has not competed in the intervening period since the stated date of testing as per ITA.

They host Crystal Palace later on Saturday.","Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag declined to comment on Mason Greenwood on Friday, 24 hours after criminal charges against the 21-year-old forward were dropped.
“I can’t add anything. I refer to the statement of the club,” Ten Hag said at a press conference on Friday.
“In this moment, I can’t give comment about the process. I can’t say anything about it, I refer to the statement of the club and at this moment I can’t add anything.”
“We have always to focus on the game, no matter what, it is our job,” he said. “That is why we are here.
“We have a lot to do against them. Two weeks ago it was a bad performance there, I wasn’t happy with the performance from us, it was 90 percent focus and energy and we dropped two points.
“Tomorrow we need a better game, better focus in the game, better conduct in the way of play because we have to beat them, that’s quite clear.”
Ten Hag happy with squad depth
Manchester United made fewer signings in the January transfer window compared to other top teams in the Premier League but Ten Hag said he is confident the Old Trafford club have depth in their squad.

“We have formed and constructed a squad, we invest also in the summer. From that point on, it is about developing the team and it has to come on the training ground, it has to come in the matches, that we develop the team,” Ten Hag told reporters.
“That is the advantage of having so many matches, that you can work on that and you don’t have to wait so long (for the next one)… There is a limit to every player but we have depth in our squad.
“Maybe not as far as other teams, but that has something to do with your approach to it and how you do your load management. If you do that right, I think you can go far.”

Pardon the leap of faith but Shubman Gill reminds one of a young Roger Federer,"Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma need to prefer in-form Shubman Gill over KL Rahul for the Gavaskar-Border Trophy. If they are in any doubt, they need to remember what West Zone selector Naren Tamhane said when the selection committee faced a dilemma over the 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar. ""Gentlemen, Sachin never fails,"" he had said.","In February of 2001, a few old hands reported from Basel, Switzerland that they had seen the future of tennis. They weren’t wrong. This February, there were many at the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad who too were sure that they had seen the future of Indian cricket.
Time will decide the authenticity of these latest claims but the optimism of those who saw a young Roger Federer back then and the ones watching Shubman Gill now, isn’t too different. There’s more to this audacious comparison.
Not a hair out of place, no sweat beads on forehead, tall graceful frame, measured footwork, refined technique, silken shots – pardon the leap of faith, apologies for this wishful thinking – but Shubman, 23, the other day, brought to mind the 20-something Federer.
It was at Basel, at the start of this century and four months before he beat Pete Sampras at Wimbledon to be the globally recognised King-in-waiting, that Federer had made a first big impression on a few American tennis writers – the bunch of well-travelled hacks whose word carries weight and judgement is respected around the world.
Among those who had covered Federer’s single-handed Davis Cup demolition of Team USA was Christopher Clarey – the seasoned New York Times tennis correspondent, whose present day Twitter bio-data goes thus – 100+ Slams. 70+ countries. 15 Olympics.
At 41 years of age, Federer had gone far beyond when tennis players are expected to be relevant in the draws of big tournaments.(Reuters)
In his riveting book on Federer, titled The Master, Clarey has reproduced the more than two-decade-old match report he wrote after watching the 21-year-old Swiss star. With the delight of an early-riser who had caught the spectacular sun-rise, he wrote about Federer’s “precociously poised”, how he was “innately capable of raising his level under pressure” and his magical art that allowed him “to do just about everything fluidly.”
If by some quirk of fate, the seasoned American tennis reporter had also covered the ancient British sport and had landed in Ahmedabad for the India-New Zealand T20 game, he could easily borrow a lot of lines from his insightful 2001 ode to the young Federer while describing Shubman’s unbeaten 126 from 63 balls. Those 12 fours and 7 sixes, on a different sporting arena of smaller dimension, divided by a net, would have been aces and winners.

Maybe, having seen many false dawns in his long career, Clarey, in his laudatory piece, adds a note of caution. In hindsight, it could have been edited out. However, at this stage of Shubman’s young career, it would be wise to retain that entire paragraph. “… It is impossible to know whether he will use his manifold gifts to become a consistent world-beater. Money, adulation and injuries can dull the biggest appetites and sharpest strokes, but there can be no doubt after the last two weeks that the Swiss have another potential champion in their midst,” he wrote, referring to another World No.1 and Federer’s country woman Martina Hingis.
As of now, there is no doubt about Shubman’s voracious appetite and sharpness of his strokes. For the last one-and-a-half-month, while facing the red ball or white, wearing blues or flannels, Shubman has been unfailingly annihilating bowlers. The staggering numbers that provide evidence of permanent residency in ‘the zone’ read as follows. Tests: 1 hundred; ODIs: 2 hundreds, 1 double hundred and T20: 1 hundred. What most batsmen take a lifetime to compile, Shubman spectacularly did in about 45 days.

The uniqueness of Shubman’s batting is its ubiquitous style. He remains true to the basic tenets of his craft, regardless of the format. Such is the malleability of his original batting style that he doesn’t need to innovate or break his batting stance and get into some pilates pose. Like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli before him, Shubman doesn’t compromise his classical Test-match correctness for the sake of short-term ODI goals or IPL’s T20 commerce.
Staying inside the line of the ball, banking on good-old back-foot play, light on feet, good stride forward, subtle wrist work are the old-school virtues that form the soul of his batting. On the outside, he is a new-age, strike-rate conscious batsman with six-packs. He also has looks that sell beauty products for men and health drinks.

Since a lot has been said and written about his strokes, leaning on Federer’s tennis would make for interesting reading. Going back to the Ahmedabad game, watch his booming cover drive at the start of his innings. It was a back of length ball which he played on the up with a smooth swing of the bat that was more angular than upright on the way down. The impact of that shot was akin to the classic Federer ace down the T at the start of the first service game. Perfected by hours of repetition, this is the Indian opener’s percentage stroke to assert domination. It’s Shubman’s signature on the turf, an early sign to put the phone on silent and get comfortable on the couch.
Shubman’s leg-side play has the wristy magic of Federer’s single-handed backhand. His unique short-arm pull to mid-wicket is the same as the tennis legend’s deep dying backhand slice. The least spectacular of their shots, they happen to be ones the connoisseurs drool over. Judging the length early and a frenzied wristy maneuver being the secret of these shots.

That elegant Shubman flick to mid-wicket, delivered with that upright stance, makes cricket fans go weak in their knees. That comes close to Federer’s iconic one-handed top-spin, the freeze frame of which has donned book covers, tournament promotion hoardings and insta Grand Slam updates. Shubman gets on top of the ball to control the trajectory of the ball. The long levers of his tall frame add power to those precise strokes – the two combine beautifully to exploit the gaps between the fielders. There’s also the aerial variety that goes over the square leg.
Federer’s on-the-run backhand pass is Shubman’s dancing down the track straight lofted hit into the sightscreen. It’s a crowd favourite, it makes the eyes bulge and the simultaneous shaking of head in disbelief. It’s also what makes fans book tickets the next time the player of that glorious shot comes to their city.

Temperamentally too, the two are similar. Federer on the junior circuit was a tantrum-throwing, racket banging brat. Shubman wasn’t that bad, though there has been an episode with an umpire during a Ranji game during days he was making a transition from a promising junior to a senior team regular. This was before their present-day Zen mode.

Federer was no Boris Becker, he wasn’t an instant hit when he first burst on to the international circuit. Shubman too has been in and out of the team. The Swiss legend ironed out technical flaws on his backhand, to emerge as regular Slam winner. Shubman too seems to have worked around his previous problem of rather slow transfer of weight onto the front foot.
If Ahmedabad was Basel, will the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy be his 2001 Wimbledon moment – when Federer defeated Sampras? India might have been blown away with his aesthetically pleasing and highly entertaining batting, but it remains to be seen if he has impressed the team management enough. Will Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma prefer the recently married senior opener KL Rahul or punt on the boy with the Midas touch?
Many winters back, the national selectors had faced a similar dilemma. The committee to pick the India squad for the 1989 Pakistan tour had faced a logjam over picking the 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar. The chairman was worried, he threw up a few thoughts: What if Baby Tendulkar failed? What would it do to his psyche? That’s when the West Zone selector Naren Tamhane uttered the memorable words that changed Indian cricket forever. “Gentlemen, Sachin never fails,” he said.

Shubman needs to pad up first for the Tests against Australia. The decision-makers need to know their history. Someone needs to show Tamhane-kind of conviction in the youth. Remember, when in doubt, India has historically thrown its weight behind their batting prodigies.

How a farmer’s son from a village in Junagadh helped Steve Smith prepare for Ravichandran Ashwin,Mahesh Pithiya was flown into Alur to help Australian batsmen 'face Ashwin' during practice; he bowled the most to Steve Smith and even 'dismissed' the batting great.,"Mahesh Pithiya watched his first cricket match in a paan shop in Nagichana, a village which is an hour away from Junagadh, a cricketing backwater. It was Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell Test at the Wankhede Stadium back in 2013.
During this ‘public screening’ of the Test match in the village, Pithiya noticed that his bowling action was similar to off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. The similarity was a coincidence, Pithiya said because before that day he had never seen Ashwin bowl. Back then he was a village-level tennis-ball off-spinner. He stuck to his natural action and nearly a decade later it helped him get a big break — bowling to one of the greatest batsmen of this era, Steve Smith.
The likeness had caught the attention of the touring Australian Test team keen to replicate a Test match in India feel during practice ahead of the four-Test series that starts on February 9. Pithiya, from a farming family, boarded a flight to Bangalore on Wednesday.
“Steve Smith was the batsman I bowled to the most over the past two days. The Australian batsmen only realised I am similar to Ashwin when I started bowling to them during practice. Smith was very keen on facing me,” Pithiya says about the visiting team’s practice sessions in Alur. Pithiya, still in awe of the quality of batsmen he bowled to, says he ‘dismissed’ Smith on a few occasions.
Pithiya, 21, made his First-Class debut for Baroda in a Ranji Trophy game against Uttar Pradesh in December. He wasn’t in the limelight or on the radar of the Australian team but a throw-down specialist from Baroda forwarded a video of his bowling to Australia’s assistant coach Andre Borovec. “I was asked if I knew any good spinners and I forward the video of Mahesh. The similarity of his action with Ashwin is there but he is also a very good spinner,” Pritesh Joshi, the throw-down specialist, said.

  A post shared by Mahesh Pithiya (@themaheshpithiya99_)
The sudden spotlight, which followed a write-up by Cricbuzz about the ‘Ashwin impersonator’, has given Pithiya his first brush with fame. He says he has given half a dozen interviews, including to the official broadcaster of the four-Test series. Cricket Australia’s official website had a write about the Ashwin duplicate.
Till Friday evening, the second day of practice in Alur, Pithiya could not find time to have a conversation with his folks back home — his father Viran, mother Maniben and brother Dinesh.

Pithiya said he is pinching himself after getting the opportunity to stay in the same team hotel as the Australians, travel in their team bus and bowl to Test batsmen from the No.1 team in the world.

“Junagadh is not known to produce cricketers, so it goes without saying that avenues hardly exist for a young player who wants to make it big. There is a lot of tennis ball cricket,” Pithiya said.

He followed in the footsteps of his tennis-cricket-crazy brother Dinesh. The boys played in the village but were looking for an opportunity to upgrade their skills. Pithiya heard about two boys from a nearby village who had made it to a cricket hostel in Porbandar. His brother encouraged him to go for trials — first in Junagadh and then Porbandar.
The Porbandar stint lasted just about six months and Pithiya felt he wasn’t progressing. “A coach called NK Sharma had come to the hostel on deputation. He advised me to move to Baroda. Good, I listened to him. I played for Baroda’s Under-19 team and also represented them in Ranji Trophy this year,” Pithiya said.
The Australians have started calling him ‘Ashwin’ but they are not the first because the similarity in delivery stride and the lead-up had been noticed by other teams in the past. The carrom ball is still a work in progress, Pithiya said. “I have an arm ball and a backspin delivery. I am working on a few variations,” Pithiya added.

Pithiya is scheduled to fly back home on Sunday by which time the Australians will be packing their bags and heading to Nagpur, the venue for the first Test match. “Being asked to bowl against the Australians was an unexpected opportunity. I will gain from it but I know I have a long way to go in my cricket career,” Pithiya said.
When he is home, even after he moved to Baroda to play cricket, Pithiya helps his parents by chipping in on the farm. “Groundnuts and wheat are what we grow. I work on the farm even now.

Olympic flame to take seaborne journey to 2024 Paris Games,Friday’s announcement came as the general assembly of Ukraine’s National Olympic Committee met in Kyiv to discuss a possible boycott of Paris 2024 if Russian athletes are allowed to compete.,"The Olympic flame is going for a sail. Instead of arriving overland, the symbolic flame alighting the 2024 Paris Games will take to the seas from its birthplace in Greece, arriving aboard a three-mast tall ship in the French port of Marseille.
Paris organizers announced the flame’s journey on Friday at City Hall in Marseille, a former Greek colony founded 2,600 years ago. According to tradition, the flame will be lit by the sun’s rays at a ceremony in Ancient Olympia. Then it will be carried by the Olympic torch to Athens and across the Mediterranean to the famed Old Port of Marseille, where the flame will be greeted by an armada of boats along the French coastline, organizers said.
It will travel to the Marseille marina — where Olympic sailing competitions will be based — and the Marseille stadium hosting Olympic soccer games.
After that it will be carried overland in the traditional torch relay, before arriving in Paris to light the cauldron and officially open the 2024 Games, which run from July 26-Aug. 11. The Paris Paralympics follow from Aug. 28-Sept. 8.

Friday’s announcement came as the general assembly of Ukraine’s National Olympic Committee met in Kyiv to discuss a possible boycott of Paris 2024 if Russian athletes are allowed to compete.
The International Olympic Committee last week sought to chart a path for athletes from Russia and Belarus who have not actively supported the war in Ukraine to join the Paris Olympics. That provoked strong objections from Ukraine, which wants those countries banned from most international sports.
Asked by the Associated Press about the issue, Paris 2024 organizing committee president Tony Estanguet declined to delve into what he said was a political decision.

In the first half, Al Fateh had taken lead through Cristian Tello in the 12th minute. A lead that stood for 30 minutes as Talisca levelled with three minutes plus added time left in half time. Sofiane Bendebka scored a second for Al Fateh 13 minutes into the second half. 
Ronaldo, who had completed a move to the Saudi club after parting ways with Manchester United during the 2022 World Cup, had been scrutinized last week as Al Nassr lost 3-1 to Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Super Cup semifinal.

"WATCH: Cristiano Ronaldo misses open goal against Al Fateh, skies the shot over","In a game that saw Al Nassr lose 2-1 to Al Fateh, Ronaldo failed to roll in the ball into an empty net from inside the box.","For majority of his career, Cristiano Ronaldo earned his name by scoring goals from obscure angles and being an absolute goal poacher. However, the 37-year-old Portuguese has found it tough to live up to his reputation of late.
Since his arrival at Al Nassr, Ronaldo has scored only twice, that too for Saudi All Star against Paris Saint Germain in an exhibition game. A game PSG won 4-5. Since then, Al Nassr have lost the Saudi Super Cup semifinal against Al-Ittihad, a defeat after which the star forward came under scrutiny.

Later in the game, Ronaldo converted from the spot to equalise in the stoppage time of the second half as Al Nassr shared a point with the home team.

If sources in the BCCI are to be believed, there is little to no chance of the Asia Cup being held in Pakistan in September.

“Jay is in Bahrain for the ACC meeting. The BCCI’s stand will not change. We will not be travelling to Pakistan as we haven’t got any go-ahead from the government,” a BCCI source stated.
It is also understood that recent bomb blasts in Peshawar has again raised security concerns about holding cricket tournaments in Pakistan.
In December last year, ACC chairman Shah had released the itinerary of the continental body and the venue of Asia Cup wasn’t mentioned.
This led to Sethi accusing Shah of taking “unilateral decision”, an allegation that ACC officially refuted stating that repeated emails to PCB seeking recommendations on the itinerary went unanswered.

Ukraine steps up efforts to exclude Russia from Olympics,A meeting of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee did not commit to a boycott but approved plans to consult with and persuade sports officials around the world over the next two months.,"Ukraine stepped up efforts Friday to lobby international sports leaders against Russian participation in next year’s Paris Olympics as indications mount that the games could see the biggest boycott since the Cold War.
A meeting of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee did not commit to a boycott but approved plans to consult with and persuade sports officials around the world over the next two months.
The committee members voted for “consultations on preventing the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in all international competitions and a possible boycott.” The International Olympic Committee is pushing to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at the 2024 Paris Games. They would take part without their national flags or anthems as “neutral athletes.” The IOC, which previously recommended excluding Russians and Belarusians from world sports on safety grounds, argues that it cannot discriminate against them purely based on citizenship, citing comments from United Nations officials.
Ukraine wants Russia and Belarus to be banned from the Olympics entirely. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said any neutral flag would be “stained with blood.” Also Friday, the prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania urged the IOC to ban Russian athletes and said a boycott was a possibility.
Ukraine boycotted some sporting events last year rather than compete against Russians.
Speakers at the Ukrainian Olympic Committee’s assembly meeting Friday raised concerns about Russia using the event in Paris for propaganda and noted the close ties between some competitors and the country’s military.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that if athletes from the two countries compete, “it should be absolutely clear that they are not representing the Russian or Belarusian states.” The United States will host the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

If the IOC’s proposal takes effect, Paris would be the fourth Olympics in a row where Russian athletes have competed without the national flag or anthem. The Russian teams at the Winter Olympics in 2018 and 2022 and the Summer Olympics in 2021 were all caught up in the fallout from a years-long series of doping cases.

Can’t take new year’s Test from Sydney to Adelaide: Clarke,"Just like the Boxing Day Test is synonymous with the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) has historically been hosting the first fixture of the new year.","Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has ridiculed a reported proposal by South Australia to bring the new year’s Test to the Adelaide Oval from Sydney, saying it is unthinkable.
Just like the Boxing Day Test is synonymous with the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) has historically been hosting the first fixture of the new year.
However, the inclement Sydney weather around this time of the year has caused a lot of frustration, with the latest disruption coming during the third Test against South Africa.
Substantial disruption was witnessed on the first and second day of the Test, while the entire third day was rained off as the match ended in a tame draw.
It is estimated that inclement weather affected Test cricket 64 per cent of the time in the last eight years in the Sydney.
A report in news.com.au said on Friday that South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas has confirmed that Adelaide had approached Cricket Australia (CA) for the new year’s Test to be moved from SCG to Adelaide Oval.
“I think we had double the crowd at the Adelaide Test than we saw at the Perth Test. We often have bigger crowds than Sydney and that’s despite having a far smaller population,” Malinauskas was quoted as saying in the report.

“South Australians are passionate about their sport. They love their cricket, myself included, so we stand ready to work with Cricket Australia to improve their product to more people around the country.” However, Clarke, who hails from New South Wales, indicated it was wishful thinking.
“Not happening,” Clarke said on Big Sports Breakfast on Friday.
“Can’t take Boxing Day from the MCG and you can’t take new year’s away from the SCG, (an) absolute no-brainer. The day that stops is the day Test cricket is finished in this country.

Ten Hag planning to hand Sabitzer Man United debut,"The midfielder, who joined from Bayern Munich until the end of the season, became a late target for United after Christian Eriksen was ruled out because of an ankle injury that could sideline him until early May.","Manchester United’s deadline day loan singing Marcel Sabitzer is ready to play and could be handed his debut against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday, coach Erik ten Hag said.
The midfielder, who joined from Bayern Munich until the end of the season, became a late target for United after Christian Eriksen was ruled out because of an ankle injury that could sideline him until early May.
“He did only one session but you can see he’s a very fit player and I didn’t have different expectations coming from Bayern Munich,” Ten Hag told a news conference. “I think he is ready to play.
“I think he’s a really smart player and I think we gave him some guidance but he knows what to do, he knows the job.”
With United’s fine recent form propelling them back up the league table and into the top four, Ten Hag was handed a further boost this week when French defender Raphael Varane, who has suffered several injury setbacks during his time in England, announced his retirement from international football aged 29.
“For United, I think it’s good news,” Ten Hag said. “With his nation it is incredible what he achieved, big respect and I am happy he puts all his energy and experience into this team.
“He gave me the information that he was intending to do this. I didn’t discuss it with him, Rapha is experienced, at an age he makes his own decision about that, I can only express my deep respect for his career until now but there is a lot to come.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ten Hag did not comment on the news that all criminal charges against striker Mason Greenwood were dropped by police and prosecutors on Thursday.
Greenwood, who was suspended by United in January 2022 when accusations against him surfaced on social media, was charged with attempted rape, controlling behaviour and assault last October. He had been due to stand trial on Nov. 27, 2023.

"Aussie legend Rachel Haynes appointed head coach of Adani owned WPL team, Nooshin Al Khadeer also roped in","The Adani Sportsline-owned Gujarat Giants, bought for a whopping Rs 1289 crore, has already roped in former India captain Mithali Raj as their mentor and advisor.","Multiple-time World Cup winner Australian opener Rachel Haynes has been appointed head coach of the Gautam Adani-owned Women’s Premier League (WPL) team Gujarat Giants while Nooshin Al Khadeer, who guided India to U-19 team to World Cup triumph, will be bowling coach.
The Adani Sportsline-owned Gujarat Giants, bought for a whopping Rs 1289 crore, has already roped in former India captain Mithali Raj as their mentor and advisor.
Former senior women’s team coach Tushar Arothe will be the team’s batting coach and Gavan Twining will look after fielding department.
“Not only have they carved a niche for themselves in their roles, but their stories of resilience will be an inspiration for the team,” said Mithali.
“Their combined strengths will enable Gujarat Giants to give their best performance on the ground at the inaugural edition of the Women’s Premier League, which will inspire several aspiring women athletes.” Haynes, who has played at the highest level for more than a decade, has won six world championship titles with the Australian team and was the vice-captain of the side from 2017-2022.
The left-handed batter, who was an integral part of the very successful national set-up, is a veteran of 84 T20Is and played crucial roles in the Australian team’s title winning campaigns at the 2018 and 2020 T20 World Cups.
Haynes, who was part of the team that won the 2022 Women’s Cricket World Cup in New Zealand, has also turned out for the Sydney Thunder in the Women’s Big Bash League, often leading the run scoring charts for her side.
“The Women’s Premier League is such an exciting addition to the cricket landscape. The opportunity to be involved in the inaugural season with the Adani Sportline owned Gujarat Giants and work with the brilliant Mithali Raj is something I’m really looking forward to,” said Haynes.

You are my new hero: Gavaskar tells Lakshya Sen,"The 73-year-old Gavaskar, a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning cricket team, paid a visit to the academy during a regular trip to the city on Thursday.","A star-struck Lakshya Sen couldn’t believe his eyes when the legendary Sunil Gavaskar dropped in at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) in Bengaluru to meet him and the youngsters.
The 73-year-old Gavaskar, a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning cricket team, paid a visit to the academy during a regular trip to the city on Thursday.
“He had a meeting in Bengaluru and decided to meet the young aspiring kids of the academy. Badminton and cricket are two of his favourite sports. He was here with us for about an hour,” Vimal Kumar, co-founder, director and chief coach of the PPBA, told PTI.
Gavaskar later posted a picture with Lakshya Sen on Instagram and captioned it: “My new badminton hero Lakshya Sen, after the one and only Prakash Padukone.” The legendary cricketer had hailed Padukone several times while doing cricket commentary over the years, saying he is one of India’s greatest sportspersons.
Sen, who has been one of India’s most prolific sportspersons in 2022, said he was too star stuck to react.
“It feels good to hear such things from such big personalities. Honestly, I was too star stuck to react,” Sen told PTI.
The 21-year-old from Almora won gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and the India Open Super 500. He was also a member of the historic Thomas Cup win. He also won silver at the All England Championships and is also the winner of the 2021 World Championships bronze medal.

“Gavaskar sir spoke about the Thomas Cup win. I have heard so much about him from my parents and all the seniors. Also when I watched the movie ’83’, I got to know what went behind that epic win,” he said.
“I can relate to it now, essentially after the Thomas Cup win because back then they were the underdogs and in Thomas Cup, it was us.” India had claimed their first-ever Thomas Cup, beating Indonesia 3-0 in the final at Bangkok in May last year.
Asked what did Gavaskar discuss with the budding shuttlers, Vimal said, “He also gave some tips to the youngsters, asking them to analyse what went right in a day to get the best out of training.
“Gavaskar and Prakash are two self-taught heroes of Indian sport, so coming from him means a lot.” Gavaskar’s love for badminton is well-known. He was the co-owner of Mumbai Masters, a franchise which made the last-four of the inaugural Indian Badminton League (IBL).

Arsenal’s Partey an injury doubt as Arteta relies on Jorginho’s ‘leadership’,Partey came off at halftime during Arsenal's FA Cup loss at Manchester City last week and Arteta had said at the time that he needed to undergo MRI scans after the Ghanaian revealed he could not continue.,"Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey is still an injury doubt after feeling discomfort in his ribs in his last game but has not been ruled out of action yet, manager Mikel Arteta said on Friday.
Partey came off at halftime during Arsenal’s FA Cup loss at Manchester City last week and Arteta had said at the time that he needed to undergo MRI scans after the Ghanaian revealed he could not continue.
“Let’s see, that one is still a doubt Let’s see how he comes in today and if he’s able to train or not. We will make a decision on that,” Arteta told reporters ahead of Saturday’s Premier League trip to Everton.
“He’s not ruled out and it’s nothing very significant but it was significant enough to get him out of the game, which for Thomas is a bit unusual but hopefully he’ll be fine.”
With Mohamed Elneny also ruled out – potentially for the rest of the season – after undergoing knee surgery, Arsenal were forced to act in the transfer market and signed Jorginho from London rivals Chelsea on deadline day.
“We knew that in this market you have to adapt and be flexible and ready for inconvenience,” Arteta said.
“We had a big one with Mo’s injury and we needed a player in that position. It’s a player that I’ve always admired.

“His intelligence, his personality and leadership skill, he understands our way of playing. He fits really well with what I want to do. You have to adapt to the circumstances you have and now we have improved the squad.”
Arsenal have not won away at Goodison Park since 2017 and Arteta said he expects a tough test after Everton appointed Sean Dyche as their new manager.
“We have the experience in the last few years, how tough it’s been and we didn’t get the result we wanted. When it’s a new manager the environment will change, a lot of things change,” Arteta said.
“We haven’t won there the past few years, so that’s the test tomorrow.”

Gabriel Martinelli’s long-term contract extension was also announced on Friday and Arteta said it was part of a concerted effort to tie down the young players who have impressed in the title run, including Bukayo Saka and William Saliba.
“Part of the plan is obviously to extend the contracts of our biggest talents and we are trying to do that. The others will be done whenever we can, if we can agree on that,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/arsenals-partey-an-injury-doubt-as-arteta-relies-on-jorginhos-leadership-8422505/,sports
Australia will miss Zampa’s ability to zip ball against India: Sriram,"Sriram said that Zampa was someone who could ""hold"" his action for long periods of time like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, something which Ashton Agar and Mitchell Swepson might find difficult in tough subcontinental conditions.","Former Australia assistant coach Sridharan Sriram is disappointed that spinner Adam Zampa is not with the touring team for the four-match Test series against India beginning on February 9.
Sriram said that Zampa was someone who could “hold” his action for long periods of time like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, something which Ashton Agar and Mitchell Swepson might find difficult in tough subcontinental conditions.
Veteran tweaker Nathan Lyon, Agar, leg-spinner Swepson and young off-spinner Todd Murphy got the nod in the 18-member Australia squad with Zampa missing out.
Sriram, who served the Australian team for six years, has seen Zampa evolve his game, and felt the 30-year-old wrist spinner’s ability to zip the ball would be hugely missed by Pat Cummins’ side during the Border-Gavaskar series.
“I would have personally loved to see Zamps bowl here (in India), because he’s got the pace, he’s got that zip off the pitch,” Sriram was quoted as saying by ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ on Friday.
“That’s something I keep an eye out for, who has got the ability to beat you off the pitch, so I think that Zamps has got that,” said Sriram who has also played eight ODIs for India between 2000 and 2004.
Sriram, also a domestic heavyweight having scored more than 9,500 first-class runs, added Zampa was extremely keen to tour India and had even called him up a couple of times.
ADVERTISEMENT
“He wanted it more than anyone, he wanted to play Test matches in India, he had called me a couple of times a couple of months ago saying ‘Sri, I’m so excited that I could be on that tour’, so he wanted it and he started to play first-class cricket for NSW. He did well, three wickets in each innings, so he’s pretty disappointed that he’s not on this tour.” Sriram said the challenges of sustaining spin at a high level for long periods will Test Australia.
“You can bowl a bit slower or a bit quicker, but you still need that zip off the pitch, and for that your action needs to be really strong. What Ashwin and Jadeja and Nathan Lyon do really well is being able to hold their action for long periods of time in conditions which are tough to bowl on, the heat or whatever,” said the 46-year-old Sriram.
He added that Agar and Swepson could find it difficult to get the same zip as Zampa for extended periods of time.
“That will be the challenge for Sweppo and Ash (Agar), to hold their action together, to get that same zip off the pitch, even on day three or four as the innings goes on, and as they’re into their 30th or 35th over, can they still be as effective as they were in their first five or 10 overs.” Sriram, however, said Australia had no such worries in the pace-bowling department, with the likes of Cummins and Josh Hazlewood being masters of their craft.

“Our quicks are very seasoned with that, Cummins or Hazlewood, they’re very good in coming back in their second or third spell and that’s what makes them the greats that they are in the modern game, whereas our spinners are not used to that. They’re not used to bowling those long spells.” He said strengthening the technical base ahead of a tough series is a key aspect along with keeping a tab on what the rival team is doing differently.
“A lot of spinners in India have a rubber band around their fingers and just keep strengthening it, so that your fingers are strong, they don’t get tired bowling long spells,” Sriram said.

Buttler frustrated but understands why players opting franchise cricket over national duty,"Alex Hales, Sam Billings and David Willey are among the players who have decided to skip the upcoming Bangladesh series in March to fulfil their franchise cricket commitments.","England white-ball skipper Jos Buttler admitted there is a bit of “frustration” at not being able to pick the best team for international assignments in the run-up to their World Cup title defence with some players choosing T20 leagues over national duty.
Alex Hales, Sam Billings and David Willey are among the players who have decided to skip the upcoming Bangladesh series in March to fulfil their franchise cricket commitments.
“Wherever people are playing, we want to pick our best available team, especially for World Cups and big ICC events, so we are open minded,” Buttler was quoted as saying by ‘ESPNcricinfo’.
“It’s quite complicated, and there are some frustrations at certain points but I completely understand people’s positions and it’s an individual decision at the end of the day.” England have so far selected 37 players across 33 ODIs since the 2019 World Cup victory.
However, Buttler said he doesn’t want to condemn the players who are opting out of England commitments as he understands their predicament as well.
“It’s quite a unique situation. It’s the time we are in. The way the games are scheduled, I can sort of understand it both ways. As an England captain, on one side you wish that everyone would see playing for England as the main thing and grab any opportunity available,” he said.
“But there are bigger things in play as well. The discrepancy between what people can earn playing for England and not playing for England is quite large, so that’s a factor that must be considered. For each individual that will be a different decision made at different times of their careers.” England suffered a 1-2 series loss to South Africa in Kimberley. Ahead of the Bangladesh tour, they have named two uncapped players — Tom Abell and Rehan Ahmed — in the squad.

The Haryana cricketer represented India in four ODIs and four T20Is over the course of his career.
Know Joginder Sharma
The 39-year-old Joginder may have played just four games for India, but made a decisive contribution to India’s ICC World Twenty20 title in 2007. In the ICC World Twenty20 final, with Pakistan needing just 13 runs off the final over and with one wicket in hand, India skipper MS Dhoni gave the ball to Joginder, much to the surprise of everyone. Misbah-ul-Haq reduced that equation to six runs off four balls with an imperious six, but Joginder held his nerve to get Misbah to go for a scoop which landed in the palms of S Sreesanth at short fine leg. The wicket made Joginder an instant hero back home. However, that was the last time he played for the Men in Blue.
While he played for Chennai Super Kings for four seasons in the Indian Premier League, he played in just 16 matches. He recently made news while manning the frontlines of the nation’s fight against COVID-19 in his job as the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) at Haryana’s Hisar district.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/world-twenty20-2007-hero-joginder-sharma-announces-retirement-from-all-forms-of-cricket-8422014/,sports
Who is the Australian offspinner Todd Murphy set to debut at Nagpur Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy? ,A chance encounter with spin coach Craig Howard at a U-16 trail changed Murphy from a medium pacer to an offspinner and sent him on his way to a surprise call-up to Australian Test team,"The bespectacled 22-year old Australian spinner Todd Murphy has said that he was “bit surprised” by his call-up to the Test squad for the India series but the offspinner, who has just played seven first-class games, could turn out to be the wildcard surprise of the tour, if people close to him are to be believed.
It was the spin coach Craig Howard, a contemporary legspinner of Shane Warne and who is now the spin coach of New Zealand women team, who first spotted Murphy at a fortunate encounter at a U-16 trial.
Before we go into the past, here is Howard’s assessment on Murphy the spinner. “He’s very well set up to bowl with a high overspun seam position, which in Australian conditions it’s imperative that you beat people in the air rather than trying to beat them off the wicket,” Howard told Cricket Australia. “The most difficult conditions (for spinners) is Australian conditions; non-abrasive conditions are the most challenging because you’ve really got to beat people in the air. And he certainly can do that, so adapting to highly abrasive conditions is a lot easier than trying to do it the other way.”
Post his selection, Murphy has been picking up tips about bowling in India from Steve Keefe, the spinner who stunned India in the Pune Test in 2017.
“He spins up at the back of the ball, which means he’s going to get a lot of drop. He’s going to get a lot of bounce and in the right condition, spin,” Keef told SMH. Murphy made his first-class debut for Victoria in April 2021 and has captured 29 wickets averaging 25.2.

Howard was at the small town of Rochester in Victoria to watch his son trial at the U-16 camp when he spotted a 16-year old Murphy bowling off spin. Impressed, Howard enquired about Murphy and was told: “He’s a batter that bowls a bit of medium pace, he’s just stuffing around”. “And I actually said, ‘he’s your best spinner’ just off the cuff a little bit,” Howard said.
Howard then watched Murphy bowl in couple of games; by then Murphy had started to bowl more offspin. His style was “a little bit awkward, his strategies were a little bit different”. Howard then had a word with Murphy’s father Jamie, who has also played cricket, and had him send the son to him for some private spin coaching lessons – “Just to try and tidy up a little bit”.

Murphy would play a full season with Sandhurst Cricket Club in Bendigo, where Howard was based, and the spin bowling technique began to be formalised. “we worked consistently all through the year on getting him technically set up and then playing with him I was able to guide him tactically as well,” Howard says.
Murphy has talked about how he never enjoyed bowling medium pace and his stint with Howard set up his career.
“I never really enjoyed bowling medium pace at training,” Murphy told Cricket.com.au.”So I kept tinkering with (off-spin) and then for me it was like ‘why not, why can’t I do it? The medium pace was never going to take me anywhere. So being open to changing and really enjoying learning about off-spin bowling and having Craig there to talk to was awesome.”
Speaking to Sportstar, ahead of the India series, Murphy picked the 2008 game at Sydney, in the infamous monkey-gate series involving Harbhajan Singh, as his favourite India-Australia game.

The average price for the Lakers-Bucks game is even more steep: $1,302 (just over Rs one lakh) which is a 175 percent jump from the start of the season.

Despite having a sore left ankle before the game started, James scored 26 points against the Indiana Pacers — which was his 34th consecutive game with at least 20 points — late on Thursday to stand just 63 points away from breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s record of 38,387 points. Abdul-Jabbar has held the record since before the 38-year-old James was born. Barring his first season as a rookie for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003-04, the 19-time All-Star has racked up a season average of at least 25 points per game in every other season of his career.

Australia gets ‘Ashwin duplicate’ to train ahead of Border-Gavaskar Trophy,"Expecting spin to play a major role in the four-Test series, the visitors have opted for tailor-made pitches and have availed the services of Pithiya to get accustomed to the action of Ashwin.","Australia have roped in Maheesh Pithiya, a 21-year-old spinner with uncanny resemblance to Ravichandran Ashwin, to train on spin-friendly tracks as part of their preparation for the upcoming Test series against India.
Off-spinner Ashwin may prove to be a major threat for Australia, who haven’t won a Test series in India since 2004.
Expecting spin to play a major role in the four-Test series, the visitors have opted for tailor-made pitches and have availed the services of Pithiya to get accustomed to the action of Ashwin.
The four-Test series begins in Nagpur on February 9.
“Of all the stops Australia have pulled out to prepare for their trip to India, the most noticeable at their Test tour’s first training session was the presence of a Ravichandran Ashwin duplicate,” a report in cricket.com.au said.
“With facing spin the major focus on Thursday, Pithiya was the standout among the local ‘netties’, bowling tirelessly and virtually without break through the day as he troubled the likes of Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head, who all had long batting sessions.” Pithiya, interestingly, didn’t see Ashwin bowl until the age of 11. Growing up in Junagadh, Gujarat he didn’t have access to TV and when he finally watched the India ace in action against the West Indies in 2013, he started idolising him.
The youngster, who made his first-class debut in December for Baroda, was flown in for the four-day training camp at the KSCA Ground in nearby Alur by Australia after seeing his footages in social media.

It was Pritesh Joshi — one of the bowlers giving throw downs to the Australian batters with the ‘side-arm’ aid — who first brought Pithiya to the attention of assistant coach Andre Borovec.
He also arranged for Mehrotra Shashank, a left-arm spinner who played first-class cricket for Hyderabad, to attend the camp.

“While no spinner in the world can perfectly mimic the challenge Ashwin will pose in this series, facing Pithiya over the coming days will at least help the Australians come to terms with the visual cues of the world’s top-ranked Test spin bowler,” the report said.
“The Aussie batters were also tested out by a self-described throwdown specialist Khaleel Shariff, who has worked with numerous Indian Premier League teams and was known to coach Andrew McDonald and Vettori from their time at Royal Challengers Bangalore.” The other Tests will be played in New Delhi (February 17-21), Dharamsala (March 1-5) and Ahmedabad (March 9-13).",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-gets-ashwin-duplicate-to-train-ahead-of-test-series-against-india-8421787/,sports
"With improved serve and mental resolve, Aryna Sabalenka wins maiden Grand Slam title at Australian Open","The Belarusian defeated Elena Rybakina 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in an enthralling final.","There were two moments during Aryna Sabalenka’s 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over Elena Rybakina in the Australian Open final that perfectly encapsulated her journey to her maiden Grand Slam singles title.
The first came at the first point of the match. After what seemed like a nervous warmup, Sabalenka served first and immediately hit a double fault. Some in the crowd laughed nervously, and the 24-year-old had a wry smile on her face.
For a player that has so much ability from the baseline, with a power-packed game developed around clean and precise groundstrokes, Sabalenka’s weakness on serve has always been perplexing. This time last year, she had played a tuneup event in Adelaide where she hit a remarkable 21 double faults in one match.

— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 28, 2023
This year, however, she has fully reset that shot, working with a biomechanics specialist to rework her motion and toss. That helped her find much more fluency and confidence, evidenced by the ace she hit immediately after.
The second moment came in the fourth game of the second set. After being second-best for the encounter up until that point, Sabalenka finally broke serve and got a breakthrough, before immediately going on the back foot of her own. Power and talent have been associated with Sabalenka just as much as volatility and combustibility, and in the past, that was exactly the kind of high-pressure moment where the Belarusian would have crumbled.
Not this time though, as Sabalenka saved a break point with a remarkable overhead, followed it up with an ace, and never looked back.
This is your moment, @SabalenkaA 🙌#AusOpen • #AO2023 pic.twitter.com/EI91Y0NLIQ

Saturday’s encounter was a high-octane, high-quality final full of twists and turns, momentum shifts, incredible serving, and precise shotmaking, played out between two of the best players of this tournament, fittingly meeting in the summit clash.
Rybakina had cut a frustrated figure throughout the back end of last year for being overlooked despite being the reigning Wimbledon champion. The tours’ decision to strip Wimbledon of ranking points did not allow her to climb the rankings, which meant assignments on outside courts, and brutal draws, both of which she was forced to navigate this fortnight, doing so in top form, without losing a set and defeating three former Major champions.
Slow start
It was Rybakina who flew out of the blocks in the first set, serving well and putting plenty of pressure on a nervy-looking Sabalenka, whose first-serve success rate began to drop as the opening set progressed. Rybakina took advantage by placing her return with a lot of depth into Sabalenka’s court, giving her no time to comfortably perform the slightly longer serve-to-forehand grip adjustment that comes with the Western grip.

— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 28, 2023
After dropping the first, Sabalenka reset, finding clutch serves and settling into the match right from the opening moments of the second set.
ADVERTISEMENT
For the 24-year-old, managing risk was absolutely key to the turnaround. So much of the success she has found during her time on tour has been built around the easy power she enjoys from the baseline. But to be able to reach the next stage, and perform at the elite level, the ability to merely overpower opponents is not enough, especially when reckless errors become such an overwhelming part of your game.
In the final, Rybakina also raised her level towards the end of the second set to match much of Sabalenka’s sensational shotmaking, using her experience to make her move on the court. But Sabalenka showed impressive resolve, not rushing into poor decision-making by sticking to the baseline where she was comfortable, waiting for the right opportunity to attack, and decreasing her margin for error while keeping her commitment to offensive tennis intact.
Sabalenka ended the match with 51 winners out of the total 110 points she won. Her extraordinary winners-to-total points ratio has been in and around 50 per cent throughout her time in Melbourne, making it difficult for anyone to keep up with her on the other side of the net.

— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 28, 2023
By the seventh game of the deciding set, Sabalenka had found her range to impose herself on her opponent, who was surviving in the match on the back of her strong serve. Sabalenka finally found the breakthrough after taking a page from her opponent’s books, preying on second serves through deep returns and advanced court positioning.
As she stood on the baseline to serve for the match in an enthralling final, another twist was on the cards. Almost poetically, Sabalenka hit a double fault at championship point that took it to deuce, this time the nerves not allowing for a smile, as she needed to dig deep and save two break points before finally winning the tournament.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sabalenka fell to the ground and fought back the tears, and Rybakina, true to form, did not show much emotion after playing her part in giving the Australian Open the distinction of having the match of the tournament in the final.
It was ultimately, deservedly Sabalenka’s day. Her improvements in serve and work rate, as well as the balance she has been able to find by making her all-out attack playing style more sustainable, earned her a first Grand Slam title. If she can keep it up, there could be many more to come.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/sabalenka-beats-rybakina-for-australian-open-womens-title-8409686/,sports
"Santner currently best spinner in white-ball cricket, lucky to have him: Mitchell",Santner returned with miserly figures of 2/11 from his four overs to set up New Zealand's 21-run win over India in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.,"New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell believes stand-in T20 captain Mitchell Santner is currently one of the best spinners in white-ball cricket after the left-arm tweaker’s impressive outing against India in the series opener here.
Santner returned with miserly figures of 2/11 from his four overs to set up New Zealand’s 21-run win over India in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.
Santner bowled a splendid spell and kept India under check by bowling a maiden over to Suryakumar Yadav in powerplay.
“He is one of the best spinners in world cricket with the white ball at the moment,” Mitchell, who was adjudged man-of-the-match for his 30-ball unbeaten 50, said at the post-match media interaction.
He picked up the wicket of in-form Shubman Gill, who inspired India to a 3-0 sweep over the Kiwis in the preceding ODI series.
“He (Santner) keeps proving his class. It was a very special spell by him that put us in a good position to win. He has done it for a long time now, we are very lucky to have him,” Mitchell said.
Put in, New Zealand got off to a fine start with opener Devon Conway smashing 52 off 35 balls, while Finn Allen made a quickfire 35 off 23 balls as the visitors set India a challenging target of 177.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I thought the partnerships that Finn and Dev (Conway) did early and obviously Glenn (Phillips) and Dev as well allowed us to take the innings deeper and allowed us to put some pressure on India towards the end of the innings,” Mitchell said.
“It was about constantly adapting, trying to find ways to put pressure back on their bowlers.” On the spin-friendly Ranchi track, New Zealand spinners — Santner, Ish Sodhi (1/30) and Michael Bracewell (2/31) — picked up five wickets for 72 runs from 11 overs to derail India’s chase.
“It was definitely challenging at times through the middle, especially with the spinners,” Mitchell said.

"Time for Ishan, Hooda to fire as captain Pandya faces must-win situation against NZ",India were caught in a spin web on the Ranchi pitch and lost the opener by 21 runs on Friday.,"India will have to raise their game a few notches as the Hardik Pandya-led side faces a must-win situation to level the three-match T20I series against New Zealand, here on Sunday.
India were caught in a spin web on the Ranchi pitch and lost the opener by 21 runs on Friday.
The loss also highlighted India’s bowling profligacy, especially by the pace duo of Arshdeep Singh and Umran Malik.
If tearaway pacer Malik conceded 16 runs in one over, Arshdeep leaked 27 runs in the last over, which put pressure on the India batters while chasing.
That expensive over from the young left-arm quick was the turning point as he was smashed for three sixes and a boundary.
India’s batters were off to an inauspicious start with the top-three managing just 15 runs. The hosts ended up scoring 155/9, which would have been a par score to defend on the wicket, as indicated by Washington Sundar after the match.
“150 would’ve been par and we would’ve been very happy with it,” the India all-rounder said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Skipper Pandya, however, is unlikely to bring in uncapped pace bowler Mukesh Kumar for the second T20I and will probably back Arshdeep to bounce back.
Kishan, Hooda under scrutiny
While Shubman Gill, who has been in red-hot form in the ODIs, has played just four T20Is and is still learning the nuances of the shortest format, the big concern will be the two key batters — Ishan Kishan and Deepak Hooda.
Occupying the opening spot, Kishan is nowhere near the ominous form he showed while slamming a record-breaking ODI double-century against Bangladesh last December.
Since then, Ishan’s scores in the last seven innings in both ODIs and T20Is read 37, 2, 1, 5, 8 n.o., 17 and 4.
ADVERTISEMENT
If one just considers the T20Is, it’s been a while since he last scored a fifty — against South Africa on June 14, 2022.
Hooda, too, hasn’t enjoyed much success as a lower middle-order batter and averages just 17.88 in the last 13 innings, with the highest being the unbeaten 41 against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede.
His innings of 10 runs from 10 balls at No. 7 on Friday lacked impact and the rotation of strike also came under scrutiny, especially when the New Zealand spinners were bowling.
While India are unlikely to try out newcomer Jitesh Sharma in the role of wicketkeeper-batter in the middle-order on Sunday, time is certainly running out for Hooda and Kishan.
ADVERTISEMENT
Despite the loss on Friday, there was a huge positive for India in Washington Sundar, who not only bowled a tidy four overs of spin to take two wickets, but also emerged India’s topscorer with a 28-ball 50 batting at No. 6.
With No.1-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav in terrific form, India would need someone at the top of the order to raise their game and do some big hitting, given that the Ekana Stadium here has big boundaries.
The Kiwis, on the other hand, would look for another victory to secure a memorable series win in India. They will once again rely heavily on their in-form duo of Devon Conway and Daryl Mitchell.

Salah struggling as Liverpool’s front three no longer ‘well-drilled’: Jurgen Klopp,"""Of course Mo is suffering. It was a well-drilled machine the front three, everything was clear (in) what we were doing. Everybody suffers from that, that's clear,"" Klopp said.","Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah’s struggles in front of goal are down to the club no longer having the “well-drilled” front three that terrorised defences in the past, manager Juergen Klopp said.
Although Salah has scored 17 goals in all competitions at the halfway mark this season, he has scored only seven in the Premier League where he has averaged nearly 24 goals a season during his time with Liverpool.
The Egyptian forward has won three Golden Boots for most goals in a season, but has been far from his best after the summer departure of his strike partner Sadio Mane and injuries to Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz.
“Of course Mo is suffering. It was a well-drilled machine the front three, everything was clear (in) what we were doing. Everybody suffers from that, that’s clear,” Klopp told reporters.
“It is specific, offensive play that requires a lot of work and lot of information, and not always obvious information. You create a feeling about a lot of these things, about where your team mate is and where to pass the ball without looking.”

Mane moved to Bayern Munich in the close season while Jota, Firmino and Diaz have not played since the World Cup, with Liverpool falling to ninth in the standings.
Liverpool reinforced their attack with the mid-season signing of Dutch forward Cody Gakpo who is still adapting to the team, while Darwin Nunez has not been consistent, scoring just one goal in the FA Cup since the season restarted last month.

“In two or three weeks a couple more options will be available and we can mix it up. When Darwin is playing, he is obviously more high up, going in behind,” Klopp added.
“We never played with a (number) nine before. Even when Sadio played in the position he was dropping (back) in moments. That’s not Darwin’s game, he wants to have balls at his feet and he’s a real handful there.

On Raja’s successor, he further added, “Najam Sethi has experience, and it’s no concept that only cricketers should be PCB chairman.

Following his sacking from the cricket board, Raja had said that no cricketer including Akram would’ve escaped a ban for being named in the Justice Qayyum report on match-fixing if it were to him.

If I was the decision maker at the time, I would’ve banned them forever,” the former PCB chairman had said in a TV interview.
Raja’s removal as the PCB President came in the aftermath of the men’s team losing 3-0 to England in the home Test series back in December last year.
“When your tenure is of three years, and you are sidelined after a year for a political appointment, due to political interference, the cricket will suffer.

Usain Bolt fires business manager over Jamaica fraud case,"Usain Bolt's attorneys have said the athlete's account with Kingston-based Stocks and Securities Limited dwindled from nearly USD 12.8 million to some USD 12,000.","Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt told reporters Friday that he is baffled over how USD 12.7 million of his money has gone missing from a local private investment firm that authorities are investigating as part of a massive fraud that began more than a decade ago.
Bolt also said he has fired his business manager, adding that it was not an amicable split.
When asked if he was “broke,” the retired star athlete laughed.
“I’m not broke, but it’s definitely put a damper on me,” he said.
“It was for my future. Everybody knows I have three kids. I’m still looking out for my parents, and I still want to live very well.” Bolt’s attorneys have said the athlete’s account with Kingston-based Stocks and Securities Limited dwindled from nearly USD 12.8 million to some USD 12,000. They had given the company until Friday to return the money or face civil and criminal action.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether any action had been taken as of late Friday. Attorney Linton P Gordon did not return a message seeking comment.
He told the Jamaica Observer newspaper that the public should anticipate the “expected and the unexpected” in the case.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There is nothing to say at this stage, given what is happening,” he was quoted as saying.
“We have met with persons, and we are dealing with certain matters.” Earlier this week, Jamaican Finance Minister Nigel Clarke announced that the director of the Financial Services Commission was stepping down and that the Bank of Jamaica would now be in charge of regulating the island’s financial system.
He said several government agencies and elderly customers also were affected by the alleged fraud.
“It’s always a sad situation. Definitely disappointed,” Bolt said of the elderly who were affected.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Everybody’s confused. … I’m as confused as the public.” Jamaican authorities have requested help from the FBI and other unidentified international experts, adding that clients were given false statements regarding their balances as part of the alleged fraud. Officials have not yet said how many clients overall were affected and how much money in total is missing.
Earlier on Friday, Bolt spoke at a sponsored luncheon for an upcoming relay and referred to the alleged fraud.
“As you all know. I’ve been going through a tough week, a few tough weeks,” he said, adding that he would continue to do everything he can to uplift his island.
“No matter what’s going on right now, Jamaica is my country. That will never change,” he said.

In an aside with reporters, he said: “I’m just trying to focus on my family and trying not to think too much about it because it’s a difficult situation.”
Stocks and Securities Limited did not return a message seeking comment Friday. The company contacted authorities earlier this month to alert them that a manager had apparently committed fraud.
Earlier this week, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced that his administration would not bail out the company.
“The government will not socialize any debt, and we will not socialise the failure of our banks,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/usain-bolt-fires-business-manager-over-jamaica-fraud-case-8409145/,sports

‘No one is really there to watch you bat or bowl’: Jimmy Neesham on MS Dhoni’s fandom post retirement,"Present in the stands during the 1st India-New Zealand T20I in his hometown, the former India captain received a rousing applause from the crowd. ","“Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!”
The chants reverberated around the JSCA Stadium in Ranchi during the first India vs New Zealand T20I on Friday. He wasn’t playing, of course. It has been almost four years now since MS Dhoni featured for the Indian team. His last appearance coincidentally came against New Zealand at the 2019 World Cup semifinal.
But with less than 10 months left in the next ODI World Cup, the former India captain would be the star crowd attraction during the T20I in his hometown. Present in the stands to watch the game, Dhoni received a grand applause from the crowd.
New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham, who recently turned down New Zealand Cricket’s central contract over his franchise commitments, said it meant the players who actually featured in games flew ‘under the radar’.

“It’s a great feeling actually. You sort of feel, you can fly under the radar,” Neesham told Star Sports. “No one is really there to watch you bat or bowl. Everyone is there to watch someone else. I always quite enjoyed it to be honest, coming to India knowing that the pressure will be on someone else.”
Coming into the T20I series on the back of a 3-0 defeat in the ODIs, the Black Caps beat the hosts by 21 runs in the first T20I.
Having lost the toss and being put in to bat first, New Zealand posted 176 runs on the board at the loss of six wickets. Devon Conway (52 off 35 balls) and Daryl Mitchell (59 off 30) were the chief orchestrators with the bat for the visitors.
In response, India could only muster 155 in their quota of 20 overs. The two teams will next face off on Sunday in Lucknow.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/no-one-is-really-there-to-watch-you-bat-or-bowl-jimmy-neesham-ms-dhoni-fandom-post-retirement-8408972/,sports
Ajax fires coach Alfred Schreuder after winless streak,"Defending champion Ajax is fifth in the top flight Eredivisie, seven points behind league leader Feyenoord.","Ajax coach Alfred Schreuder has been fired after only half a season at the Dutch powerhouse following a string of seven matches without a victory for the four-time European champions.
Schreuder, who took over the team when Erik ten Hag left for Manchester United, was sacked after his team could only draw 1-1 with Volendam on Thursday night, with Ajax citing “disappointing results and lack of development within the team.”
“It’s a painful but necessary decision,” said club director Edwin van der Sar. “We had faith in Alfred to change things. It became clear to us that he could not turn the tide.”

The long-due ode to Sania Mirza’s ferocious forehand   ,"Had India tried to understand Sania's tennis, they would have understood her better, gauged her impact on Indian sports. She taught young sporty girls to be feisty, both on and off the field.","On the day Sania Mirza played her last match as a professional, a truth needs to be said. India rarely discussed her tennis.
It’s a sad commentary on a nation that aspires to be sporty but doesn’t invest much time to understand the nuance of sports. It’s also a comment on a country that does celebrate the triumph of its women athletes but ignores their skill-set. Had India tried to understand Sania’s tennis, they would have understood her better, also gauged her impact on Indian sports.

Inzaghi urges Inter to be more consistent,"A second-half goal by Empoli midfielder Tommaso Baldanzi earned them a surprise 1-0 win on Monday, ending Inter's seven-match unbeaten streak in all competitions.","Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi has called on his side to be more consistent ahead of their Serie A game at Cremonese on Saturday, after they stumbled in their last outing against mid-table Empoli.
A second-half goal by Empoli midfielder Tommaso Baldanzi earned them a surprise 1-0 win on Monday, ending Inter’s seven-match unbeaten streak in all competitions.
Inter are fourth on 37 points, level with third-placed Lazio and AS Roma in fifth, and a point behind AC Milan, who were humbled 4-0 by Lazio on Tuesday.
“Luckily, we’re straight back in action. I’m convinced that my team really want to bounce back after the match against Empoli,” Inzaghi told Inter TV on Friday.
However, Inter cannot afford to slip up if they are to bridge the gap to runaway leaders Napoli.
“More consistency is required. Right now, Napoli are way out in front, and then there are five teams with very few points separating them,” he said.
A visit to bottom-placed side Cremonese, led by new coach Davide Ballardini, gives them the perfect opportunity to bounce back.

“I had him as a coach as well and he’s always well prepared. He always gives his teams a distinct identity,” Inzaghi said.
“They progressed in the Coppa Italia away at the Maradona (against Napoli) and played brilliantly away at Bologna, too; they’re in good form.”
Inter will be without defender Milan Skriniar and midfielder Nicolo Barella, who are both suspended. Midfielder Marcelo Brozovic and goalkeeper Samir Handanovic will miss the Cremonese match through injuries.
“The fixture list is packed,” Inzaghi said, with Inter meeting Atalanta in the cup quarter-finals on Tuesday, followed by the Milan derby in Serie A next Sunday.

"Grip and turn of Ranchi wicket surprised us, says Hardik Pandya","Chasing 177, India batters couldn't negotiate the spinners as they managed 155 for 9.","India skipper Hardik Pandya said they were left “surprised” by the grip and turn the pitch offered but admitted the team paid the price for allowing New Zealand to walk away with too many runs. India suffered a 21-run loss in the opening T20I after New Zealand posted a challenging 176 for six with the last-over thrashing of Arshdeep Singh for 27 runs proving to be the game-changer.
Chasing the total, India batters couldn’t negotiate the spinners as they managed 155 for 9.
“No one thought this wicket would play like that, both teams got surprised but New Zealand played better cricket. The new ball was turning more than the old ball. The way it turned and bounced surprised us,” Pandya said during the post-match presentation.
Suryakumar Yadav (47) and Hardik Pandya (21) had conjured up hope of a successful chase when they had a little partnership going but all hopes were dashed after both departed in quick succession.
“Till me and Surya were batting, we thought we would pull it off. In hindsight, we ended up giving 25 runs more than the par.” Washington Sundar shone bright for India as he took two wickets for 22 runs and then returned to smash a 28-ball 50, albeit, in a losing cause.
“The way Washington bowled, batted and fielded, it was more like Washington against New Zealand than India against New Zealand. If he and Axar can continue the way they are, it will help the Indian cricket a lot.” New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner also said it was “a bit of a shock” for everyone the way ball spun in the second innings. “But it was a great game and it was pretty tight at the end, we saw a lot of runs in the ODI series and it was nice to see the ball spin a bit more,” he said.
The win was set up by Devon Conway (52) and Daryl Mitchell (59), who smashed commanding fifties.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I don’t think we were ever safe, 170-odd was nice with Daryl hitting a couple over and he batted extremely well, we knew we had a sniff with 180.
“It was nice to chip some wickets in the powerplay and we had troubled with that in the ODIs,” added Santner, who had 18 dot balls in his 2 for 11.
“At the toss we were going to bowl because we know chasing is so good over here and especially with the dew. That’s always the challenge (on captain using himself).
“You don’t want to be seen doing the easy overs and stuff like that. We knew it was spinning in the powerplay and it was nice to chip one out.” Mitchell, who was adjudged Player of the Match, for his sensational innings, said he trusted his skills and tried to keep it simple.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It is nice to contribute to a score which helps us win a game. I thought the way the boys bowled at the end was pretty special. It is nice to take some momentum into the rest of the T20 series,” he said.
“The guys who went in early said it was pretty difficult against spin because of the tacky nature. It was my job to build a partnership and then take the onus on myself after Conway’s departure.

Next year’s Copa America, organised by the South American confederation (CONMEBOL), will also feature six invited teams from the CONCACAF (North, Central America and Caribbean) region.
It will be the second time that South America’s most important national team tournament will be held in the U.S. after the special commemorative edition in 2016, which also featured six CONCACAF teams.
On the women’s side, CONCACAF will invite four South American national teams to the 2024 W Gold Cup, a tournament that will have its first edition this year in the U.S..

Lessons from first T20: India should think twice before preparing turning wickets this season,"After Mitchell's unbeaten 59, Kiwi spinners outbowl India's for first win of the tour in first T20I in Ranchi.","Turners are a rarity in T20 cricket. The unfamiliarity manifested in Ranchi, as spinners of both sides prospered; India’s trio of Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and part-timer Deepak Hooda conceded only 56 runs for three wickets in 10 overs; New Zealand’s threesome of Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell and Ish Sodhi gave away 72 runs in eleven overs, but shared five wickets among themselves.
It was a shootout of spinners that New Zealand emerged victorious—by 21 runs. This should rankle India even more, that they lost on a turner, their strongest suit, where they are expected to shrug off opponents with the ease of swatting a pesky fly aside. Except that, in every department, New Zealanders trumped the Indians, be it bowling spin, playing spin or chalking out a workable method to bat on the surface, or reading the nature of surface (India picked three seamers plus Hardik Pandya and benched Yuzvendra Chahal). In a sense this was a less, or perhaps a warning, that if India are to dish out turners in the season, be it during Tests, the 50-over World Cup, or T20Is, they better ensure that they utilise the conditions, soul-search whether they indeed have the requisites, the mind and skills, to successfully pass the spin trials. Lest it could horribly backfire, as it did during the group game between these two teams in Nagpur during the 2016 T20 World Cup.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/conway-mitchell-and-spinners-guide-nz-to-21-run-win-over-india-in-first-t20i-8408569/,sports

After a shaky start, Sania and Bopanna won four games in a row and gave themselves an opportunity to serve for the set, but Bopanna, who is usually reliable on that shot, could not hold, giving their opponents a way back into the tie. Stefani and Matos were able to drag the opening set into a tiebreaker despite facing a set point, which they won comfortably 7-2 after Sania netted two simple overheads.
From thereon, the Brazilian pair began to grow in confidence and knew the match would be on their racquets if they held serve. 2-1 up on Sania’s serve, they took their chances by preying on her second serves, and Matos played the point of the match to get the break exchanging blows with Sania from the back of the court before hitting a backhand down the line which Bopanna volleyed out.

While Karnataka had already secured a last-eight berth following the penultimate round of Ranji matches, Jharkhand had to wait till the last day of the seventh and final round of group matches, which concluded on Friday, to know their fate.
Luckily for Jharkhand, both results went in their favour and they will take on Bengal in the quarter-finals, while Group C toppers Karnataka will play Uttarakhand in the last-eight.
On Friday, Rajasthan needed to score an outright win against Services to enter the quarters, but suffered a huge loss.
Rajasthan, who were chasing an improbable target of 319 to win, were bundled out for 135, with Services pacer Poonam Poonia and off-spinner Pulkit Narang taking five wickets each.

Holders MP, Punjab make it to quarter-finals after drawn matches
Defending champions Madhya Pradesh and Punjab qualified for the quarter-finals of the Ranji Trophy after finishing in the top two positions in Group D following a draw in their respective matches here on Friday.
While holders MP folded for 331 to concede a first-innings lead to Tripura, Punjab didn’t get to bat as Vidarbha ended their first innings on the fourth day at 273 for six following loss of play due to bad weather.
The draw, however, wouldn’t hurt MP as they finished at the top of Group D table with 33 points from seven matches. Punjab (27) and Railways (22) ended at second and third spots respectively.

Odisha created a big upset, defeating Bengal by seven wickets on the final day of their Ranji Trophy Group A match on Friday, with pace bowler Sunil Roul wrecking the hosts’ batting lineup by taking six wickets.
Though Bengal had secured a quarter-final berth in the previous round itself, the loss on Friday at the Eden Gardens ahead of the knockout round would have dampened their spirits somewhat.
Uttarakhand became the second team behind Bengal (32 points) to move into the quarter-finals after their match against Haryana ended in a draw.

Djokovic defends ‘misused’ father over Russia flag controversy,"Djokovic's father Srdjan skipped his son's semi-final win over Tommy Paul on Friday, choosing to ""watch from home"" instead after a video emerged on social media following the Serbian's quarter-final win over Andrey Rublev on Wednesday.","Novak Djokovic defended his father after a video emerged showing him posing at the Australian Open with some fans holding Russian flags, saying he was “misused” by the individuals and that his family was against war.
Djokovic’s father Srdjan skipped his son’s semi-final win over Tommy Paul on Friday, choosing to “watch from home” instead after a video emerged on social media following the Serbian’s quarter-final win over Andrey Rublev on Wednesday.
The video caused controversy and led to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reiterating support for Ukraine and criticising supporters of Russia’s invasion.
“He (Srdjan) was passing through, made a photo, it has escalated. He was misused in this situation by this group of people,” Djokovic told reporters.
“I can’t be angry with him or upset because I can say it was not his fault. He went out to celebrate with my fans.
“After that, he felt bad and he knew how that’s going to reflect on me, the whole media pressure and everything that has happened in the last 24-48 hours.”
Djokovic said it was unfortunate the issue had escalated.
“My father, my whole family and myself have been through several wars during the 90s,” Djokovic said.

“We are against the war, we never will support any violence or any war. We know how devastating that is for the family, for people in any country that is going through the war.
“My father was passing through. There was a lot of Serbian flags around. That’s what he thought. He thought he was taking a photo with somebody from Serbia. That’s it. He moved on.”
Srdjan said earlier in an emailed statement that he was only in Melbourne to support his son.
“So there is no disruption to tonight’s semi-final for my son or for the other player, I have chosen to watch from home,” Srdjan said.

Djokovic faces Greek third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday’s final seeking a record-extending 10th title at Melbourne Park and 22nd Grand Slam to equal Rafa Nadal.
Tennis Australia declined to comment on whether Srdjan would be welcomed back for the final, but Djokovic hoped he would be in his box.
“It wasn’t pleasant not to have him,” Djokovic said. “I hope to have him.”
Earlier, asked by a reporter if Srdjan should be deported for posing with the fans, Albanese told a news conference that Australia “stands with the people of Ukraine.”
“That is Australia’s position and Australia is unequivocal in our support for the rule of international law,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We do not want to see any support given to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that is having a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine.”
FLAG CONTROVERSY
Police had questioned four fans seen with “inappropriate flags and symbols” after Djokovic’s match with Rublev.
Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete as individual athletes without national affiliation at the Australian Open, though their flags are banned from the tournament following a complaint by Ukraine’s ambassador last week.
Ukrainian player Marta Kostyuk said she was pained by the Russian flags, expressing surprise at the lapse in security that allowed fans to display them.
ADVERTISEMENT
A video on social media showed a fan on the steps of Rod Laver Arena holding up a Russian flag with the picture of President Vladimir Putin on it.
Photos also showed one fan with a “Z” on his shirt. Russian forces have used the letter as an identifying symbol on their vehicles in Ukraine following their invasion.
Some supporters of the invasion have also used the sign.
The fan was spotted again on Friday without the “Z” shirt and a Tennis Australia spokesperson said he was allowed to return after cooperating with the authorities.

Djokovic, who was deported ahead of the 2022 tournament over his COVID-19 vaccination status, said the latest controversy was not pleasant after what he dealt with last year.
“It’s not something that I want or need. I hope that people will let it be, and we can focus on tennis,” he said.
“It’s not an ideal situation or circumstances to be in when you have to deal with all these other outside factors that are not really necessary during such an important event.
“But it’s been part of my life. Unfortunately the last few years more so. I try to evolve from it. I try to become more resilient, more stronger.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/djokovic-defends-misused-father-over-russia-flag-controversy-8408367/,sports
Wahab Riaz named caretaker Sports Minister of Pakistan’s Punjab province,The 37-year-old has been retained by Peshawar Zalmi for this year's Pakistan Super League and is expected to fulfill his commitment to the team despite his appointment as the caretaker Sports Minister of the Punjab province.,"Wahab Riaz, Pakistan’s sidelined left-arm fast bowler, has been named the caretaker Sports Minister of the Punjab province, marking his entry into politics while still active on the cricket circuit.
Wahab, who is currently playing in the Bangladesh Premier League, will take oath after he returns to Pakistan.
There is no official word on what this means for his involvement with the Pakistan Super League.
The 37-year-old has been retained by Peshawar Zalmi for this year’s Pakistan Super League and is expected to fulfill his commitment to the team despite his appointment as the caretaker Sports Minister of the Punjab province.
Wahab last played for Pakistan in 2020 and has appeared in 27 Tests, 92 ODIs and 36 T20 internationals. He is the leading wicket-taker in the PSL with 103 wickets.
Wahab’s appointment was confirmed by the caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Friday and the cricketer will probably hold this position until elections of the Punjab Assembly are held in the next three to four months.
Pakistan’s Punjab state this month dissolved the local legislature on the advice of the chief minister, an ally of former premier Imran Khan, in a bid to force snap elections.

Penalty rules likely to change after Emiliano Martinez’s goalkeeping antics in World Cup: Report,"The IFAB is set to draft new regulations at the AGM in London in March before rewriting the laws which would look into the gamesmanships of the goalkeepers who sometimes ""unfairly distract"" the penalty taker through various tactics.","The International FA Board is set to bring about new changes in its penalty rules in order to stop antics like that of Argentina shot stopper Emiliano Martinez in the World Cup final against France, the Sun reported.
The IFAB is set to draft new regulations at the AGM in London in March before rewriting the laws which would look into the gamesmanships of the goalkeepers who sometimes “unfairly distract” the penalty taker through various tactics.
Martinez was the one whose antics during the penalty shootouts in the World Cup grabbed limelight due to his aggressive approach. In the final against France, he made Kingsley Coman wait for a while as he talked to the referee, asking him to check the ball placement on the penalty spot.
Martinez would also play mind games with Real Madrid’s Aurelien Tchouameni as he stepped up to take his spot kick, by walking to his goal-line with the ball and throwing it to the edge of the box.
These tactics worked and both the French players missed their kicks as Argentina ran away with a 4-2 win on penalties and won their 3rd World Cup.
Martinez has been in the eye of the storm for his gesture after collecting his Golden Glove award where he placed it in his crotch area on the podium.
Martinez’s explanation for the gesture was that he did it in response to boos from the France supporters.

However, FIFA had released a statement on the incident, saying that Argentina breached its code of conduct.
“Potential breaches of articles 11 (Offensive behaviour and violations of the principles of fair play) and 12 (Misconduct of players and officials) of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, as well as of article 44 of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Regulations,” the statement read.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/penalty-rules-likely-to-change-after-emiliano-martinezs-goalkeeping-antics-in-world-cup-report-8408157/,sports

"Suryakumar a trailblazer, will bring about global revolution in T20 cricket: Ponting","Suryakumar, 32, was recently named the ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Year after he became only the second batter in the world to score 1000-plus runs in a calendar year in the shortest format of the game.","Legendary Australian cricketer Ricky Ponting has called India middle-order batter Suryakumar Yadav a trailblazer, who could inspire a new breed of players to emulate his style of play and take T20 cricket to “another level” globally.
Suryakumar, 32, was recently named the ICC Men’s T20I Cricketer of the Year after he became only the second batter in the world to score 1000-plus runs in a calendar year in the shortest format of the game.
Surya scored two centuries and nine half-tons on way to amassing 1,164 runs in 2022, only second behind Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan who leads the charts with 1,326 runs in 2021.
“I think innovation-wise, skill-wise, I haven’t seen a better player (than Suryakumar) in the game,” Ponting told ICC on Friday.
“What it’s going to do as well, a lot of other players are going to try and do the things he’s doing and it’s going to add another level of skill to the T20 game all around the world.
“Someone said during the IPL this year (2022), there are going to be guys who are going to try and do exactly the same as what Surya’s doing, and that’s going to be great for the game,” added the Australian great.
Surya’s 1,100-plus runs last year came in 31 T20Is at an astonishing strike rate of 187.43 and an average of 46.56, which also propelled him to the top of the ICC Men’s T20I Batting Rankings.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ponting also called the India cricketer as the greatest innovator in the shortest version, comparing his style of batting with South African white-ball specialist AB de Villiers and former Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist.
“He’s probably doing it better than anyone’s ever done it right now. We talk about players that can score 360 degrees … some of the shots he’s hitting back behind the wicket-keeper and over fine leg are just remarkable.” Ponting said he noticed Surya’s innate talent a few years back in the IPL where he was making flicking the ball over deep-backward square look so easy.
The former skipper added that the batter has taken his stroke-play to another level and is playing some really audacious shots like flicking short balls for sixes over the wicket-keeper’s head.
“Five or six years ago, he started doing that (innovating) a lot in the IPL. He was very good at flicking the ball over deep-backward square and getting the ball over fine-leg,” Ponting said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Surya’s now been able to hit short balls on the way up and flick short balls over the keeper’s head and they’re going for six, not just for four.” Ponting said that initially he thought Suryakumar would never touch such heights, but his work ethics and strenuous regimen have resulted in his success.
The cricketer scored the third-most runs at the T20 World Cup — 239 — in Australia, which was only behind Virat Kohli (296) and the Dutchman Max O’Dowd (242).
He then continued the good work in the T20I series against New Zealand and Sri Lanka to climb to the second-highest T20 batting rating ever recorded — 908 points.
“I didn’t think he’d get to the level he’s got to, to be quite honest,” Ponting said.

Following the early exit of Shafali (10), who has not performed as per expectations in the tournament, Sehrawat and Soumya Tiwari (22) added 62 runs to take them to the threshold of victory.

Sehrawat and Gongadi Trisha (5) then completed the job with the former bringing up the winning runs with a four off Browning as India scored 110 for 2 in 14.2 overs.

Grand Slam Board says safeguarding Davis Cup is a priority,"The International Tennis Federation said on Jan. 12 that its partnership with former Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique's Kosmos was ending five years into a 25-year, $3 billion agreement.","All four tennis Grand Slams will make it a priority to safeguard the Davis Cup men’s team tournament, the governing body of the sport’s most prestigious events said on Friday, two weeks after the ITF’s partnership with investment group Kosmos ended.
The International Tennis Federation said on Jan. 12 that its partnership with former Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique’s Kosmos was ending five years into a 25-year, $3 billion agreement.
That deal was unveiled in 2018 amid much fanfare over promises to deliver “long-term benefits” for fans and all stakeholders of the game.
The ITF, the sport’s governing body, added that it had financial contingencies in place and would operate the 2023 Davis Cup qualifiers and finals as scheduled, with the Final 8 taking place in Malaga, Spain, in November.
“Protecting the heritage of the sport and safeguarding major teams competitions such as the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup is a priority for the global tennis community and will appropriately get the Grand Slams’ full attention,” the Grand Slam board said in a statement.
They board added that the Grand Slam tournaments were united in their support for the Davis Cup “recognising its historical significance and important role in growing engagement in our sport around the world.”
“We believe there is an opportunity to engage in further discussions with the ITF and ATP regarding the future of the Davis Cup competition with the ambition of seeing it restored to a premier event with an optimal format and place in the calendar that benefits players, fans and the sport overall.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The agreement with Kosmos had led to the revamp of the men’s team competition, which was founded in 1900.
The usual home-and-away ties played over a few weekends during the course of the year were scrapped.
That format was replaced in 2019 with just one home-and-away round of ties that was followed by 18-teams competing in one city for a week-long climax to the season.
After the 2020 edition was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 finale was held across 11 days in three cities — Madrid, Turin and Innsbruck.

Novak Djokovic’s father Srdjan said earlier on Friday he would not attend his son’s semi-final against Tommy Paul after a video emerged showing him posing at Melbourne Park with fans holding Russian flags.

Russian and Belarusian flags are banned from Melbourne Park during the Australian Open after a complaint from the Ukraine ambassador to the country last week. Belarus is a key staging ground for Russia’s war in Ukraine, which Moscow terms a “special operation”.
“It hurts a lot because there were specific rules, they were printed out outside that this is not allowed to bring flags,” Kostyuk told reporters after bowing out of the women’s doubles competition with Elena-Gabriela Ruse.
“It’s not impossible, but you’re not allowed to bring out the flags and so on. It really hurts that they were there for quite some time.
“They were there on the court, in the stands as well and I just don’t understand as well. It really hurts and I don’t understand how this can be possible.”

Stefanos Tsitsipas beats Karen Khachanov to reach 1st Australian Open final,"The No. 3-seeded Tsitsipas had been 0-3 in semifinals at Melbourne Park, but he finally went a step further to get to the second Grand Slam championship match of his career.","Stefanos Tsitsipas had a harder time strictly following all of the rules than he did outplaying his opponent in the early going, then recovered after blowing two match points late in the third set, and eventually reached the final at the Australian Open for the first time by beating Karen Khachanov 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-7 (6), 6-3 on Friday.
The No. 3-seeded Tsitsipas had been 0-3 in semifinals at Melbourne Park, but he finally went a step further to get to the second Grand Slam championship match of his career.
It looked easy for the better part of three sets against Khachanov, but Tsitsipas got broken when serving for the match at 5-4 in the third, then failed to convert either chance to end it when he went up 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Khachanov collected four consecutive points there, erasing the match points with a pair of booming forehands. Tsitsipas, though, regained his footing quickly, grabbing a 3-0 lead in the fourth.
“If you stick around, if you dedicate yourself even more and if you concentrate on these important moments,” Tsitsipas said, “it pays off quite well.”

Now Tsitsipas will face Novak Djokovic or unseeded American Tommy Paul in the men’s singles final on Sunday.
If he claims his first major trophy, Tsitsipas would also achieve another milestone: He would rise to No. 1 in the ATP rankings for the first time.
“I like that number. It’s all about you. It’s singular. It’s ‘1,’” Tsitsipas said. “These are the moments that I’ve been working hard for.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Djokovic, who would return to No. 1 if he wins the championship, has won the Australian Open nine times and owns 21 Grand Slam titles in all — only Rafael Nadal, with 22, has more among men — and carried a 26-match winning streak at Melbourne Park into Friday’s second semifinal. Until this week, Paul never had been past the fourth round in 13 previous appearances at major tournaments.
Tsitsipas’ other run to a major final came at the 2021 French Open, when he grabbed the first two sets before blowing that big lead and losing to Djokovic in five.
Earlier this week, Djokovic said about Tsitsipas: “He has never played a final, am I wrong?” Reminded by reporters about Roland Garros, Djokovic replied: “That’s right. Sorry, my bad.”
For about 2 1/2 hours at Rod Laver Arena on Friday, which began with nary a cloud and a temperature topping 80 degrees Fahrenheit (25 Celsius), the 24-year-old from Greece showed a game that was too versatile, and strokes that were too consistent from all over the court, for the 18th-seeded Khachanov, a Russian who is now 0-2 in Slam semifinals.

The biggest issue for Tsitsipas in that span, truthfully, appeared to be trying to deal with the watchful eyes of the match officials monitoring the 25-second clock and the position of his feet.\

Chair umpire Nico Helwerth’s first warning for a time violation came while Tsitsipas served for the first set at 5-3, love-15. Perhaps distracted, he double-faulted to trail love-30 and eventually got broken there.
The serve clock elapsed again at 5-all, love-15, and the second infraction resulted in an automatic fault, prompting Tsitsipas’ father — who coaches him, along with former player Mark Philippoussis — to stand up from his courtside seat. Again, Tsitsipas then double-faulted, again to fall behind love-30, but this time he managed to hold serve, and he was by far superior in the ensuing tiebreaker, able to ignore a foot-fault call that came at 3-1.
There were more foot-faults in the second set, and after one, Helwerth explained the problem: Tsitsipas’ back foot was extended too far behind him while serving from the Deuce side, putting his shoe beyond the middle line.

Tsitsipas would go on to break to 5-4, helped by a wild point in which he got back three overheads by Khachanov, eliciting roars from the many spectators waving blue-and-white Greek flags. Soon, he grabbed that set. He broke again to lead 2-1 in the third but failed to slam the door shut.
Instead, Tsitsipas — who lost in the Melbourne semifinals to Nadal in 2019, and to Daniil Medvedev in 2021 and 2022 — needed to wait 40 minutes from his initial match point to his last.
Serving in the fourth set at 5-3, 40-love, his missed a forehand volley on No. 3. “Uh, oh,” he might have been forgiven for thinking. But on the next point, chance No. 4, he hit a serve that drew a long return and was able to exhale.

FA Cup: Brighton look to end Liverpool’s Cup run,Underperforming Klopp's side travel to Amex Stadium as hungry Seagulls await Reds,"Brighton vs Liverpool (FA Cup 4th Round, Sunday 7 PM, Live on Sony Liv)
Liverpool are in for an awkward encounter with an 18-year-old Irish wonderkid, who had rejected them to join Brighton in October 2020, when the Reds travel to the Amex Stadium for the fourth round of the FA Cup.
Evan Ferguson has three goals and 2 assists in the Premier League thus far, with an assist coming in the recent 3-0 hammering of Liverpool on January 14. Since then, he has grabbed the headlines again with his late goal against Leicester City which salvaged a draw for his team.

“I went to Liverpool a few times,” he had said to The Athletic. “It’s a good club, but you see so many boys at Liverpool just fading away and there’s no chance to get in the first team. I was thinking, ‘Do I just want to play two years of Under-18s and then go to the U23s and go from there to where?’”
The 6’2” striker who scored his first goal for the Sea Gulls first team in the EFL Cup this year against Forest Green Rovers, the same competition in which he had made his debut 12 months earlier. He even made his Ireland national team debut in November. But it’s after the World Cup break that he has really burst into life in a blue and white Brighton shirt. He netted his first Premier League goal against Arsenal in just his second league appearance, becoming the youngest ever EPL goalscorer. In the next match against Everton, his goal made him the youngest scorer to net in consecutive Premier League matches since Manchester United’s Federico Macheda.

In addition to this new threat, Jurgen Klopp’s men will also have to contend with a team which has their number. In the last two matches, Brighton have struck 3 goals past Liverpool in each encounter, the latest being a 3-0 drubbing which Klopp termed as “the worst game he remembers.” Roberto De Zerbi’s side will hope for more of the same as they host the Merseysiders again on Sunday.
Brighton have lost Leandro Trossard to Arsenal in the winter transfer window but they pack enough punch in the midfield as evidenced by the comprehensive wins against Everton (4-1), Middlesbrough (5-1) and Liverpool (3-0), all the matches that the Belgian did not play in. Kaoru Mitoma, Solly March, Ferguson, and Alexis Mac Allister are all likely to start against the Reds on Sunday. Ferguson is likely to replace Danny Welbeck up front.
ADVERTISEMENT
Liverpool, meanwhile, will be praying for Virgil Van Djik to recover in time for the clash while stars such as Arthur Melo, Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino are very much still on the injury list. Their last match was a drab 0-0 draw against fellow strugglers Chelsea with the once vibrant Liverpool attack failing to really find a foothold in the match.
Against Brighton, Liverpool need to come off the blocks in quick fashion as any lethargic approach is likely to be punished. In order to do so, they need their talisman Mohamed Salah to get a grip on the game while getting enough support from new signing Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez. While a stronger looking attacking trio on paper, they really have failed to replicate the magic of Firmino, Salah and Sadio Mane from back in the day.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/brighton-look-to-end-liverpools-cup-run-8407371/,sports

Australia reiterates Ukraine support after Djokovic’s father poses with Russia fans,Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia's invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic's father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags.,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia’s invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags.
Police questioned four fans seen with “inappropriate flags and symbols” after a quarter-final match on Wednesday between Russia’s Andrey Rublev and favourite Djokovic, organisers Tennis Australia said.
“I will make this point, that Australia stands with the people of Ukraine. That is Australia’s position and Australia is unequivocal in our support for the rule of international law,” Albanese told a news conference after a reporter asked if Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, should be deported after he was seen posing for pictures with fans holding Russian flags.
“We do not want to see any support given to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that is having a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine.”
Djokovic’s father could not be reached for comment.
The Serbian player, who was at the centre of a storm of controversy over his COVID-19 vaccination status at last year’s Australian Open, has not commented on the incident and his spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A video emerged on social media showed a fan on the steps of Rod Laver Arena holding up a Russian flag with the image of President Vladimir Putin on it.
Photos also showed one fan with a large “Z” on his shirt. Russian forces have used the letter as an identifying symbol on their vehicles in Ukraine following their invasion. Some supporters of the invasion have also used the sign.

Srdjan Djokovic was seen in some posts posing with the Russian supporters.
Australian Open organisers on Thursday issued a reminder to players and their entourages about their policy on flags after the video of Djokovic’s father emerged.
Russian and Belarusian athletes are able to compete as individual athletes without national affiliation at the Australian Open, though their flags are banned from the tournament grounds after a complaint by Ukraine’s ambassador last week.
Djokovic was deported on the eve of the tournament last year for not being vaccinated against COVID-19 and received a three-year Australian travel ban.

That ban was rescinded in November, allowing him to compete this year.

"Sania Mirza, one of India’s greatest tennis players, gets fitting Grand Slam farewell","Trendsetter on court, and champion of breaking stereotypes off it, 36-year-old Sania Mirza leaves the Grand Slam stage where she belongs - in the final.","Sania Mirza fought back the tears as she spoke on the Rod Laver Arena for the last time. She was typically self-assured and understated in her achievement – reaching the final of her farewell Grand Slam at the Australian Open. “If I cry – these are happy tears, not sad ones,” she said.
It was not meant to be for her and compatriot Rohan Bopanna, who were defeated 6-7 (2), 2-6 in the summit clash in Melbourne by Brazilians Luisa Stefani and Rafael Matos. Even though she was unable to lift the trophy, the stage – one of the most iconic courts in the history of tennis – was fitting for her farewell.
This is where Sania belongs – the final stages of a Grand Slam. She is one of the most successful players at this stage in India’s history, with six titles. She won the Australian Open twice before, once in mixed doubles in 2009 alongside Mahesh Bhupathi, and then again in women’s doubles alongside Martina Hingis in 2016 – her last Major title.

Despite all the incredible highs she saw in her career on the doubles tour, it will always be the 36-year-old’s pathbreaking performances as a young woman on the singles tour that define her career.
The six-time Grand Slam doubles champion revealed after her semifinal win on Wednesday that the most special moment of her career was actually a 1-6, 4-6 defeat in the third round in Melbourne Park back in 2005, when an 18-year-old Sania came up against the sport’s greatest competitor.
“My professional career started in Melbourne… I couldn’t think of a better arena to finish my [Grand Slam] career at.”
We love you, Sania ❤️@MirzaSania • #AusOpen • #AO2023 pic.twitter.com/E0dNogh1d0
— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 27, 2023
“For me the most special memory remains playing against Serena (Williams) here when I was 18 years old, even though I lost that match, got blown off the court,” she said after her semifinal win on Wednesday.
“Honestly, that was when belief was installed there that this is where I belong and this is where I want to be. Even though Serena won the tournament that year, for me, it made me believe that as a young Indian girl, the dream that I had to play in the slams, try and win them, was something that happened that year for me in 2005.”

And 2005 would end up being a defining year for her. She went on to win her first WTA title in Hyderabad – to this date, the last ATP or WTA singles title won by an Indian. Later that year, at the US Open, the then-19-year-old would go on to script more history, becoming the first Indian woman to reach the second week of a Grand Slam, losing in the fourth round – the deepest run any Indian has made at a Major singles event since Ramesh Krishnan in 1987.
ADVERTISEMENT
For 10 years, before moving on to play only doubles, Sania remained India’s No.1 singles player, reaching a career-high ranking of World No. 27 in 2007.
Her impact would go beyond that, and the 91 weeks she spent as the World No. 1 doubles player, and the 43 doubles titles she won on tour, and the iconic, thunderous forehand that left many opponents in its wake. Before the likes of Mary Kom, PV Sindhu, and Saina Nehwal would gain worldwide recognition, Sania was the leading light for women’s sport in the 21st century.
For a young Muslim woman playing at a competitive level, in a globally televised commercial sport, Sania was forced to deal with a level of scrutiny most would not have to. The criticism she has had to field has been far-ranging. The manner of her appearance and outfits on court were relentlessly scrutinised, she was once absurdly accused for disrespecting the national flag, her patriotism was questioned due to her marriage to a Pakistani cricketer, and she was questioned about when she was going to settle down and start a family – to fit traditional gender-norms.

There was never anything traditional about the pathbreaking journey Sania already began by the time she was a teenager, and true to form, she dealt with the criticism in the bold, self-assured manner in which she has dealt with so many opponents on the court.
ADVERTISEMENT
She knew how much influence her platform gave her (Sania has 10.9 million followers on Instagram, Naomi Osaka, the world’s highest-paid female athlete, has 2.7 million). She spoke out against domestic violence, gender pay gaps, and female foeticide, and most of all, against the stereotypes Indian women have to face to make it in professional sport.
“There are parents who have come and said, ‘Oh, you know that my young girl wanted to do something out of the box and we want her to be like you’,” she told the Straits Times, proudly, before the final in Melbourne.
Sania had, beyond the odds, come back to compete on the professional tour after the birth of her son, Izhaan, who is now four years old and has joined her in Melbourne, even reaching the semifinal at Wimbledon last year.

But an injury that did not allow her to end her career on her terms delayed that, prompting her to play until the WTA 1000 event in Dubai next month, which will be her last.

‘I couldn’t think of a better arena to finish my career’: Sania Mirza in tears during her final address,"Mirza, who has won six Grand Slam doubles championships — three in mixed, including the 2009 Australian Open — will retire next month after a tournament in Dubai.","Sania Mirza, who has won six Grand Slam doubles championships — three in mixed, including the 2009 Australian Open — lost her last Grand Slam final on Friday as the Brazilian pair of Luisa Stefani and Rafael Matos beat India’s Mirza and Rohan Bopanna 7-6 (2), 6-2 to win the Australian Open mixed doubles title in Mirza’s last match at a Grand Slam tournament before she retires.
Expressing her emotions after losing the final, she said, “I’m still gonna play a couple more tournaments but my journey of my professional career started in Melbourne. It started in Melbourne in 2005 when I played Serena Williams in the third round here as an 18 year old.

Meanwhile, the Brazilian pair took a 3-0 lead in the tiebreaker and Mirza and Bopanna fought back to 3-2, but that was to be the last points the Indian duo took.

Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna lose mixed doubles final at Australian Open 2023,"The Indian pair were defeated 6-7 (2), 2-6 by the Brazilian partnership of Luisa Stefani and Rafael Matos.","In the final Grand Slam event of her career, Sania Mirza, alongside compatriot Rohan Bopanna, narrowly missed out on the title. The duo, vying for their first Major together, were defeated 6-7 (2), 2-6 by Brazilians Luisa Stefani and Rafael Matos in the final.
After a shaky start, Sania and Bopanna won four games in a row and gave themselves an opportunity to serve for the set, but Bopanna, who is usually reliable on that shot, could not hold, giving their opponents a way back into the tie. Stefani and Matos were able to drag the opening set into a tiebreaker despite facing a set point, which they won comfortably 7-2 after Sania netted two simple overheads.

From thereon, the Brazilian pair began to grow in confidence and knew the match would be on their racquets if they held serve. 2-1 up on Sania’s serve, they took their chances by preying on her second serves, and Matos played the point of the match to get the break exchanging blows with Sania from the back of the court before hitting a backhand down the line which Bopanna volleyed out. They would eventually win three of the next four games, and win the match on Sania’s next service game.

Bopanna, on the other hand, was playing a fourth Grand Slam final after winning his only title alongside Timea Babos at the 2017 French Open.

Dummy of Vinícius Júnior hanged off bridge ahead of derby,"The perpetrators used a black figure with Vinícius Júnior’s name on it, tied a rope around its neck and hanged it from an overpass in Madrid along with a banner with the words “Madrid hates Real.”","A dummy of Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior was hanged from a highway bridge early Thursday, hours before the team’s match against Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey.
The perpetrators used a black figure with Vinícius Júnior’s name on it, tied a rope around its neck and hanged it from an overpass in Madrid along with a banner with the words “Madrid hates Real.”
The banner and the figure apparently were attached to the bridge while still dark early Thursday morning.
Vinícius, who is Black, has been subjected to racist taunts more than once in Spain. The Brazil forward has complained on social media about being targeted by racists since he came to play in Europe.
The message on the banner is often used by one of Atletico Madrid’s ultra fans groups, though it denied being responsible for the display.
“These are repugnant and inadmissible acts that shame society,” Atletico said in a statement.
“Our condemnation of any act that attacks the dignity of persons or institutions is categorical and unreserved,” the club said. “The rivalry between the two clubs is the greatest, but so is respect. No individual, whatever their intentions or colors, can tarnish the coexistence between different supporters. It is everyone’s responsibility to avoid this.”

Real Madrid thanked others for the messages of support it received after the “lamentable and repugnant act of racism, xenophobia and hatred against our player Vinícius.”
“Attacks such as those suffered by our player, or those suffered by any sportsperson, have no place in a society such as ours,” Real Madrid said.
The Spanish league said it “strongly condemns acts of hatred and intimidation” made against Vinícius. It said it would ask authorities to investigate and seek convictions with “the most severe sentences” for those responsible.
“Intolerance and violence have no place in our sport,” the league said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Spanish soccer federation condemned the “intolerable act” and offered a message of support to Vinícius following the “direct threat by radical groups.”
“These types of manifestations, charged with hatred, only encourage violence and have no place in our sport. Soccer must be lived with passion, but always respecting the players, the opponent and the fans,” the federation said. “This type of vandalism is unacceptable.”

Atletico had already condemned its fans when a large group of them chanted “Vinícius, you are a monkey” before Madrid’s 2-1 win in the city derby last year at the Metropolitano Stadium. Spanish state prosecutors closed a probe into that case citing a lack of sufficient evidence to identify potential perpetrators of the hate crime.

FIFA beats former Nigeria coach’s U.S. appeal over match-fixing ban,The unsigned decision upheld a Manhattan trial judge's Oct. 2021 dismissal of Siasia's lawsuit. ,"Soccer’s world governing body FIFA prevailed in a U.S. appeals court over a former Nigeria national team coach seeking to overturn his lifetime ban, later reduced to five years, for fixing matches.
In a 3-0 decision on Thursday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Samson Siasia did not show why a trial court in New York had jurisdiction over his case.
FIFA had in 2019 imposed the lifetime ban, saying Siasia violated its code of ethics over a bribery scheme for Australian matches. The ban prevented Siasia from using his U.S. Soccer Federation coaching license.
Siasia, an Atlanta resident and former Nigeria striker, sued FIFA in August 2021, saying the evidence was “grossly insufficient” and that the ban violated his due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.
But the appeals court said Siasia did not show that FIFA was “essentially at home” in New York, or agreed to be sued there because it banned his use of what Siasia called his “New York” coaching license from its alleged New York “agent,” U.S. Soccer.
The unsigned decision upheld a Manhattan trial judge’s Oct. 2021 dismissal of Siasia’s lawsuit.
Siasia’s lawyer Nitor Egbarin said the decision might be the “end of the road” for the case, but he would discuss it with his client.
FIFA has said Siasia’s claims were meritless.

In June 2021, the Court of Arbitration for Sport shortened the ban, calling it too severe for a first offense.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/fifa-beats-former-nigeria-coach-u-s-appeal-over-match-fixing-ban-8406831/,sports
Record-chasing Kylian Mbappe has Cavani’s PSG mark in his sights,"While Cavani notched his 200 goals in 301 games, Mbappé has taken just 241 matches to reach 196.","Kylian Mbappe can close in further on Paris Saint-Germain’s all-time scoring record when his team hosts Reims on Sunday.
Mbappé’s tally of 196 goals for PSG means he is only four behind Edinson Cavani’s record for the club. Cavani is still idolized by fans, many of whom were angry at the club for letting him leave in 2020.
Mbappé has taken longer to win PSG’s supporters over, especially when relations became frosty during the on-off transfer saga with Real Madrid.
But his exploits for France at the World Cup in Qatar increased his popularity all over the country, and since returning he’s been applauded at every away ground — although that might not be the case when PSG visits bitter rival Marseille twice next month.
The World Cup’s top scorer is in clinical form heading into Saturday’s match at Parc des Princes after netting five goals in a French Cup win on Monday, albeit against an amateur side.
Mbappé’s attitude in that game stood out along with his crisp finishing. He took the match very seriously and spoke of his respect for the non-league teams afterward.
“It’s a reminder for us that we all come from amateur football and it’s important to keep this link,” he said. “Even if it’s only for one game.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Neymar has been largely anonymous for PSG since his World Cup heartbreak with Brazil, so PSG coach Christophe Galtier needs Mbappé to maintain his form.
“Kylian is among the greatest strikers, the world class strikers. He’s one of the best,” Galtier said. “He’s conditioned to score. That’s Kylian, a man of statistics and numbers. I don’t even need to encourage for him to break records.”
He is the league’s top scorer with 13 goals this season, one more than Lorient’s Terem Moffi and Lille’s Jonathan David, and it’s only a matter of time before Cavani’s record tumbles.
In far quicker time, too.
While Cavani notched his 200 goals in 301 games, Mbappé has taken just 241 matches to reach 196.
ADVERTISEMENT
While his best season’s haul of 42 goals overall is less than Cavani’s best total of 49, Mbappé is already on 25 goals in 24 games so far in this campaign.
With half of the league campaign still to play, he could realistically hit 50 if PSG goes far in the Champions League and the French Cup.
That might be tough, however, since PSG faces Bayern Munich in the round of 16 and is away to Marseille in the cup’s last 16.
A hectic schedule sees PSG playing seven games next month, including a league game at third-place Marseille that promises to be intense, and eight if it reaches the cup quarterfinals.
ADVERTISEMENT
Mid-table Reims is a hard team to beat, too, and is on an 11-match unbeaten run which includes holding PSG to a 0-0 draw at home in October.
PSG’s away form has been a concern recently, with consecutive defeats at Lens and Rennes allowing second-place Lens to close the gap to three points after 19 rounds.
So PSG needs a morale-boosting home win to get its confidence back, and help Mbappé close the gap on Cavani.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/record-chasing-kylian-mbappe-has-cavanis-psg-mark-in-his-sights-8406819/,sports

“Vinicius Jr is aware of the situation but is fully concentrated on tonight’s match,” a spokesperson for 22-year-old Vinicius told Reuters.
“He will discuss the issue tomorrow with his club and legal staff but his position is still the same as before – he expects punishment from the authorities, not official statements.”

Prosecutors in Madrid decided not press charges over racist chanting aimed at Vinicius in September after finding that they “lasted a few seconds” and did not constitute a crime.

In December, Vinicius accused LaLiga of continuing to do nothing about racist fans at matches, after videos on social media showed fans shouting abuse and throwing objects at him during a match the previous day at Valladolid.
Pele, Neymar and other leading Brazilian figures leapt to the defence of Vinicius in September 2022 after a panelist on a Spanish soccer show criticised the forward.

Total spending worldwide was $6.5 billion in transfer fees for players who moved across borders between FIFA member federations — an increase of 33.5% from 2021, according to FIFA’s annual review of the transfers it processed.
“While this figure is still below the levels of 2018 and 2019, clubs are clearly recovering,” FIFA said in a 75-page report.
The biggest deals in the report included Erling Haaland to Manchester City, Antony and Casemiro to Manchester United, Aurélien Tchouaméni to Real Madrid and Darwin Núñez to Liverpool.

Chelsea’s spending spree on Wesley Fofana, Marc Cucurella and Raheem Sterling, Tottenham signing Richarlison and Antoine Griezmann’s return to Atlético Madrid from Barcelona are also not included.
International spending included $73 million paid as a share of transfer fees to clubs which previously helped develop a player between the ages of 12 and 23.
FIFA expects hundreds of millions will be rightfully paid each year with the launch last year of its transfer clearing house in Paris to process payments and ensure clubs get what is due.

Although the majority of cross-border deals involved free agent players and no transfer fee, FIFA noted a record 950 clubs spent money on acquiring players.

IND vs NZ 1st T20I: Captain’s choice- Shubman Gill,"Gill will start despite Shaw’s return and domestic returns, Hardik asserts.","‘No’, came the swift response on the mention of Prithvi Shaw getting a start in the eleven on his return to the India squad for the three-match T20I series against New Zealand, that starts in Ranchi on Friday.
India’s T20 captain Hardik Pandya was clear about who would open for his side. Shubman Gill, in sublime, has a clear headway over Shaw, who last featured for his country 17 months ago. “Shubman (Gill) has done well. He’ll start. It isn’t even about giving him an opportunity as he has been batting well and was already in the team before,” he asserted.
Gill displayed otherworldly form with the bat as he scored 360 runs in the recently concluded ODI series against the Black Caps. A record joint-highest figure he shares with Pakistan captain Babar Azam. After nine innings so far across formats in 2023, Gill leads the run scoring tally in international cricket with 625, including a fifty, two centuries and a double hundred.

Shaw’s case
Shaw,  who captained Gill during India’s 2018 U19 World Cup triumph, has been in red-hot form across formats this domestic season for Mumbai, which paved his way back into the national side.

At IPL 2022, Shaw scored 193 Powerplay runs in the nine innings this season, at 9.57 runs an over, a rate brisker than any of his Indian counterparts. He, though, could only manage 283 runs in 10 outings.   He last played for India during the 2021 tour of Sri Lanka and has only made one T20I outing for the men in blue despite his reputation as a quickfire run scorer.
With senior players including Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul hinted to have been out of the T20 schemes and Ruturaj Gaikwad ruled out of the series owing to a wrist injury, Shaw may yet get to feature in the format.

Even though southpaw Ishan Kishan starts the series as a first-choice opener alongside Gill, Hardik indicated that he does not buy too much into the left-right combination theory. “It doesn’t matter whether it is left-right or right-right,” he said. “The best players will get to play no matter if they are left or right handed.”

"Russia’s path to 2024 Olympics takes shape, Ukraine objects",Ukraine boycotted an Olympic qualifier in judo last year when Russians were allowed to compete as neutrals.,"Russia’s path to sending a team to the Paris Olympics next year became clearer on Thursday amid fierce objections from Ukraine.
The International Olympic Committee indicated on Wednesday it favors officially neutral teams from Russia and its ally Belarus at the 2024 Olympics despite a plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to exclude them entirely. A day later, Russia and Belarus were invited to compete at the Asian Games, a key Olympic qualifier. Russia typically competes as part of Europe but has a tense relationship with many of the countries set to host qualifying events there. Russia and Belarus have been barred from almost all international competitions in Olympic sports following the invasion of Ukraine.
Zelenskyy has said he told French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is hosting the Olympics, that Russia should have “no place” there. Ukraine is seeking to rally support against the IOC-brokered plan.“IOC has been disregarding Russian war crimes, claiming that ‘No athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport’, while Ukrainian athletes continue to be killed by Russia because of their passports. I urge all sports figures to make their stance known,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter on Thursday.
Ukraine boycotted an Olympic qualifier in judo last year when Russians were allowed to compete as neutrals. In Russia, there was praise from the IOC plan from Igor Levitin, an aide to President Vladimir Putin who holds influential government and sports posts.
“I think it is already a success. Olympic society understands that the Olympic Games cannot be staged without Russia,” said Levitin, who is the senior vice-president of the Russian Olympic Committee, in comments reported by state news agency Tass. Some Russian officials expressed unhappiness at the IOC declaring it would not allow athletes found to be “actively supporting the war in Ukraine.” Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov said on Wednesday he opposed “any restrictions, extra requirements or sanctions.”
The IOC statement on Wednesday referenced the civil war in the former Yugoslavia at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The country was under United Nations sanctions so Yugoslav athletes were allowed to compete individually only as “Independent Olympic Participants.” They didn’t take part in team sports such as soccer and basketball.

That would be stricter than previous IOC measures against Russia in the years-long fallout from one of the largest doping cases in sports history. Russians competed under the name “Olympic Athlete from Russia” at the 2018 Winter Olympics and as ROC — short for Russian Olympic Committee — in 2021 and 2022, without their country’s anthem or flag but with national colors on uniforms. The Asian Games will be in Hangzhou, China, in September and October, and function as Olympic qualifiers in several sports including archery and boxing. Some other sports host their own Asia-specific qualifying competitions.

The 33-year-old Belarusian twice champion has worn shirts showing support for French soccer champions PSG at the tournament and as a gesture to her six-year-old son Leo, who is also a big fan of the Paris club.
After an exchange of words with the chair umpire at Rod Laver Arena, Azarenka took off the PSG shirt before warming up in her regular kit against Rybakina.
“They told me to take it off twice because I had a different shirt,” the 22nd seed told reporters after losing 7-6(4) 6-3 to Kazakh Rybakina.
“I think it’s the issue with the sponsorships. I guess the logos are too big … I know that I’m not allowed to play in that. I knew those type of things.

“But I can still step on the court in what I want to step on the court. I do it for my own reasons.
“My son wore the white jersey today to his practice, and I tried to wear a white jersey to my match but couldn’t. So that’s okay.”
That was the lesser of two disappointments for the Belarusian on Thursday, as Azarenka’s bid for a third title at Melbourne Park ended with some regret at her missed chances against 22nd seed Rybakina.
The 2012 and 2013 champion gave up a break in the first set and converted only three out of eight break points in the match.

Up 0-40 on Rybakina’s serve at 5-5 in the first set, Azarenka could not make the Kazakh pay and never had another look after that as her error count grew and her opponent’s confidence rose.
“I’m proud of myself how I fought and I tried, but just was not — tennis-wise I felt like (I) just wasn’t there, especially in the important moments when I kept creating those opportunities,” said Azarenka.
“Not a great feeling right now to digest.

Babar is only the second Pakistan cricketer to win the prestigious award after Shaheen Shah Afridi, who won it in 2021. The 28-year-old was also named as the Men’s ODI Player of the Year.
Across formats, Babar scored 2598 runs in 44 matches at an average of 54.12, which included eight centuries and 15 half-centuries. Apart from this, Pakistan also reached the 2022 T20 World Cup final under his captainship. This, despite of losing their opening two matches in the competition to India and Zimbabwe.

Babar was the only player to breach the 2000 run mark in the year gone by. The Men’s ODI Player of the Year for the past two years continued his form in the 50-over format, scoring  679 runs in nine matches.
In Tests, despite Pakistan winning only one of their nine matches, the captain accumulated 1184 runs from the same. A memorable moment of him in the whites arrived in the second Test against Australia in Karachi.
With Pakistan requiring 506 runs to win in close to six sessions that remained, Babar notched up 196 runs off 425 deliveries and walked off to a standing ovation, having scored the highest by a Test captain in the fourth innings of a Test.

Bayern Munich struggling with off-pitch issues as Eintracht await,"Bayern, who have a busy few weeks ahead with a German Cup match as well as their Champions League last-16 tie against Paris St Germain next month, have 36 points ahead of Union Berlin (33), RB Leipzig (32) and Eintracht (31) in fourth.","Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga restart has been far from impressive with coach Julian Nagelsmann dealing with a lack of discipline and focus plus the fallout from goalkeeper Manuel Neuer’s injury. Nagelsmann’s title holders have drawn both of their league matches this year and when they host fellow Champions League club Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday only a win will do to make sure of preserving their three-point lead at the top.
First-choice Neuer suffered a broken leg in a skiing accident in December, triggering a frantic Bayern search for a replacement.
They signed Yann Sommer from Borussia Moenchengladbach last week but Bayern’s on-loan keeper Alexander Nuebel, who currently plays for AS Monaco, vented his frustration over a lack of communication with the German champions about his future.
That led to the sacking this week of Bayern’s longtime goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalovic, a close friend of Neuer who had joined Bayern from Schalke 04 along with his fellow keeper more than 11 years ago.
As if that problem was not enough, Bayern also criticised out-of-form winger Serge Gnabry, who flew to Paris on a day off on Sunday to attend a fashion show with pictures of the player on social media showing him dressed in various fashion brands.
“That is amateurish,” said Bayern sports director Hasan Salihamidzic. “That’s exactly what I don’t like. That is not Bayern Munich-like, to be out and about.
“When you have a free day then you need to rest in order to step on the gas during the next match.”

It’s global cricketing issue to keep players inspired for all three formats: AB de Villiers,De Villiers is part of the SA20 commentary panel. The inaugural competition has taken an eight-day break to accommodate the ODI series betweens hosts South Africa and England.,"South Africa great Ab de Villiers feels it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep players “inspired” for all three formats amid the punishing schedule, creating a pressing need for cricket boards and cricketers to have an honest communication over the latter’s preferred choice of formats.
The 38-year-old, who shocked the cricketing world with his international retirement in 2018, said his playing career too could have been managed better. Three years later, he retired from all forms of cricket.
He left the game to spend more time with family, something which has become a luxury for an all-format modern cricketer. Considering the ever-crowded international calendar and mushrooming of T20 leagues around the world, playing all three formats has become impossible without taking frequent breaks in between.
England Test captain Ben Stokes was forced to retire from ODIs last year as he could not go on giving his best across formats.
“That’s a tough question,” De Villiers told PTI when asked about the need for picking formats amid the relentless scheduling.
“Because I don’t want to be the guy to just say give up a format or two. And once again, it’s a global cricketing issue at the moment to keep the players inspired to play all formats of the game for their countries.” De Villiers believes the players’ careers could be extended if they were clear about their ambitions across formats. He also expects the cricketing boards to clearly communicate to the players over where they stand in their scheme of things.
“But I do think there’s room with the various boards around the world to pinpoint players, to have community discussions and communication early on in players’ careers, to understand what they want to achieve, first of all, and secondly, where they fit in with regards to the cricket in their own country to represent the country internationally.

“But also to be happy to play leagues around the world. And to gain experience, it’s invaluable. We spoke about it earlier, players like SKY (Suryakumar), Dewald Brevis and myself, the way we took our games to the next level, largely because of these leagues.
“So ultimately, that is what we want to achieve. If it’s not achievable. And if there’s a clear sign that a player is maybe a bit weak in one format, or is maybe not as inspired to achieve milestones to go a long way in one or two formats, then yes, but that communication needs to happen.
“And I think during my career communication could have been better from my side, but also from the Cricket South Africa side to make sure that we plan accordingly. So it comes down to communication,” said ‘Mr.360’.
De Villiers is part of the SA20 commentary panel. The inaugural competition has taken an eight-day break to accommodate the ODI series betweens hosts South Africa and England, highlighting the scheduling challenges faced by boards.

“I don’t think it is (break) ideal to be honest. So difficult to get the scheduling right and keep everyone happy. We want to see countries take each other on. It is the ultimate form of viewership but with all these leagues the excitement is there and it is financially healthy.
“It is very difficult for the ICC and everyone to make sure that the scheduling benefits everyone. I honestly don’t know what the answer is,” said de Villiers.
‘Doubt if we will ever see Indian players in overseas leagues’
=====================================
The BCCI doesn’t allow Indian players to feature in overseas T20 leagues and it is not going to change in the foreseeable future. De Villiers sees a lot of merit in BCCI’s stance.

“I would love to see it happening very soon but you don’t see Indian players being released for leagues around the world. So I don’t know if that will ever change. And rightfully so. I mean, the BCCI has a very clear plan with the players, they want to win World Cups.
“They want to make sure the players have the exposure they need and obviously there’s no league better than than the IPL.

Elena Rybakina tops Victoria Azarenka to make Australian Open women’s final,"Rybakina was born in Moscow, but she has represented Kazakhstan since 2018, when that country offered to fund her tennis career.","Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina reached her second final in the past three Grand Slam tournaments by beating Victoria Azarenka 7-6 (4), 6-3 at the Australian Open on Thursday.
Rybakina added to what already was an impressive run through a string of top opponents. Azarenka, the champion at Melbourne Park in 2012 and 2013, joined a list of players eliminated by Rybakina over the past two weeks that includes No. 1 Iga Swiatek and No. 17 Jelena Ostapenko — both owners of major titles — and 2022 Australian Open runner-up Danielle Collins.
As usual, Rybakina did it with her powerful serve, delivering it at up to 117 mph (189 kph) and accumulating nine aces Thursday to bring her total to a tournament-high 44, and stinging groundstrokes that she used to close points seemingly at will. The performance was particularly noteworthy against a returner and defender as established on hard courts as Azarenka, a former No. 1 and a three-time runner-up at the U.S. Open.
In Saturday’s final, Rybakina will take on either No. 5 Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus or unseeded Magda Linette of Poland. Sabalenka took a 9-0 mark in 2023 into Thursday’s second semifinal, while Linette made it to that stage of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 30 appearances.
Rybakina is just 23, 10 years younger than Azarenka, and the future sure looks bright at the moment.
Rybakina might be seeded just 22nd in Melbourne, and ranked just 25th, but those numbers are quite misleading and not indicative at all of her talent and form. She did not get the usual bump from her title last July at Wimbledon, where zero rankings points were awarded after the All England Club banned players from Russia and Belarus because of the invasion of Ukraine.
Rybakina was born in Moscow, but she has represented Kazakhstan since 2018, when that country offered to fund her tennis career.

It was breezy and chilly at Rod Laver Arena from the start of Rybakina vs. Azarenka, with the temperature dipping below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).
That could have played a role in the way the first set was as much of a seesaw as can be, with each player seeming to gain the upper hand — and then ceding it just as quickly.
Rybakina’s occasional inconsistency was encapsulated by the very first game. She began, inauspiciously enough, with a double-fault, before holding with the help of three aces.
Azarenka nosed ahead by breaking for a 3-2 lead on a leaping, full-extension volley winner with both women at the net. Rybakina, though, broke right back, and then once more to go up 5-3.
ADVERTISEMENT
That allowed Rybakina to serve for the set, and she was a point from owning it at 40-30. But Azarenka conjured up a terrific down-the-line forehand passing shot to erase that chance, and wound up taking the game with a big backhand winner she accented with a shout of “Let’s go!”
A mistake-filled tiebreaker ended with Azarenka pushing a forehand wide to cap an 11-shot exchange, and the set now did belong to Rybakina. She broke at love for a 2-1 lead in the second, and while they would continue to play for another 25 minutes, the outcome was never really much in doubt.
Sure, Rybakina again faltered for a bit while trying to serve out the victory at 5-2. No one expected Azarenka to go quietly. But one last break, aided by a double-fault from Azarenka, allowed Rybakina to take another step toward another trophy.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/rybakina-azarenka-australian-open-womens-final-8406333/,sports

"Rory McIlroy snubs Patrick Reed, in no mood for reconciliation in Dubai","As one of the most vocal critics of the LIV Golf breakaway league, McIlroy felt mentally drained at the end of last year and decided to put his clubs away for a few weeks.","Another battle between Rory McIlroy and Patrick Reed began to take shape Wednesday.
As one of the most vocal critics of the LIV Golf breakaway league, McIlroy felt mentally drained at the end of last year and decided to put his clubs away for a few weeks.

— Golf Tips Checker (@GolfTipsChecker) January 25, 2023
“It’s been nice,” the top-ranked McIlroy said, “to try to take a little bit of time away, and try to sort of distance myself from the game of golf.”
Now he’s back and appears to be as fiery as ever.
Read | Golf: Patrick Reed allegedly throws golf tee at rival Rory McIlroy in disgust
McIlroy was on the driving range Tuesday at the Dubai Desert Classic when he was approached by Reed, one of the high-profile players to have joined the exodus to the Saudi-backed series that changed the face of golf in 2022.
McIlroy said he was busy practicing and didn’t feel the need to acknowledge Reed.
“Patrick came up to say hello and I didn’t really want him to,” McIlroy said Wednesday.
McIlroy was asked about reports the American threw a tee toward him. The four-time major winner said he didn’t see or feel anything.
ADVERTISEMENT
”But apparently that’s what happened,” McIlroy said. “And if roles were reversed and I’d have thrown that tee at him, I’d be expecting him (to file) a lawsuit.”
""I just didn't want to talk to him.""

— Sky Sports (@SkySports) January 25, 2023
McIlroy said he was served a subpoena on Christmas Eve from Larry Klayman, an attorney who has filed a lawsuit against the PGA Tour and European tour for suspending players who have signed with LIV Golf. Reed is not involved in that lawsuit.
Klayman also represents Reed in lawsuits filed against a number of media outlets.
“Of course, trying to have a nice time with my family and someone shows up on your doorstep and delivers that, you’re not going to take that well,” McIlroy said.
It’s clear McIlroy is in no mood for reconciliation in Dubai.
ADVERTISEMENT
“So again, I’m living in reality, I don’t know where he’s living. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn’t expect a hello or a handshake.”
Reed, in a statement provided by Klayman, wanted to make clear he had nothing to do with the subpoena McIlroy received.
“So, McIlroy being upset about being served on Christmas Eve has absolutely nothing to do with Patrick Reed,” the statement said. “So we don’t know what world McIlroy is living in, but we live in the real world, and to try to lay blame on Patrick Reed or being upset with Patrick for being subpoenaed for a lawsuit that Patrick Reed is not a part of is simply ignorant.”
Reed said in Dubai it was “unfortunate” that McIlroy didn’t shake his hand.
ADVERTISEMENT
“But it is one of those things — if you’re going to act like an immature little child then you might as well be treated like one,” Reed was quoted as saying by British newspaper The Daily Mail.
Reed said he “flicked” a tee toward McIlroy because it had a logo of the 4 Aces, his team in LIV Golf, on it.
“It was kind of a funny shot back,” Reed said.
Reed and McIlroy had a memorable singles match in the 2016 Ryder Cup at Hazeltine, which Reed won. They also were in the final round at the 2018 Masters, where Reed had a three-shot lead and went on to win. The Masters is the one major McIlroy has not won.
ADVERTISEMENT
McIlroy was later asked if it would be beneficial to “fix your relationship” with another LIV rebel, Sergio Garcia, if it would help Europe’s cause ahead of this year’s Ryder Cup.
“No,” was the Northern Irishman’s blunt response.
The toll taken on McIlroy for effectively being an anti-LIV spokesman didn’t stop him returning to the top of the world ranking at the end of last year.
His last competitive tournament was the World Tour Championship, which was also in Dubai, in November.
McIlroy said the break gave him the opportunity to “recharge and reset and try to start 2023 with renewed optimism,” and he is back in the Middle East with some unfinished business.
ADVERTISEMENT
In last year’s Dubai Desert Classic, McIlroy was in a share of the lead after 71 holes but bogeyed the par-5 No. 18 on Sunday after hitting his second shot into the water in front of the green. He finished a shot behind Viktor Hovland and Richard Bland, and Hovland wound up winning a playoff.

“Wasn’t quite the way I wanted to finish it off,” McIlroy said. “But you know, I went on from that week and played really well and had a great year.”
McIlroy is a two-time winner of the event — in 2009, which was his first title as a pro at the age of 19, and in 2015 — and enjoys coming to this part of the world.

But he told reporters he’s been hooked up to biomechanical machines rather than be connected to any human while keeping his legs ready for all the gliding and twisting during his winning for a persistent hamstring injury.
“To be honest, I’ve been connected to machines more than I have been connected to anybody else or my bed or anything else really in the days off,” Djokovic told reporters after coolly packing off fifth seed Andrey Rublev 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 on Wednesday to reach his 44th grand slam semi-final and 10th at Melbourne Park.

“Last two matches, playing against two guys that are really good players, in-form players, to beat them dominantly in three sets is something that is definitely something that I want in this moment, something that sends a message to all my opponents remaining in the draw,” he told reporters.

"Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games Bill, including controversial surveillance plans, moves closer to law: Insidethegames","Insidethegames reported that the French National Bar Council, French Communist Party and environmental campaigners are among the groups who have voiced opposition, despite the assurances of Oudéa-Castéra.","A controversial Olympic and Paralympic Games Bill allowing for the usage of video surveillance and a wider opening of shops on Sundays has moved one step closer to entering French law after the Senate adopted the amended 19-article version, according to Insidethegames.
“A formal vote is scheduled for next Tuesday (January 31) in the Senate, followed by an examination of the Bill in the National Assembly. Eight of the articles specifically relate to the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics, with enhanced security measures the most contentious. The Bill would grant power to the authorities “on an experimental basis” for “the use of algorithmic processing on the images captured by video protection devices and drones in order to detect and report events”, the website added. “This is aimed at detecting “abandoned objects” and allowing “statistical analyses” to help manage crowd movements in transport.”
Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra had to issue guarantees “that this will not feature facial recognition technology.” Security has become a thorny issue after the widely criticised management of May’s UEFA Champions League final at the Stade de France and plans for 600,000 people to attend the Opening Ceremony along the River Seine.
Insidethegames reported that the French National Bar Council, French Communist Party and environmental campaigners are among the groups who have voiced opposition, despite the assurances of Oudéa-Castéra.
The controversy pertains the time period. “The group of Senators failed in a bid for the experimental period to end in September 2024, rather than June 2025 as outlined in the bill.”
Security measures & Sunday holiday rights
Insidethegames reported that other security measures allow for the use of “airport-style body scanners” at events of more than 300 people under certain conditions, including “express” consent by visitors.
Which shops stay open on Sundays is also a bone of contention given worker rights. “Another notable change expands the range of shops able to open on Sundays because of the “exceptional need” of hosting the Games.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Food, clothing and electronics stories and services including hairdressers are set to be permitted to open on Sundays in municipalities where Paris 2024 venues are located for the period from June 1 to September 30 in 2024. Businesses require approval from a local prefect to receive authorisation to open on Sundays during this period. This comes with the provision that work for employees on Sundays must be on a voluntary basis or at double pay rate.”
The problem arises because Sunday remains deemed a day of rest in France, and there are restrictions on the opening of businesses.
Genetic tests
Other articles in the Bill allow for the use of genetic tests to comply with international anti-doping standards, making it possible to detect gene doping, transfusions and sample substitutions, and make it an offence to enter the field of play, according to Insidethegames.

It’s their house, I just live there sometimes.”","Jofra Archer revealed “he went a bit crazy” tending to five dogs during his injury rehabilitation period, though the dogs helped him cope with loneliness and rigours of long-term rehab after a career-threatening elbow injury. “I went a bit crazy probably a month after I got back to Barbados, I got about five dogs in the space of four weeks,” he said in Bloemfontein as part of England’s 14-man squad preparing for a three-match One-Day International series against South Africa.
England will owe gratitude to “five American pitbulls in helping Jofra Archer return to fitness after 18 months out of the game,” according to Guardian, should he play a leading role in the Ashes this summer. For Archer the series offers the chance of a first England appearance since March 2021 after spending most of the last year “shovelling lots of poo and feeding lots of dogs.”
Archer began his comeback with three games for MI Cape Town in the country’s new T20 League, the SA20, (File)
The Guardian wrote: “When he wasn’t walking his canine companions on the beach he was “shouting at the television” watching his England teammates win the T20 World Cup: “The most frustrating part was not being able to help,” he said.”
Apparently the dogs helped him cope and Guardian quoted him as saying he never doubted he would return to his best: “I know whenever I’m fully fit, I don’t think there’s much that can stop me, it’s just a matter of when that was going to be. Luckily everything happened a lot sooner – well, I wish it happened a lot sooner – but I’m not going to be upset or bitter about how the timing’s been. I think everything happens for a reason and I guess there’s a reason I’m here in South Africa right now,.
“There’s no reason to look back, I’ve done my time and I’m here now. I had the best time being injured, I had stuff to keep me going, my friends, my family, the gym. I don’t think I wasted any days. I’m happy.”
Archer began his comeback with three games for MI Cape Town in the country’s new T20 League, the SA20, over the past couple of weeks, and “the silky action, slippery pace and deceptive skills all appeared to be undiminished by his leave of absence. But even the smoothest of fast bowlers feel pain,” Guardian wrote
“(It may have) looked fantastic but on the inside, I’m still a bit stiff and trying to take some of the rust away. I’d probably say I’m about 80%. Just some fine-tuning now, more discipline than actual cricket stuff.”

He was looking ahead to the double. “Hopefully it can be a repeat of 2019. We’ve got the World Cup and an Ashes in the same year so more of the same, please. It’s just been good to play cricket and not have to worry about if my body’s going to give way,” Archer said. “Itis an exciting prospect to think about playing with the guys again especially with the brand of cricket they are playing which is very exciting. But I think I need to spend the next two, three, four months fine-tuning the body and making myself a bit more resilient. Let me sort that out first then I can look forward to holding the red ball in my hand again.

Russian athletes could participate in Asian competitions: IOC,The IOC had recommended that events in Russia be cancelled or relocated and that Russian and Belarusian athletes not take part or compete under a neutral flag.,"Russian and Belarusian athletes could participate in Asian events with the International Olympic Committee looking at options for their return to international competitions. The IOC said on Wednesday the Olympic Council of Asia had offered Russian and Belarusian athletes the chance to compete in Asia.
The IOC said in a statement it “welcomed and appreciated the offer from the Olympic Council of Asia to give these (Russian and Belarusian) athletes access to Asian competitions”.
That could potentially also include Olympic qualifying events, with Russian and Belarusian athletes unable to compete in Europe due to various restrictions and bans as well as opposition caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The IOC is eager to include Russian and Belarusian athletes as neutrals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, which would mean competing under the Olympic flag, but it is still unclear if and how they could qualify.
Some national Olympic committees, including Olympic heavyweights United States, have backed the possible return of those athletes under a neutral flag. The IOC said following consultation with stakeholders that “no athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport”.
A pathway for their return to competition “under strict conditions” should be further explored, it said.
These would include no active support of the war in Ukraine and strict doping testing. “The vast majority in each of the consultation meetings (with Olympic stakeholders) requested the IOC to continue the exploration of the above-mentioned concept by way of bilateral consultation, with each International Federation being the sole authority for its international competitions,” it said in the statement.
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, many sports bodies have moved events and suspended Russian teams or athletes while sponsors ended contracts in protest against the war.

"Government unhappy with wrestlers’ behaviour, unlikely to reconstitute oversight committee",Both May Kom and Yogeshwar are also part of the the seven-member committee formed by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to probe the allegations of sexual harassment and corruption against the WFI chief. ,"The government is unhappy with the wrestlers’ behaviour and will not reconstitute the oversight committee formed to probe the sexual harassment charges against WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, Sports Ministry sources said on Wednesday.
Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had on Monday announced that a five-member oversight committee, headed by legendary boxer M C Mary Kom, will investigate the charges against the Wrestling Federation of India boss and also manage the day-to-day affairs of the sports body.
Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sarita Mor and Sakshi Malik, who staged a sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar for three days demanding the sacking of the WFI president, expressed disappointment that they were not consulted before the formation of the committee.
“The ministry has no plans to reconstitute the oversight committee to probe the allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh,” a ministry source told PTI on Wednesday.
“We have formed a fair committee under Mary Kom which will go into the details of the matter,” said the source, adding that the government is unhappy with the wrestlers’ behaviour as they went public with their reservations on the formation of the committee.
According to sources, the protesting wrestlers consider the London Olympics bronze medallist Yogeshwar close to the WFI president. In fact, when Yogeshwar backed the under-fire Sharan, Vinesh had said that he was “sitting on WFI’s lap.” The wrestlers had taken to twitter to express their dismay on Tuesday.
However on Wednesday, Bajrang clarified that the grapplers don’t have an issue with Yogeshwar but they expected to be consulted before the members were finalised.

“We would like to speak with the Sports Minister after the Republic Day celebrations. We don’t have any problem with any members in the committee but we should have been consulted,” Bajrang Punia told PTI.
Asked if no names were discussed with them, Bajrang said, “A discussion had happened and these names came up but we were told to come back on the names after discussion.
“But the names were announced before we replied in affirmative. Government should not be unhappy with us. What have we done, we are fighting for justice,” he added. Apart from Yogeshwar, ex-badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, ex-TOPS CEO Rajagopalan and former SAI executive director – teams – Radhica Sreeman are also member of the committee.
Both May Kom and Yogeshwar are also part of the the seven-member committee formed by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to probe the allegations of sexual harassment and corruption against the WFI chief.

Besides legendary boxer Mary Kom and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, the IOA panel includes archer Dola Banerjee and Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF) president and IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav.
The other members of the IOA committee are two advocates — Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra — besides former shuttler and IOA joint secretary Alaknanda Ashok, who is its vice chairperson.
The agitating wrestlers, including young Anshu Malik, Sangeeta Phogat and Sonam Malik among others, started the sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar here on Wednesday and demanded the sacking of the WFI chief. The wrestlers had accused Sharan, who is also a BJP MP, of acting like a dictator and sexually harassing junior wrestlers.

Scandal hits another Olympic sport in France – handball,"Martini is the latest leader of an Olympic sport in France under police investigation in the countdown to the 2024 Games, which open in Paris in just under 550 days.","The head of France’s professional handball league has been taken in for police questioning in a child sexual assault and pornography probe, French prosecutors said Wednesday, the latest sports scandal in the country ahead of next year’s Paris Olympics.
The Paris prosecutor’s office said Bruno Martini was taken into custody Monday morning on suspicion of attempted sexual assault on a 15-year-old, of corrupting a minor and recording pornographic images of children. The president of the National Handball League was then released Tuesday night ahead of an expected plea deal on the child corruption and pornography charges, the prosecutor’s office said.
Before moving into handball management, Martini was a star player, keeping goal in 202 appearances for the French national team. He’s the latest leader of an Olympic sport in France under police investigation in the countdown to the 2024 Games, which open in Paris in just under 550 days.
French soccer federation president Noël Le Graët is under investigation for sexual harassment and “moral harassment.” French rugby federation president Bernard Laporte is appealing a two-year suspended sentence that a Paris court handed down last month. He was found guilty of passive corruption, influence peddling, illegal interest-taking and misuse of corporate assets.
The head of the Paris Games organizing committee, Tony Estanguet, expressed hope Wednesday that the various cases will progress quickly “so we can turn the page.”
“French sports need stability,” he said. “We hope things quickly return to normal.”
The National Handball League’s executive committee held an emergency meeting Wednesday to consider Martini’s position and said it was expecting his resignation as president, calling it “probable and desirable.”

Bayern Munich rebukes Gnabry for ‘amateurish’ Paris fashion visit,Bayern players' off-field activities have been in focus after goalkeeper Manuel Neuer broke his leg while skiing.,"Bayern Munich sporting director Hasan Salihamidžic has criticized forward Serge Gnabry for an “amateurish” trip to Paris Fashion Week in between games as Bayern’s new year got off to a mixed start with two draws.
Gnabry posted pictures of himself in various outfits on Instagram Sunday during a day off after Bayern drew 1-1 with Leipzig on Saturday. He was back in the team for Tuesday’s game with Cologne but was substituted at halftime as Bayern needed a 90th-minute goal to salvage another 1-1 draw.

"‘Akashdeep, Manpreet, Mandeep and Lalit (Upadhyay) didn’t participate (in shootout). Sometimes, the senior players don’t want to do it’: Ric Charlesworth ",Legendary Aussie coach Ric Charlesworth points fingers at senior Indian players who stayed away from the firing line against NZ as the team was bundled out of contention.,"Ric Charlesworth stands next to a cutout of World Cup mascot Olly, and goes on a nostalgia trip about his long association with India. He’s been coming to the country even before many players of this generation were born, the Australian legend says. And his decades-long relationship with India has continued – first as a player for his home country and then as coach of the Kookaburras leading them to unprecedented heights.
An outsider who knows the inner workings of Indian hockey, it was on the recommendation of Charlesworth – who had a short stint as technical director of Indian hockey – that Graham Reid, his former assistant with Australia, chose to come to India as head coach. And while India’s early exit from the hockey World Cup may have surprised many, Charlesworth could see the signs: from prolonged celebrations of the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics to losing by big margins coming into the tournament.
Excerpts from an interview:
How do you look at India’s performance?
In the first couple of games, India were pretty good against good opponents. But, maybe, then they started to believe the local publicity rather than going, ‘okay, Wales are a tough team’. And, you know, they nearly had a stumble against Wales, and against New Zealand.
So what you need is constant vigilance. And the result in Tokyo, which was so good, India celebrated for a while. You have to get out of that mode and say, ‘what do we have to improve and get better?’ Because three years later, you have to be better, you have to improve. That’s part of the long story.
Then, you look at the detail of the game (against New Zealand). And in the game, India had any number of chances to win it. The inability to finish, maybe, reflects anxiety. I think when it comes to the shootout that was probably the case because when you get there, people start thinking about the outcome rather than the process. Graham Reid said it any number of times, but it has to be in your DNA.
Can you introduce that DNA in a team and an individual?
Yeah. Many people have commented about the shootout. You had Akashdeep (Singh), Manpreet (Singh), Mandeep (Singh) and Lalit (Upadhyay) who didn’t participate. For all sorts of reasons, I had the same problem in our team. Sometimes, the senior players don’t want to do it. But they have the skill. And it’s a skill. You have to learn it in practice.
ADVERTISEMENT
And senior players are not willing to do that because…?
Whatever the reason, but they can do it. When I was a player, I used to take penalty strokes and I practised a lot. I got to the stage where I could flick in any corner with the same action. And it’s that preparation that gives you the confidence you can do it.
Those players have the skill. Now, sometimes it’s a good idea to put in a new player. He wouldn’t feel this and no one has seen him before. But in the mix, I’m surprised that some of those players were involved in that shootout because you then had the opportunity to win it. Harmanpreet (Singh) decides to do something that he hasn’t done before. Why is that? That’s pressure.
Bhubaneswar: Indian captain Manpreet Singh with teammate Akashdeep Singh during a practice session ahead of the match against Wales at the FIH Odisha Hockey Men’s World Cup 2023, at Kalinga Hockey Stadium in Bhubaneswar, Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2023. (PTI)
Do you see India as a team that plays well in moments rather than some elite teams that manage to control the game for all 60 minutes?
ADVERTISEMENT
You have to develop a team that can play constantly, consistently all the time. You look at the first goal against New Zealand; that was loose. Just before halftime, the game was under control. And it was loose. Why does that happen? That is usually because there’s not the vigilance that there needs to be.
But if you watch that game, New Zealand were in India’s circle in the first seconds of the game, and constantly got there in all four quarters. That’s the thing that worries me the most. Usually, teams get in there because of mistakes by the defence more than brilliant play… And what’s the thing that brings you down the most? It’s the skill execution, the movement off the ball… Against New Zealand, that ball from Simon Child for the first goal, Nilakanta (Sharma) wasn’t sharp enough to get close. If he gets closer, it’s harder for Child to get the ball across. It’s never one thing. It’s a range of things. The ball got fired past Harmanpreet, he wasn’t (sharp)… someone gets a touch on the ball and it rolls over the sideline rather than going to someone who is standing in front of the net. And in the end, all those little details add up to the result of the game and you have to pay attention to them.
You know Graham pretty well, what must he be thinking?
He’d be shattered, and concerned. If I was Graham Reid, the questions I’d ask would be: Did we do everything we should have? Have I got all of the things that I want to be part of this programme? Every programme can be improved. India’s had lots of changes of coaches over a period of time and I am sure, 18 months out from the Olympics, you got matches ahead, there’s the Asian Games… Qualification for the Olympics is hard. So that will be a tough time for the programme going forward.

You mentioned Tokyo. Do you think the crowd factor also matters? At the Olympics, they played in front of empty stands. Here they had 20,000 people in Rourkela. 15,000 here…
It can be easier to play away than at home, the expectation and pressure are sometimes greater. We (Australia) never played at home except for the Sydney Olympics, which was the only tournament where I coached when we were playing at home. We won in Holland twice, we won in Dublin playing against Argentina, and we won in India playing against Germany. Sometimes, the pressure is greater for the home team than for other teams. So I think that it’s a real factor.
Something goes wrong, and the players start to focus on the outcome rather than the next thing they have to do on the field. I said before the tournament that your defence had to be skilled, organised and diligent. And you would think (India’s) defence is skilled but not as organised and diligent as they ought to be.
Would you have done anything differently?
That’s hypothetical. I have no idea what’s happening inside the Indian team. Inevitably, there will be a post mortem. The team lost Hardik Singh and that takes an edge off the group. But the young player Rajkumar (Pal) came in. He did well but he’s not Hardik. Then, are you better off with two corner (specialists) at the top? You had Rupinder Pal Singh and Harmanpreet at the Olympics. That makes it harder for the runner. I was talking to some of the penalty corner-takers, the pitch is a little bit difficult for them.
Difficult in what way, is it softer?
ADVERTISEMENT
Well, I don’t know. You have to get it right… If you try to go low, there’s some drag on the turf. And therefore, if you want to lift, you have to get it perfect. Everybody is saying things like this. Harmanpreet missed the pick-up in every game. You watch them in practice, and they are doing better but in matches, there is more pressure. So those details make a difference when you add them all up.
Rickworth: ‘The young player Rajkumar (Pal, centre) came in. He did well but he’s not Hardik.’ (PTI)
You mentioned Hardik’s absence, the lack of support for Harmanpreet after Rupinder retired. It points to bench strength… I don’t know how the structure is in Australia but they seem to have a solid backup for every position.
I’m sure India has that. When you’re coaching, you have alternatives in every position. At the 2014 World Cup, we replaced two players just before the tournament started because of injuries. But no one would have even known who was a substitute and who wasn’t.
But knowing India, they have a good junior team, they have a good backup, and they have the structures, which are more solid than they were 10 years ago when I was here. The Hockey India League helped a lot. But it hasn’t been there for the last five years. So that’s a pity because I think that really gave local players a boost. They played next to international players, and realised they only had two arms and two legs and that they could compete with them. But I think India has depth and quality of players, I don’t have any doubts about that.
Is it a question of belief post-HIL?
ADVERTISEMENT
I’m not sure. The Indian Premier League was a critical factor in India’s cricket becoming more and more confident. So it would be helpful if it was there. I’m sure. That’s an issue for the administration, the FIH and the windows that they create.
How do you look at Indian hockey’s overall structure?
When I was here, there were lots of small programmes developing players but not with quality facilities or coaches. I don’t know whether or not that’s changed. But I think the central structure has changed dramatically. The administration is solid and sound, there seems to be really good rigour about the way in which things happen. From the outside, it looks good.
Ten years ago, I had said it would be 10 years (for Indian hockey to improve). This (World Cup) is a pothole on the highway. Also, when you look at the macro vision of India, you have to also look at the women’s team. They have been making steady progress along with the men. And so, these 10 years are dramatically better notwithstanding the pothole, which is the recent performance.

But there were signs along the way. The Commonwealth Games final was a sign. Even the series against Australia… that everything is not right.
And by signs, you mean…
The big losses. That usually doesn’t happen. So that is a worry…
Going forward, what should be the steps to course-correct?
Teams change all the time. Teams are dynamic things, they’re not static. And if they become static, they become sclerotic. So you have to change. But you have to make a judgment on each player.
There are things that you would want to improve in the coaching structure. Like the fitness staff. Those who were with India for the Olympics aren’t there anymore. Why is that? They weren’t offered appropriate salaries? They went somewhere else, working with other countries now. Those sorts of things. Does India have someone who’s an expert in human behaviour working in their programme? I don’t know.
Did you have that with Australia?
ADVERTISEMENT
Of course, always, since the 1990s. It’s very critical. The most important thing is, every coach is a psychologist, but they’re not experts. You need people whose expertise is human behaviour in every elite programme because of the issue of handling the pressure and dealing with the process rather than the outcome.

Fans questioned by police over Russian flags at Australian Open,"Tennis Australia did not provide details, but a video emerged on social media showing a fan on the steps of Rod Laver Arena holding up a Russian flag with the image of President Vladimir Putin on it.","Four supporters at the Australian Open with “inappropriate flags and symbols” are being questioned by Victoria Police following the quarter-final between Russia’s Andrey Rublev and favourite Novak Djokovic, organisers Tennis Australia said on Wednesday.

Tennis Australia did not provide details, but a video emerged on social media showing a fan on the steps of Rod Laver Arena holding up a Russian flag with the image of President Vladimir Putin on it.
Russian and Belarusian flags are banned from Melbourne Park during the Australian Open after a complaint from the Ukraine ambassador to the country last week. Belarus is a key staging ground for Russia’s war in Ukraine, which Moscow terms a “special operation”.
“Four people in the crowd leaving the stadium revealed inappropriate flags and symbols and threatened security guards. Victoria Police intervened and are continuing to question them,” Tennis Australia said in a statement.
“The comfort and safety of everyone is our priority and we work closely with security and authorities.”
Photos on social media also showed one fan in the crowd during the quarter-final with a large “Z” on his shirt.

Tennis Australia responded by immediately banning the flags of Russia and Belarus. Russian and Belarusian players were banned from Wimbledon last year but are able to compete as individual athletes without national affiliation at the Australian Open.

First priority is to get 100 percent fit: Jadeja,"Very excited. Hopefully it will come good as a team and as an individual also,"" Jadeja, who will lead Saurashtra in their final Ranji Trophy Group B league match against Tamil Nadu beginning here on Tuesday, told reporters.","Star India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who is making a return to competitive cricket after close to six months, on Monday said his first priority is to get “100 percent” match fit ahead of the crucial Test series against Australia. “I am feeling good to be back on the field.
Very excited. Hopefully it will come good as a team and as an individual also,” Jadeja, who will lead Saurashtra in their final Ranji Trophy Group B league match against Tamil Nadu beginning here on Tuesday, told reporters.
“…See my first priority is to get on the field and be fit…100 per cent fit. Once I am 100 per cent fit, I will work more on my skills, whether it is batting or bowling. Now, my first priority is fitness…” Jadeja had to undergo a knee surgery last year after playing for India last in August.
He said he had spent time at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru and added that he wanted game time before the Test series against the visiting Australians.
“I was at the NCA for 20 days. I was doing batting and bowling. Match scenario is different. I wanted one game before the Australia series, that’s why I am here.” He has been picked in the India squad for the first two Tests subject to fitness.
When asked if there was any discomfort now, Jadeja said: “Not really…after five months I am playing competitive cricket, so you don’t feel confident initially. “But as you progress, then definitely you get better and better. Injury is part of any sport. If you get injured, you have to start from scratch. The same thing in cricket.
“I was out of action for 5 months. I have to build my fitness. Once I get the confidence, I will definitely work on my skills and I will get better day by day.” He mentioned that it probably was his longest time out of the game.
“I think so…because of surgery.”
Jadeja revealed it was a ligament tear.

“You feel bad. Nobody wants to get injured at your peak time. It is part of the game. You have to keep that in mind and be prepared for it. You can’t do anything. There is no guarantee that one won’t get injured in cricket.
“It was a ligament tear. It is coming good. I am slowly getting confident.” Jadeja emphasised that though he had been practising at the NCA, a match is a different ball game.
“As I said, a match is a different thing. Different ball game…I will try to give my 100 per cent. I will try to go slowly, slowly. Let’s see how my leg is feeling and then we will see.” With star keeper-batter Rishabh Pant expected to be out of action for a considerable time after being involved in a road mishap last month, the focus would be on the player to don the big gloves in the Tests against the Aussies and Jadeja gave both Srikar Bharat and Ishan Kishan a thumbs up for the role. “I am comfortable with everyone. First, I need to be comfortable…(laughs) They both are very good keepers. Srikar Bharat is coming into the squad now. He has to learn a lot of things. He will learn and get better and better as he plays more number of games,” Asked how challenging it was mentally to return to full fitness, the ace all-rounder said, “Actually, fortunately I was busy with some other things…It helped me a lot.

Absence of Williamson opportunity to try out new formations: Mitchell,"Besides Williamson, New Zealand are without the services of pacers Trent Boult and Tim Southee, while coach Gary Stead has also given the white-ball series a miss.","New Zealand might be without some of their senior players, including skipper Kane Williamson, but all-rounder Daryl Mitchell feels the tour of India is helping the Black Caps try out new formations and different balances.
Besides Williamson, New Zealand are without the services of pacers Trent Boult and Tim Southee, while coach Gary Stead has also given the white-ball series a miss.
“Not having Kane here I think is a great opportunity for the group to test out some new formations and different balances and give some of the guys the experience of playing in India.
“I think it’s a great chance for us to keep building to where we want to be as a group,” Mitchell said on the eve of the third ODI here.
New Zealand trail the three-match series 0-2.
The top-order has struggled immensely to contribute runs. In the opener, the Kiwis seemed down and out at 131-6, before number seven Michael Bracewell played a blinder to almost take them over the line.
However, Bracewell could not repeat the feat as the visitors were skittled out for a paltry 108 in the second match, in Raipur. But Mitchell is not thinking too much about last Saturday’s performance.
“Everyone knows that games of cricket like the other day (second ODI) happen, it’s the nature of the game, you lose the toss and get out on a slightly challenging surface.
ADVERTISEMENT
“As a group, we are pretty liberal we don’t run the highs too much or the lows. Just stay consistent. So, really excited about tomorrow,” he added.
With the ODI World Cup scheduled to be played in India later this year, New Zealand will be keen to pick up at least one win to boost their morale.

"Australian Open Day 8: Novak Djokovic, Aryna Sabalenka make statements; Sania-Bopanna advance",All the notable results from day 8 of the 2023 Australian Open.,"In perhaps the biggest statement of his tournament so far, Novak Djokovic fought off a partisan crowd and a tight hamstring to blow past 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 to reach the quarterfinal of the Australian Open.
The match seemed tense in the first four games of the first set, before the Serb won nine games in a row, and 15 of the next 16, to storm to a routine win. Djokovic’s level was far beyond any other player in the men’s draw, and his own recent performances. H seemed undisturbed by the physical issues that had cast a shadow over his last round, painting the lines with winners off the backhand, forehand, and return, and failing to drop a single service game.
Djokovic takes on fifth seed Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinal, who pulled off a massive upset of his own. The Russian defeated ninth seed Holger Rune 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (9), saving three match points, and coming back from 0-5 down in the deciding set 10-point tiebreak.

In the women’s draw, big-hitting Aryna Sabalenka stormed to another straight-sets win – her eighth in a row, leaving her unbeaten in 2023 – defeating the in-form Belinda Bencic 7-5, 6-2. Sabalenka’s vastly improved serve, and massive natural power, were both on show in a statement-making win that has strengthened her status as the favourite to win a maiden Grand Slam in Melbourne. She takes on Croatia’s Donna Vekic in the quarterfinal.
Fourth seed Carolina Garcia did not fare as well, after falling to Poland’s Magda Linette 6-7 (3), 4-6. The Frenchwoman, fresh off her WTA Finals triumph, had not maintained the same level that was on show throughout the backend of last season throughout the tournament, and hit a disappointing 30 unforced errors on her forehand on Monday.

Alongside compatriot Rohan Bopanna, she defeated the pairing of Uruguay’s Ariel Behar and Japan’s Makoto Ninomiya 6-4, 7-6 (9) on Monday.
Despite losing an early break lead in the first set, Sania and Bopanna kept their cool and plugged away at their opponents, converting three of a remarkable 10 break-point opportunities.

Buffalo’s Jessica Pegula eyes 1st Slam semifinal at Australian Open,"The No. 3 Pegula is the highest-seeded woman remaining, with No. 1 Iga Swiatek and No. 2 Ons Jabeur eliminated.","At the draw ceremony for the season-ending WTA Finals in October, the emcee called Jessica Pegula to the front of the room and asked the 28-year-old American about her championship at an event in Mexico a handful of days earlier.
He called it the “biggest title” of her career. Pegula politely corrected him: “Biggest title so far,” she said, emphasizing those last two words.
Pegula chuckled when asked about that exchange during an interview with The Associated Press.
“I didn’t mean to say that, but that’s good that I said that,” she said.
“So far, that is my biggest title, so that’s factual and true — but also, hopefully, definitely not the last.” Pegula’s had a winding journey in professional tennis and, at the Australian Open, she is hoping to add by far her most significant trophy yet. When she steps on court to face 2012-13 champion Victoria Azarenka on Tuesday, Pegula will be appearing in the quarterfinals for the third year in a row at Melbourne Park — and for the fifth time overall at a major, all in the past 24 months.
The No. 3 Pegula is the highest-seeded woman remaining, with No. 1 Iga Swiatek and No. 2 Ons Jabeur eliminated.
“I have a great shot here. … All around, throughout the whole tournament, I’ve been playing the best I have,” she said Sunday after beating 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova 7-5, 6-2 in the fourth round.
ADVERTISEMENT
Pegula relies on terrific returning (she’s won a tournament-high 64% of games served by opponents) and strong defense. She uses a flat forehand and backhand slice (she’s won 61% of points played at the baseline, second-best so far).
“She plays quite simple, which is, I would say, a compliment,” Azarenka said, likening that aspect of Pegula’s approach to former No. 1 Ash Barty, who “just did certain things so well, over and over and over again.” Pegula is 0-4 so far in Slam quarterfinals, with losses to Jennifer Brady at the 2021 Australian Open, Barty at the 2022 Australian Open, and Swiatek at the 2022 French Open and 2022 U.S. Open.
“I guess, currently, seeding-wise, I’m the favourite,” Pegula said.
“I would say it feels different.”
And it’s a long way from her trying times over the last decade. There was a 2013 knee problem that required surgery, but she worked her way back from that and earned a Grand Slam main-draw debut at the 2015 U.S. Open by beating 2009 U.S. Open quarterfinalist Melanie Oudin in the last round of qualifying.
ADVERTISEMENT
Then came another health setback: A hip operation that kept Pegula out of action for more than half of 2017, dropping her ranking to No. 860 and sending her to lower-level ITF events.
Again, she regrouped and returned, claiming her first WTA title at Washington in 2019. That came shortly after beginning to work with Venus Williams’ former coach, David Witt, who has pointed to the way Pegula “started believing in herself more that she belongs up there.” In Grand Slam action, Pegula went through a seven-match losing streak that ended with a third-round showing at the 2020 U.S. Open, and she delivered her initial major quarterfinal five months later in Australia.
More steps have followed — she called them “mini-breakthroughs” — including cracking the top 10 last year.
“I was like, Wow, I broke through there,’ because I didn’t have a great Slam record. Then after that, it was … winning my first WTA event. That was a big one,” Pegula said. “So there’s all these little … milestones, I guess you could call them. I think it just kept building my confidence as I went along. I wouldn’t say there was like a huge turning point.” Another could come this week: The Pegula-Azarenka winner will face whoever emerges from Tuesday’s quarterfinal between 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina and 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko.
ADVERTISEMENT
The fourth-round matches on the bottom half of the draw were scheduled for Monday: Aryna Sabalenka vs. Belinda Bencic, Donna Vekic vs. Linda Fruhvirtova, Caroline Garcia vs. Magda Linette, and Karolina Pliskova vs. Zhang Shuai.
Pegula’s own calendar included two sporting events Monday. At 7 a.m. local time (3 p.m. Sunday EST), the NFL team that’s owned by her parents, the Buffalo Bills, hosted the Cincinnati Bengals in the playoffs — and Pegula was planning to wake up early so she could watch. Buffalo lost 27-10.
She caught part of the Bills’ AFC wild-card win over the Miami Dolphins before playing her first-round match in Melbourne, and has been wearing a patch on her skirt with the No. 3 jersey number of Buffalo safety Damar Hamlin, who went into cardiac arrest during a game three weeks ago.

"‘Disgrace’ if Djokovic not allowed to enter US and compete, says Tommy Haas",Djokovic missed last year's Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID. His three-year visa ban was overturned in November and he is back at the Grand Slam looking to win a 10th crown and 22nd major.,"Novak Djokovic could end the year as the world’s top-ranked player but it would be a “disgrace” if his chances are affected by not being able to compete in the United States due to his unvaccinated status, Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas said.
Djokovic missed last year’s Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID. His three-year visa ban was overturned in November and he is back at the Grand Slam looking to win a 10th crown and 22nd major.
The Serbian was, however, not able to travel to New York for the 2022 U.S. Open without proof of vaccination, the same reason that forced him to skip ATP 1000 events at Indian Wells and Miami earlier in the year.
U.S. authorities said this month the requirement for foreign air travellers to be vaccinated against COVID would be in place until at least April 10, meaning Djokovic will miss out on Indian Wells and Miami again.
Haas, also a former world number two player, said he hoped the rules would be relaxed sooner to allow Djokovic to compete.
“If Djokovic stays healthy, I don’t see how he’s not going to be number one,” Haas told reporters at Melbourne Park on Monday.
“Obviously the one problem being that he still cannot come to the U.S. If he doesn’t play Indian Wells and Miami in March (it will be tough), they’re supposed to lift those mandates by mid-April.

“It would be nice to see if we could maybe lift those a little earlier and have him come to play Indian Wells and Miami. I think he wants to play, so we should give him the chance. Hopefully we can have him there.

But Arsenal was finally rewarded for a period of relentless pressure over the last 10 minutes, with David De Gea having already denied Nketiah once from close range.
Marcus Rashford had put United ahead with a long-range strike in the 17th minute, but Nketiah responded seven minutes later when he headed in a cross from Granit Xhaka at the far post.
Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead for the first time in the 53rd when he collected the ball on the left flank, drove past Christian Eriksen and then curled in a strike from 25 yards that beat De Gea at the far post.

Haaland scores 4th hat trick for City in 3-0 win over Wolves,The Norway striker’s three-goal burst in a 14-minute spell either side of halftime lifted him to 25 for the season.,"Erling Haaland scored his fourth Premier League hat trick of the season to lead Manchester City to a 3-0 win over Wolverhampton as Pep Guardiola’s midweek message got through to the champions on Sunday.
The Norway striker’s three-goal burst in a 14-minute spell either side of halftime lifted him to 25 for the season. That is more than any player managed last season, when Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min shared the Golden Boot with 23 goals.
The quickest a player had previously scored four hat tricks in the Premier League was former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, in 65 appearances. It has taken Haaland just 19 matches to achieve the feat as he continues to take English soccer by storm in his first season playing in the country of his birth.

— Premier League (@premierleague) January 22, 2023
Guardiola had delivered a rocket to his players and the club’s fans after the 4-2 comeback win over Tottenham on Thursday, saying they lacked the passion and desire to fuel second-place City’s bid to claw back its deficit to Arsenal that stood at five points at kickoff Sunday.
The crowd was more in voice at Etihad Stadium this time and City’s performance seemed more energetic, albeit against an opponent battling relegation.
Haaland opened the scoring by heading home Kevin De Bruyne’s cross in the 40th minute, just as City was starting to create chances at will.
The wave of attacks continued after the break and Ilkay Gundogan was fouled in the area by Ruben Neves to give Haaland the chance to add a second from the penalty spot. He sent goalkeeper Jose Sa the wrong way in the 50th.
Sa then sloppily gave the ball away to Riyad Mahrez as he tried to play out from the back. Mahrez could have shot himself but chose to slip a short pass to Haaland, who stroked in a calm finish to complete his hat trick. His others also came at the Etihad, against Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United in successive home league games.

‘It’s very difficult’: Hugo Lloris opens up on mental and physical struggles to get over World Cup episode,"After tasting defeat at the hands of Argentina in the Qatar World Cup final in December, the under-fire star retired from France’s national duty.","“That’s the demand of the competition this year. Even if sometimes you can face difficulties you just won’t give up, you want to continue, you want to push and you want to be ready for the important period of the season,” said Hugo Lloris, recalling France’s World Cup final defeat to Argentina, as quoted by the Daily Mail.
The 36-year-old goalkeeper recently opened up about the struggles he has been facing to overcome the World Cup episode.
“You have to take into consideration that it’s not a normal season. From the beginning of September, we played every three days until the World Cup,” Lloris told Daily Mail.
After tasting defeat at the hands of Argentina in the Qatar World Cup final in December, the under-fire star retired from France’s national duty. However, ever since he returned to Spurs, Tottenham’s performance hasn’t been good enough form-wise or points-wise.
Speaking about how difficult it was to readjust to life at his team on a physical and emotional level, Lloris said, “We know we have a deficit of points and we have to run after the others to get into the top four. But there are plenty of games and we have to stay confident and positive — and also we really want to reach the level that should be ours.”

Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda says contemplating filing defamation case against WFI chief,"Talking to reporters in Rohtak, Hooda said Singh has unnecessarily dragged his name along with that of his MP-son Deepender Singh Hooda in the matter. He said he is contemplating to file a defamation case against the WFI chairman.","Senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday said he is contemplating filing a defamation case against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for allegedly dragging him and his son Deepender Hooda in the row over sexual harassment charges against Singh.
The former Haryana chief minister also reiterated his demand for an impartial inquiry into the allegations levelled against the head of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). Singh has been accused of sexually harassing women wrestlers and working like a ‘dictator’ by some of the country’s top grapplers, including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya.
Talking to reporters in Rohtak, Hooda said Singh has unnecessarily dragged his name along with that of his MP-son Deepender Singh Hooda in the matter. He said he is contemplating to file a defamation case against the WFI chairman.
Earlier speaking to a TV channel, the WFI head had said, “The protesting players have become a toy in the hands of the Congress and Deepender Hooda. This type of conspiracy was hatched against me by the Congress almost three decades ago. Once again the conspiracy has been done.
“I had earlier said that there was a conspiracy, and big powers are behind it. Now these forces are coming out in the open,” he had said.
Hooda underlined that sportspersons are the pride of the country and they should get justice.
Asked about the sexual harassment case against Haryana minister Sandeep Singh, he said, “There should be a fair inquiry into the allegations levelled against him. For this, it is necessary that Sandeep Singh steps down.” Meanwhile, Hooda said his party is fully prepared for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and the Haryana Assembly election.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the state polls due later next year, he said people have made up their minds to bring back the Congress in the state.
“This was visible in the historic support received by Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ in Haryana,” he said.
Hitting out at the BJP-JJP ruling combine in Haryana, he said, “Today there are a lot of problems before the people. The Congress will go to people on issues like corruption, unemployment, inflation, increasing crime and drug abuse.”
Supporting the demands of sugarcane farmers, Hooda said, “The farmers are demanding a rate of Rs 450 per quintal (as against the current Rs 362). The Haryana government should at least give the farmers the same rate as that of Punjab (Rs 380).” Hooda added that during the previous Congress government, there was a record increase of 165 per cent in the rate of sugarcane, while during the BJP regime, it was increased by only 17 per cent.

About Congress’ ‘Haath Se Haath Jodo’ campaign, an extension of the Bharat Jodo Yatra, the Leader of the Opposition in the assembly said the party will meet on January 25 to discuss about the event details.

He started the year with another dominating show, winning the Malaysia Super 1000 in Kuala Lumpur.","Olympic and world champion Viktor Axelsen feels the game’s governing body (BWF) should keep players’ health in mind while charting out the current international schedule as currently it is “tough”.
The 29-year-old from Odense won eight titles in 2022, including the World Championships, All England and World Tour Finals. He started the year with another dominating show, winning the Malaysia Super 1000 in Kuala Lumpur.
On Sunday, the world No. 1 Dane finished runner-up at India Open Super 750 after losing in three games to Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand in the final.
“I try to rest and prepare best way possible to keep my body in top conditions but it is not easy, especially with the travel in between tournaments, it is really tough,” he told reporters.
“All and all, you can’t expect players to keep performing week after week, that’s how it is.
“There are so many tournaments in world tour now and players health is obviously something which individual players have to take care because you can’t play everything and perform good all around the year.” Asked if there is a need to have breaks between world tour events, Axelsen said: “It is obviously good for badminton with many tournaments but we should also remember about players health.
“Having 5-6 hours flight, going from Malaysia then flying all the way to India across time zone, and flying back in same time zone, when you look at the health, and everything, it is not good and hopefully we can do better.” Talking about his targets this year, Axelsen said: “There is a world championships in Denmark, which I want to do well in. Super 1000s is something which I prioritise a lot. Last week I won one of them and hopefully I can do it again at the All England.” Kunlavut on Sunday became only the fourth player to beat Axelsen in the last 13 months and the Dane said he couldn’t mount his attack against the 21-year-old Thai sensation in the final.

“My attack and presence on court was not the best. There were few points where one went over the net in end of first game and he took the game. If I could have taken that it could have been different,” the two-time former champion said.

The 24-year-old was cheered on by his compatriots in the crowd, who showed their support by waving Greece’s flag and chanting about their tennis idol.
“I grew up in a climate that is very similar here, from the place I come from in southwestern Attica. It always reminds me of home a little bit when I’m here,” Tsitsipas told reporters.
“The conditions are similar. It’s not very humid, it’s not very tropical. I can say it’s similar to the Athenian Riviera.”
With Melbourne boasting the largest Greek population in Australia, Tsitsipas said he always felt at home when competing at the season-opening major.
“Another reason, another plus is wherever I look I see Greek faces, I see Greek people speaking Greek. Of course, it’s very important when you’re far away from home to have that sort of feeling, to connect even more with the culture that you’re at,” he said.

“It feels very welcoming when you’re able to walk around and feel that. It’s for sure my home slam, I would consider that … the French people have Roland Garros, the Brits have Wimbledon, the Americans have U.S. Open. For me it’s the Australian Open.”

Shami advises Umran: If you work on line and length you can rule the world,"The Jammu and Kashmir speedster has impressed with his express pace, bowling at 150 clicks consistently but has struggled with accuracy.","Veteran Indian pacer Mohammed Shami feels young Umran Malik, with his raw pace, has a bright future ahead and the youngster “can rule the world” if he works on his line and length.
The Jammu and Kashmir speedster has impressed with his express pace, bowling at 150 clicks consistently but has struggled with accuracy.
“There’s only one piece of advice I want to give. I don’t think it’s easy to play against the pace that you have. Just that we need to work a little on line and length. If we can get a command over it, we can rule the world.
“You have a lot of power, future is bright. Best wishes for you, hope you do well,” Shami said during a chat with Umran, which has been posted by bcci.tv.
Shami and Mohammed Siraj generated considerable seam movement to run through the New Zealand’s top-order as the hosts cantered to an eight-wicket win in the second ODI to seal the three-match series here on Saturday.
When Umran asked how he remains so calm and happy in every match, Shami said “When you are playing for the country, you shouldn’t take pressure on yourself. You should keep trusting your skills. You tend to get carried away when under pressure.
“But, when you keep your cool and keep trusting your skills, you have better opportunity to execute your plans. When you are doing well, then the importance of focussing is more.

Tri-series: Indian women start favourites against West Indies,"The Indians, without skipper Harmanpreet Kaur in the win over hosts South Africa, gave a good account of themselves in their opener.","Hoping for its seniors to return to the playing XI, the Indian team will look to continue the winning run, when it takes on the West Indies in the Women’s T20 Tri-Series match here on Monday.
The Indians, without skipper Harmanpreet Kaur in the win over hosts South Africa, gave a good account of themselves in their opener.
The captain missed the tie against South Africa owing to illness and it remains to be seen if she returns for the match against the West Indies, who are coming off a big loss against the home side.
India’s playing XI also didn’t feature the returning Shikha Pandey, Renuka Singh and Pooja Vastrakar in their first game.
Handed the India cap by stand-in skipper Smriti Mandhana, debutant Amanjot Kaur made her first outing a memorable one with a fine performance.
Reeling at 69 for five at one stage, India went ont to make a fighting 147 for six after Amanjot’s 30-ball 41 while batting at number seven.
Fitting, she was named the Player of the Match in a 27-run victory.
ADVERTISEMENT
Irrespective of whether the seniors return or not against the West Indies, a bit of focus will surely be on the 21-year-old Amanjot here on Monday, when the Women in Blue will look to consolidate their position in the tournament.
“It’s an unreal feeling. I had never thought my first match for India would go this way. This is my first press conference. And to be the Player of the Match – that was even more unexpected,” Amanjot said after the opening match here.
The tri-series is significant as it is the last tournament before the Women’s T20 World Cup which South Africa is hosting next month. The tri-series is slated to end on February 2.
Even though some seniors have taken ill and teen sensations Shafali Verma and Richa Gosh are busy with their commitments in the U-19 World Cup, India can call on the services of their ever-reliable senior all-rounder, Deepti Sharma.
ADVERTISEMENT
Deepti was at her best against the South Africans, scoring a 23-ball 33 and taking 3/30 in a brilliant all-round display. She will look for an encore in the upcoming match.
As far as the West Indies are concerned, they will need to improve in all departments if they are challenge the Indians.

Klopp grateful for small step after Liverpool-Chelsea draw,An uninspiring 0-0 draw with Chelsea in the English Premier League on Saturday was in stark contrast to the glorious performances his teams have produced during his trophy-laden time at Anfield.,"Despite reaching 1,000 games in management, Jurgen Klopp must feel like he is at the beginning of a new journey at Liverpool.
An uninspiring 0-0 draw with Chelsea in the English Premier League on Saturday was in stark contrast to the glorious performances his teams have produced during his trophy-laden time at Anfield.
His 250th game in charge of Liverpool laid bare the challenge he faces to get his struggling team back in contention for the biggest prizes.
It was only last year that the Merseyside club mounted a stirring bid for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies.
Now Liverpool sits eighth in the league — Chelsea is 10th — and belongs there after three games without a win. Liverpool is in a fight just to secure a place in the top four and next season’s Champions League.
“Arsene Wenger lost his 1,000th game 6-0 (Arsenal vs. Chelsea, 2014), so I am really happy that didn’t happen,” Klopp said.
“For me, it is clear, in this situation you have to be ready for little steps . . . and this was a little step today, that’s how it is. I expect progress and I think from the last league game (a 3-0 loss against Brighton) it was progress, definitely, and that’s important.” There are several factors behind Liverpool’s sudden decline.
ADVERTISEMENT
The impact of Sadio Mane’s move to Bayern Munich has been significant – and compounded by a host of injuries up front, with Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino all out.
Mane’s replacement, Darwin Nunez, has been inconsistent in his first season in English soccer and January signing Cody Gakpo will also need time to adapt.
Virgil van Dijk is another high-profile injury absentee, while Klopp’s aging midfield looks in need of an overhaul, with England’s Jude Bellingham widely regarded as a dream recruit.
This is a season of transition, with the FA Cup and Champions League remaining as Liverpool’s best chances of silverware after being overtaken by Manchester United and Newcastle in the league. Those teams look capable of finishing in the top four and maybe more.
MUDRYK’S INSTANT IMPRESSION
ADVERTISEMENT
On as a 55th-minute substitute, new Chelsea signing Mykhailo Mudryk injected quality into a game that looked desperately short of match-winners.
The winger’s move from Shakhtar Donetsk could be worth up to $108 million but there was little sign of that price tag weighing him down as he sparked panic in Liverpool’s defense with his dribbling and burst of pace.
“He’s had two sessions with us, but from watching him at Shakhtar, seeing his quality there, he is dangerous in one vs. one situations,” Chelsea manager Graham Potter said. “In the final third he can make things happen. He’ll get supporters off their seats,”
PRESSURE ON LAMPARD
It just gets worse for Frank Lampard after Everton lost to West Ham 2-0 in front of the Merseyside club chairman Bill Kenwright and majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri.
ADVERTISEMENT
That’s eight losses in a winless run that stretches to 10 games in all competitions.
Kenwright was asked as he left London Stadium if the latest defeat spelled the end for Lampard.
“It’s been a bad run of results for us all, and for Frank, but I would never say that to you. We’ve just got to start winning, haven’t we?” he said.
It is becoming increasingly difficult to see where Everton’s next win will come from and whether Lampard can turn his team’s fortunes around.
ADVERTISEMENT
The nature of the loss against a West Ham team that was also in desperate need of the points, deepened the doubts about Lampard’s position.
West Ham had managed just one win in its previous eight games before Saturday, but Jarrod Bowen’s first-half double lifted it out of the bottom three.
RELEGATION SCRAP
No one has been cut adrift in the fight for survival with just three points separating Leicester in 14th and bottom-of-the-table Southampton.
Leicester was denied a first win in the league since November when substitute Evan Ferguson struck in the 88th minute to earn visiting Brighton a 2-2 draw.
Nottingham Forest’s upwards trajectory continued after Sam Surridge’s 83rd-minute equalizer in a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth which dropped the Cherries into the bottom three.
ADVERTISEMENT
Forest has picked up 11 points from a possible 18 to move five points away from the drop zone.
EMERY’S VILLA TRANSFORMATION
Ollie Watkins’ 77th-minute goal secured for Aston Villa a 1-0 win against Southampton.
Villa’s rise under manager Unai Emery extended to five wins in the Spaniard’s seven league games in charge, with only one defeat.
Villa was a place above the relegation zone on goal difference when Steven Gerrard was fired in October, but is up to 11th and one point behind Liverpool and Chelsea.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We can do better,” Emery said. “We are winning some matches, but there’s more in my mind I want to do.”
NEWCASTLE MISS CHANCE
This weekend represented a chance for Newcastle to take advantage of at least one of Arsenal or Manchester United dropping points when they meet at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
Eddie Howe’s team moved back up to third, above United on goal difference after drawing at Crystal Palace 0-0. But it felt like a missed opportunity to put pressure on two of their closest rivals in the standings.
The Magpies also failed to capitalize on the draw between Liverpool and Chelsea earlier in the day by widening the gap on them.

Coco Gauff in tears after failing to crack Ostapenko code,Coco Gauff began to tear up when asked to explain her frustrations. ,"A frustrated Coco Gauff broke down in tears after her 7-5 6-3 defeat by Jelena Ostapenko at the Australian Open on Sunday, with the 18-year-old American saying she just could not come up with the answers to the Latvian’s game.
Gauff came into the tournament having enjoyed a superb 2022 where she reached the French Open final but it was former Roland Garros champion Ostapenko who dominated the contest to set up a quarter-final meeting with Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.
“I think every loss is somewhat in my control because I do feel like I’m a good player, but today she just played better,” Gauff, seeded seventh, told reporters.
“There were moments in the match where I was getting frustrated because I normally can problem solve but today I feel like I didn’t have much answers to what she was doing.
“There were balls I was hitting deep and she was hitting them on the line and hitting them back deep, like, over and over again. It’s just one of those days that just didn’t go my way and went her way.”
Gauff began to tear up when asked to explain her frustrations.
“I think it’s because I worked really hard and I felt really good coming into the tournament and I still feel good,” Gauff said. “I still feel like I’ve improved a lot.
ADVERTISEMENT
“But when you play a player like her and she plays really well, it’s like there’s nothing you can do. “So it’s a little bit frustrating on that part.”
Gauff is partnering fellow American Jessica Pegula in the women’s doubles at Melbourne Park and she said playing in the format helps her get over the disappointment of defeat.
“I think doubles has taught me how to play after losing, how to play with frustration,” Gauff added.
“So I feel like it’ll help me in the future. Bouncing back from a loss is difficult in a Grand Slam but I’m looking forward to tomorrow. I hope I can help her and I hope that she continues well in the (singles) tournament now that I’m out.

What did Ramiz Raja say about Shubman Gill’s batting,Raja also spoke about how India continued to dominate teams at home and that this enviable record needed to be replicated by Pakistan if they wanted to become a better cricketing side.,"India sealed their third straight bilateral series in a row when they won the second ODI against New Zealand in Raipur behind a scintillating bowling performance that saw the Kiwis collapse for 108. India then chased down the target with ease and former Pakistan Cricket Board boss Ramiz Raja went on his Youtube channel to praise the Indian performance.
He particularly singled out Shubman Gill for his performances. Gill slammed a double hundred in the first ODI and was compared to the Indian captain Rohit Sharma, by Raja.
“Shubman Gill looks like a mini-Rohit Sharma. He has extra time and looks good. He has enough potential. Aggression will also develop with time. He doesn’t need to change anything. He scored a double hundred recently,” said Raja.
“Batting was easy for India because they have an outstanding batter like Rohit Sharma. He plays exceedingly well. He is an amazing striker of hook-and-pull shots, so a 108-run chase becomes easy,” Raja added.
The former Pakistan player then spoke about India’s bowling and how effective they were in their role in Raipur. Raja added that the Indian bowling unit turned the game on New Zealand’s head by doing the things the Kiwis are known to do best.

Pep Guardiola threatens to leave Man City; says ‘here people don’t wait’,City’s chances to mount a title comeback in the second half of the season have gotten a lot better after the World Cup.,"Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola demanded that his team wake up and see that they are in the midst of a title race and that he wouldn’t be around if they didn’t start to challenge for the English Premier League.
City are currently five points behind Arsenal. Despite a lacklustre campaign, Guardiola’s team find them only five points behind the league leaders but Arsenal also has a game in hand, with only half of the season gone.
“I won four La Ligas in a row when I was a football player,” said the former Barcelona midfielder. “In the fifth (season) I was not the same, in the sixth I was not the same. I was not starving enough. I thought ‘How good I am’ and Madrid beat me the fifth and the sixth.
He then added, “I understand (the challenge) but I am here to do it. The chairman knows that. I want to be here, otherwise I don’t sign. But if I lose the team or I lose something I cannot be here. Here people don’t wait.”
City’s chances to mount a title comeback in the second half of the season have gotten a lot better after the World Cup. At Qatar, the Gunners lost striker Gabriel Jesus to injury. The Brazilian, signed by Arsenal from City itself, offered the North London team an added pressing threat at the key of their attack – one that had led to great dividends for a team on the up.

Australian Open 2023: Rybakina beats No. 1 Swiatek to reach quarterfinals,"Rybakina — who will face Coco Gauff or Jelena Ostapenko for a berth in the semifinals — was born in Moscow but has played for Kazakhstan since 2018, when that country offered her funding to support her tennis career.","Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina eliminated No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek in straight sets Sunday to reach the Australian Open quarterfinals for the first time.
The 22nd-seeded Rybakina used her big serving to unsettle Swiatek and got the better of their baseline exchanges to win 6-4, 6-4 in about 1 1/2 hours.
“I played well in the important moments,” said Rybakina, a 23-year-old who represents Kazakhstan. “Of course I’m nervous every time I go on the court, I think like everybody. But I’m calm, always. At least I’m trying not to show too much emotions. My coach says I actually need to show sometimes, so I’m also learning.”
Swiatek is a three-time major champion, including titles at the French Open and U.S. Open last season.
Rybakina’s ranking of No. 25 does not properly reflect her ability or results because her championship at the All England Club last July did not come with any ranking points. The WTA and ATP tours withheld all points at Wimbledon in 2022 after the All England Club barred players from Russia and Belarus from participating because of the invasion of Ukraine.

Rybakina — who will face Coco Gauff or Jelena Ostapenko for a berth in the semifinals — was born in Moscow but has played for Kazakhstan since 2018, when that country offered her funding to support her tennis career.
Despite her status as a major champion, Rybakina has been out of the spotlight: Her first-round match at Melbourne Park was placed on tiny Court 13 last Monday; her match against two-time Slam champ Garbiñe Muguruza at least year’s U.S. Open was on Court 4.
ADVERTISEMENT
But her game is worthy of much more attention, as she displayed in knocking out Swiatek at Rod Laver Arena.
Rybakina hit six aces and compiled a 24-15 edge in winners against the 21-year-old from Poland, who was a semifinalist a year ago in Australia. That followed Rybakina’s victory over 2022 runner-up Danielle Collins in the third round.

Until Sunday, Swiatek had looked fairly dominant, winning every set she contested and dropping a total of just 15 games through three matches.
She was not at her best this time, and Rybakina had a lot to do with that. In the opening game, Swiatek led 40-love but got broken. In the next, Swiatek held two break points at 15-40 but failed to convert either. So early on, while it ended up being 2-2, it very well could have been 4-0 in Swiatek’s favor.
ADVERTISEMENT
Rybakina wound up serving out that set at love, capping it with a 113 mph (183 kph) ace, and her dangerous backhand was quite a help, too: She produced six winners off that wing in the first set, compared with zero for Swiatek.
In the second set, Swiatek appeared to have gotten herself back on track, looking very much like the player who put together a 37-match winning streak last year.

"Union Berlin flying, Hertha Berlin floundering in Bundesliga",Bayern Munich stretched its lead to five points despite its drawing 1-1 in Leipzig on Friday.,"Union Berlin came from behind to beat Hoffenheim 3-1 and rose to third in the Bundesliga while city rival Hertha Berlin lost by the same score at Bochum to drop into the relegation zone on Saturday.
Forward Jordan Pefok missed an early penalty for Union when his effort crashed off the left post. Then Hoffenheim’s Ihlas Bebou, making his first appearance of the season after a knee injury, shocked the home team on a counterattack just before halftime.
Union responded with relentless pressure after the break and captain Christopher Trimmel set up defender Danilho Doekhi for two late headed goals to send the home fans wild amid flurries of snow.
Jamie Leweling really got the party going by sealing the win in injury time.
A CITY OF TWO TALES
While Union is flying, Hertha is floundering.
Former Union player Keven Schlotterbeck scored on his Bochum debut to help the home team climb out of the relegation zone at the visitor’s expense.
Hertha coach Sandro Schwarz was left shaking his head on the sideline.
“The corner statistics are symptomatic for today’s game – 6-1 for us – but the opponent used two set-pieces to score,” Schwarz said. “It was too little today.”

Both Hertha and Union have midweek games before the city derby next weekend.
FREIBURG FLOP
Freiburg slumped to a 6-0 rout at Wolfsburg to drop from second place to fourth, behind Union on goal difference.
“It’s best if I say nothing, then I can’t say anything wrong,” Freiburg coach Christian Streich said.
BAYERN BOUNCE
Saturday’s results meant Bayern Munich stretched its lead to five points despite its drawing 1-1 in Leipzig on Friday. The 10-time defending champion is assured of being first at the halfway stage, earning the unofficial title of “fall champion.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Since the introduction of three points for a win, Bayern has gone on to win the title 15 times from the 16 seasons it was leading at the halfway stage.
COLOGNE CARNIVAL
Germany forward Niclas Füllkrug scored again for Werder Bremen, taking his season tally to 11, but his team conceded seven goals at Cologne in a 7-1 loss.
The outstanding Steffen Tigges scored two and set up two more in the first half alone.
Cologne didn’t win any of its previous five league games.
SCHALKE RECORD

Eintracht Frankfurt moved to second after a 2-0 win over visiting Schalke, which remained on the bottom after just two wins all season.
Schalke’s 36th consecutive away game without a win in the Bundesliga set a new league record.
“It’s important not to stick our heads in the sand,” Schalke coach Thomas Reis said.
Bruno Labbadia’s debut in charge of Stuttgart ended in a draw against visiting Mainz 1-1.

‘From what I can see India will have three teams for three formats’: Kapil Dev,"According to Kapil Dev, India has a vast pool of talent to field three different groups for three formats.","Former India World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev said the men in blue have what it takes to win the 2023 World Cup at home. Stating that team India has a vast pool of talent to field three different groups for three formats, the legendary allrounder also said that the frequent changes in the playing eleven should be left to the wisdom of the selectors.
Speaking to Gulf News, the 64-year-old said, “I think we should leave it to the cricket board what they (selectors) plan. So many cricketers are coming, so everyone should get a chance to play. From what I can see from the outside is that they will have three teams – one each for T20Is, ODIs and Tests. That way, you can have a bigger pool.”

Watch: Lacazette hat trick puts Lyon through to Cup’s round of 16,"The hat trick was completed midway through the second half, taking Lacazette's season tally to 14 in 21 games since rejoining Lyon from Arsenal.","Alexandre Lacazette’s hat trick ensured Lyon avoided a French Cup upset by beating fifth-tier Chambery 3-0 to reach the round of 16 on Saturday.
Lyon is under pressure from its unhappy fans after poor recent performances and could ill afford to slip up at home.
Lacazette settled nerves with his first goal in the 11th minute and made it 2-0 in the 33rd, set up both times by Brazilian Teté.
The hat trick was completed midway through the second half, taking Lacazette’s season tally to 14 in 21 games since rejoining Lyon from Arsenal.
There were no upsets as Toulouse, Lorient, Reims and Angers were the other top-flight teams to go through.
Toulouse scored twice in four minutes as it beat Ajaccio 2-0 in an all-first division game. Zakaria Aboukhlal and Rafael Ratao netted midway through the second half.
Lorient won on penalty kicks at second-tier Bastia following a 1-1 draw, and Reims triumphed at fourth-tier Les Herbiers 3-0.

Angers scraped a 1-0 win at Olympique Strasbourg Koenigshoffen, which has the longest name but was the smallest team left and plays in the Alsace regional league.

"Premier League: Crystal Palace frustrates Newcastle in 0-0 draw, Villa beat Southampton",Premier League: Brighton scored two minutes from time to draw at Leicester 2-2 and maintain its assault on the English Premier League top five on Saturday.,"Premier League: Newcastle made it 15 games unbeaten in the English Premier League and moved up to third after drawing with Crystal Palace 0-0 on Saturday.
But Eddie Howe’s team missed the chance to put added pressure on Arsenal and Manchester United, who face each other at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
The result moved Newcastle level with United on points, having played a game more.
Goalkeeper Nick Pope kept his ninth straight clean sheet in all competitions.
Despite the visitors in London dominating the chances, Pope had to produce a crucial save to deny substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta what would have been a winner in the second half.
At the other end, Vicente Guaita was called into action to save from Alexander Isak and Fabian Schar.
It is the second time this week Palace has halted the momentum of one of the leading clubs after holding Manchester United to 1-1 on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
Despite another positive result for Palace, the evening was marred when Wilfried Zaha, making his 450th start, pulled up with what appeared to be a hamstring injury in the 65th minute.
Aston Villa beat PL bottom-dweller Southampton 1-0
Ollie Watkins’ second-half goal secured a 1-0 win for Aston Villa at Southampton in the English Premier League on Saturday.
Watkins’ header in the 77th minute brought an end to Southampton’s three-game winning run in all competitions and left it rooted to the bottom of the table.
The home team was twice denied goals; once in the first half when Kyle Walker-Peters was adjudged offside, and again in the second when James Ward-Prowse’s strike was ruled out because of a foul in the buildup.
ADVERTISEMENT
There was also a delay of several minutes just before halftime when all players were forced back to the locker room for safety reasons due to a drone flying over the stadium.
Southampton thought it broke the deadlock in the 25th when Walker-Peters got the final touch on a ball headed towards goal by Che Adams, only for him to be ruled offside.
Ward-Prowse’s goal was ruled out due to a foul by Mohamed Elyounoussi on Jacob Ramsey.
After surviving the two scares, Villa hit the winner when Watkins headed past Gavin Bazunu from a Douglas Luiz free kick.

The goal was also checked by VAR for a potential offside, before being allowed to stand.
Surridge seals point for Forest in 1-1 draw with Bournemouth
Sam Surridge came off the bench to score late and earn Nottingham Forest a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth in the English Premier League on Saturday.
Against his former club, Surridge equalized in the 83rd minute at Vitality Stadium after Jaidon Anthony’s first-half goal.
ADVERTISEMENT
Anthony’s finish looked set to end Bournemouth’s four-game losing streak in the top-flight and ease the pressure on coach Gary O’Neil.
But striker Surridge, who began his career with the Dorset club, poked home Brennan Johnson’s cross from close range.
The result dropped Bournemouth into the relegation zone, while O’Neil is still searching for his first win since being appointed permanent Cherries boss in November.
Forest maintained its momentum, which has seen it pick up 11 points from the last 18 available.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bournemouth had not registered a top-flight goal or point since Nov. 12 but took the lead in the 28th minute.
Burkina Faso forward Dango Ouattara, signed from French club Lorient on Thursday for around $25 million, burst away from Renan Lodi on the right then crossed for Anthony to take a touch and find the far corner past Wayne Hennessey.
Surridge ensured the points were shared after his first league goal of the season.
Late Brighton goal clinches draw at Leicester in PL
Brighton scored two minutes from time to draw at Leicester 2-2 and maintain its assault on the English Premier League top five on Saturday.

The Seagulls missed the chance to move into the top five but climbed to sixth.
Substitute Evan Ferguson headed in Pervis Estupinan’s cross in off the post for the clincher.
Harvey Barnes and Marc Albrighton scored for Leicester to cancel out Kaoru Mitoma’s sensational opener.
Neat play from Alexis Mac Allister and Adam Lallana allowed Estupinan to find Mitoma on the left. The Japan international was given plenty of time to tease Timothy Castagne, cut inside and brilliantly curl the ball into the top corner from 20 yards.

Latest Arsenal-Man United clash could herald the return of Premier League’s original rivalry,"Both clubs fell off their perch over the last decade, but Sunday’s showdown could have a major bearing on title race","There was a time not too long ago when to be an Arsenal faithful meant that you hated Manchester United, and to be a Manchester United diehard meant that you detested Arsenal. This was the Premier League’s original and genuine rivalry, pure and fierce, natural and organic, unstained by history and untroubled by the proximity of arenas, a rivalry borne out of sheer competitiveness. It was part of the package that made Premier League weekends a blockbuster in India at the turn of the century, when European football was yet to entrench into the psyche and commercial spaces of the country. Without this rivalry, perhaps league football would have never dug its roots and spread its shadows in the country.

Peak United-Arsenal encounters were a multi-layered spectacle, a one-on-one bout that unfurled multiple dimensions and narratives. The storylines were so many that it matched El Clasico, a bust-up between two legendary managers, two visionaries who lifted the standards of Premier League football, one from the shipyards of Govan and the other from the vineyards of Alsace, one who had apprenticeship as a toolmaker at a factory in Hillington, and the other with a Masters degree in Economics. No managers have defined the Premier League as much as Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger, the former farewelling his club in 2013 and latter five years later.

Why a buffet of coaching makes more sense for PV Sindhu,"In a fast developing environment where shuttlers are opening to short stints of training at various academies, Sindhu might well want to consider a spot of training with someone like Viktor Axelsen, should he be open to it.","It would have been marvellous had PV Sindhu morphed into Sung Ji Hyun’s gazelle-like court movements while relentlessly retrieving shuttles. Except, Sindhu isn’t Sung Ji Hyun, the Korean whose classical defensive style her Korean coach Park is trying to imbibe in her. Correction. She isn’t just Sung Ji Hyun. She is much more, having both achieved considerably more with two Olympic medals and five World podium finishes including the 2019 title. And blessed with more talents – her physical fortitude in terms of recovery and the natural reach which she is blessed with. As beautifully balletic as Sung Ji Hyun’s game—more the defence than attack-and Korean classicism were, SJH isn’t enough to encompass Sindhu’s inherent abilities, and to base her future course of career on.
PV Sindhu in action. (FILE)
Was there much to learn from Sung Ji? Definitely. The recent smoothness in Sindhu’s movements, her wider array of strokes, just the sheer coherence in a rally – where transitions from defence to offence and vice versa seem much more natural – make all of coach Park’s efforts worthwhile. If badminton games were jigsaw puzzles, defence was widely acknowledged as the missing—rather, jagged-edged piece needing smoothening—for Sindhu.

Courageous Vinesh at the forefront of fight against wrestling federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for alleged sexual harassment,Double World championship medallist is known to speak her mind and is considered a rebel on the circuit.,"It has been an unprecedented face-off in Indian sports – never ever had Olympic medallists made sexual harassment allegations against a federation chief, who is also a ruling party MP. Late on Friday, Round One of this battle seemed to have gone the players’ way.
India’s top grapplers called off their stir against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) on Friday following an hours-long meeting with sports minister Anurag Thakur, which ended with the government asking Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the federation’s beleaguered chief, to step aside pending inquiry. On Saturday, the Director General of Sports Authority of India (SAI) also suspended WFI’s assistant secretary Vinod Tomar because of “reports about the functioning of WFI”.

India had managed to defend 97 against Australia in a warm-up game earlier this month but the Shafali Verma-led side couldn’t repeat the feat as its opponents raced to the finish line with 37 balls to spare.

The loss has dented India’s net run rate (+1.905), which could play a vital role in deciding who qualifies for the semifinals. The Women in Blue have dropped to second place behind Australia in the Super Six Group 1.
Australia, India, South Africa and Bangladesh all have four points while Sri Lanka and UAE are on zero points.
It was a day when India’s strong batting line-up looked clueless. After conceding a couple of boundaries, Milly Illingworth (2/12) got the prized wicket of the Indian skipper as Shafali (8), once again, fell early.

Shami and Siraj are relentless with their lines and lengths: Tom Latham,Michael Bracewell had brought New Zealand back from nowhere in the first ODI but the visitors crumbled to 108 all out here on Saturday. Shami and Siraj generated prominent seam movement to run through the top-order and New Zealand could not recover from the early blow.,"New Zealand skipper Tom Latham said the relentlessness of Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj in their lines and lengths was the main cause of their second straight batting failure in the ODI series against India.
Michael Bracewell had brought New Zealand back from nowhere in the first ODI but the visitors crumbled to 108 all out here on Saturday.
Shami and Siraj generated prominent seam movement to run through the top-order and New Zealand could not recover from the early blow.
“Anytime that Siraj and Shami are in the side – they’re obviously quality bowlers and as I said they were both relentless in terms of the lines and lengths they bowled and they gave us nothing to score from.
“Fortunately for them, it was their day and unfortunately for us, we weren’t able to absorb enough pressure and put that back on them,” said Latham after the eight-wicket loss.
“When you get bowled out for just over a 100 obviously makes things pretty difficult. Unfortunately it was just one of those days where everything India did turned their way and that’s the game of cricket we play. Fingers crossed that we can turn things around in the next game.” Talking about the mindset of batters after Rohit Sharma put New Zealand in to bat, Latham said: “I think just build partnerships.
That’s something we pride ourselves on as a batting unit – building partnerships and obviously at the top, we weren’t able to do that.
“Mitch (Santner) and Michael Bracewell managed to build a little partnership, and then Glenn (Phillips) and Santner did the same but as I said when you’re bowled out for a hundred, it’s tough to come back from there,” said Latham.
Bracewell made his intentions clear despite New Zealand losing their five wickets for 15 runs. Unlike on Wednesday, he could not go on and play a big knock but his style of play left the captain impressed.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Everyone has their plans and the approach they would like to go with and obviously Brace is an attacking player. He plays at his best when he takes the game on and for him he obviously thought that was the best option in terms of how to play.
“The way he came out and the intent he showed was outstanding. So, for us, I’m sure he would have liked to go a little bit longer. But, as I said, everyone has got their own plans and the approaches they like to play with.

"Nothing to lose for New Zealand, it’s India who will be under pressure: Graham Reid","India are coming into Sunday's match after a below par 4-2 win over tournament debutants Wales, forcing them to play in the crossovers instead of a direct quarterfinals, which they would have played had they topped Pool D.","New Zealand have nothing to lose and it will be India who will be under pressure in their knock-out crossover match against the Black Sticks in the FIH Men’s World Cup, home side head coach Graham Reid said on Saturday.
India are coming into Sunday’s match after a below par 4-2 win over tournament debutants Wales, forcing them to play in the crossovers instead of a direct quarterfinals, which they would have played had they topped Pool D.
India, who finished second in the pool behind England, will face defending champions Belgium in the quarterfinals if they beat New Zealand on Sunday.
“New Zealand have nothing to lose from their point of view and pressure will be on us. I hope our team will stand up and as I said earlier, if we play our best we can beat any team in the world,” Reid said at the match eve press conference here.
“As an Australian myself, I know that New Zealand are always tough and we (India) have total respect for them. I am also confident that we will do our job (and win),” he added.
Playing at home in front of a packed stadium, India are seeking their first podium finish after the gold in the 1975 edition, but the home side is facing the pressure of expectations.
India beat New Zealand twice just a few months ago at the Kalinga Stadium in the Pro League matches and Reid is hoping that the same result will continue.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We had beaten them twice then. Moreover, our defensive unit is more settled (and better) now than that time. So, we are looking forward to the match.” Lack of finishing has been one of the main issues for India in the three pool matches.
Asked about that, Reid said, “I agree that we are lacking in finishing the opportunities we have created. But I would have been more worried had we not created opportunities. I am confident that we will be better in that aspect also.” He said it was disappointing that injured midfielder Hardik Singh was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament as he could not recover.
“But it is exciting for Raj Kumar Pal (reserve player) to come in for Hardik. He (Pal) is one of our players for the future. He is in good form. He has silky skills and has worked a lot in defence.
“Fresh legs are always important in the middle of the tournament. So, disappointing for Hardik to miss out but we have enough talent to fill up.” Captain Harmanpreet said his team will look to reduce the mistakes and work to even score from 50-50 chances.

“As a team, our endeavour should be to cut down the mistakes and convert the opportunities that came our way, even the 50-50 chances,” said Harmanpreet who scored his first goal from the penalty corner against Wales on Thursday.

Always prefer game time over practice: Shami on workload management ahead of ODI World Cup,"Earlier this month, the BCCI had announced that the National Cricket Academy will work in tandem with the IPL franchisees to monitor the fitness of the ""targeted"" players for the ODI World Cup in October-November. Shami is a key member of the squad.","The Indian cricket team has put additional focus on workload management ahead of the ODI World Cup at home but senior pacer Mohammed Shami believes there is no better way to maintain optimum fitness than playing matches regularly.
Earlier this month, the BCCI had announced that the National Cricket Academy will work in tandem with the IPL franchisees to monitor the fitness of the “targeted” players for the ODI World Cup in October-November. Shami is a key member of the squad.
“I always prefer playing matches over practice. It is always better to play maximum number of games to get ready for a big event. Load is being managed and it is being managed properly.
“I just hope the main players stay in a good zone (ahead of the World Cup),” said Shami after a match-winning spell in the second ODI against New Zealand here on Saturday.
Shami troubled the New Zealand batters with his seam movement to end with figures of three for 18 in six overs. The visitors were bowled out for 108 and India chased down the target in 20.1 overs.
Mohammed Siraj too made the ball talk. His senior partner Shami said the wicket was damp early but conditions were not overtly bowling friendly.
“It was a damp wicket, but it was important to keep good line and length. All the bowlers were disciplined and the result is for all to see.

“Conditions were not as good as it seemed. They got out early but conditions were not overtly bowler friendly. We dismissed them cheaply by bowling a testing length.” On his role as a senior bowler in the team, he said: “As far as I am concerned, I always talk to the bowler. I know he is putting in the effort but, at times, you don’t get the desired results and that can improve if you talk to your bowling partner. That is the role I like to play when I am bowling.
“My role hasn’t changed since I have come into the team (laughs). The only thing is to keep working on the fitness and diet,” said Shami.
With the series already in the bag, Shami said the team could give opportunities to uncapped Rajat Patidar and Umran Malik in the third and final ODI in Indore on Tuesday.
“The management will take a call on that but they can be given an opportunity now that the series is won,” he said.
Shami also said that it is too early to finalise the squad combination with the World Cup more than six months away.

Djokovic backs up Murray’s concerns over ‘gruelling’ schedule,"Andy Murray slammed officials as his epic five-set win over Thanasi Kokkinakis finished after 4 a.m. on Friday (1700 GMT on Thursday), well beyond the usual Grand Slam midnight madness.","Novak Djokovic said on Saturday that Australian Open organisers should take player input into account when scheduling matches, adding that late night clashes are “gruelling” for players.
Andy Murray slammed officials as his epic five-set win over Thanasi Kokkinakis finished after 4 a.m. on Friday (1700 GMT on Thursday), well beyond the usual Grand Slam midnight madness.
Following his elimination from the tournament at the hands of Roberto Bautista Agut in the third round on Saturday, the Scot again criticised the scheduling, saying, “finishing matches at 4 in the morning isn’t good for the players.”
When asked for his opinion on Murray’s comments, nine-times champion Djokovic told reporters: “I think that players’ input is always important for tournament organisation.
“We know that it’s not (decisive) because it comes down to what the TV broadcasters want to have. That’s the ultimate decision maker,” added the Serbian after his 7-6(7) 6-3 6-4 victory over Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov on Saturday.
“I would agree with his (Murray’s) points… For the crowd, it’s entertaining, it’s exciting, to have matches (end at) midnight, 1, 2, 3 am. For us, it’s really gruelling.
“Even if you go through and win, prevail in these kind of matches, you still have to come back.

“You have your sleeping cycle, rhythm disrupted completely, not enough time really to recover for another five-setter. Yeah, something needs to be addressed I guess in terms of the schedule after what we’ve seen this year.”

Liverpool and Chelsea draw 0-0 to hit Champions League hopes,A game that was short on chances and quality underlined why both teams are struggling in midtable in the Premier League and face a challenge to break into the top four.,"A season of frustration continued for Liverpool and Chelsea after a 0-0 draw at Anfield on Saturday did little to help either team’s hopes of securing Champions League qualification next season.
A game that was short on chances and quality underlined why both teams are struggling in midtable in the Premier League and face a challenge to break into the top four.
Benoit Badiashile and substitute Carney Chukwuemeka had opportunities to score in each half for Chelsea, but neither was clinical enough to make Liverpool pay.

It is now three league games without a win for Liverpool in what was Jurgen Klopp’s 1,000th game in management and his 250th in charge of the Merseyside club.
The draw at least ended a two-game losing streak for his team.
Chelsea fans got a first look at new signing Mykhailo Mudryk, who showed some promising moments when coming on as a second-half substitute.
But, like Liverpool, Graham Potter’s team will need to improve quickly if it is to rise up the table and compete to get into the top four.

I am happy with how I am going: Rohit,"However, in the second ODI against New Zealand here on Saturday the opener struck a sublime 51 off 50 balls, with seven fours and two sixes, to power India to a series-clinching eight-wicket victory.","Indian captain Rohit Sharma is not worried about the lack of big hundreds in recent times, saying he is quite content with his batting.
The scorer of three double centuries in ODIs, Rohit last made a hundred in the format way back in January 2020 as his conversation rate from fifty to a century dipped drastically.
However, in the second ODI against New Zealand here on Saturday the opener struck a sublime 51 off 50 balls, with seven fours and two sixes, to power India to a series-clinching eight-wicket victory.
“I’m trying to change my game a bit now, have been trying to take the bowlers on and I think that’s important, to try to put the pressure back. I know the big scores haven’t come, but I’m not too worried about it,” Rohit said at the presentation ceremony.
“I am happy with my batting. I have kept my approach quite similar. I am happy with how I am going. I know a big score is around the corner.” With the 50-over World Cup slated later this year at home, he said the team wants to do all sorts of things (experimentation) before entering the marquee event.
The Mohammed Shami-led attack produced an incisive effort to bowl out New Zealand for a meagre 108 before India knocked off the runs in 20.1 overs.
Shami (3/18) was well supported by Mohammed Siraj (1/10) and Hardik Pandya (2/16).
Shami and Siraj made life tough for the batters with their high-quality seam bowling, reducing New Zealand to a dismal 15 for five after Rohit opted to bowl.

“I thought these last five games, the bowlers have really stepped up. Whatever we have asked of them, they have delivered. Especially doing this in India. You can expect these performances away from India, but they have real skills.
“When we trained here yesterday in the night, it moved around, there was good carry. Which is why we wanted that challenge: 250 would have been quite challenging.
“Shami and Siraj did want to go on for longer spells, but I told them a big Test series coming up (against Australia), so we need to take care of themselves as well.” New Zealand skipper Tom Latham said the failure to build partnerships hurt his team.
“Batting up top wasn’t our finest day. India bowled right areas for a long time and pretty much gave us nothing. Not idea but full credit to India. The surface did a little bit, a bit of tennis-ball bounce, some came through, some didn’t.

“Unfortunately we were unable to build a partnership. Every time you want to put in a great performance but unfortunately we were unable to adapt quickly enough,” Latham said.
Player of the Match Shami said he always focuses on maintaining the right line and length.

Cricketer Umesh Yadav duped of Rs 44 lakh by ex-manager under pretext of buying land; cops launch probe,"A police official said a case was registered against Shailesh Thakre for cheating on a complaint lodged by Yadav, a resident of Nagpur. Thakre (37) is a resident of Koradi and a friend of Yadav.","Ace Indian pacer Umesh Yadav has been allegedly cheated of Rs 44 lakh by his friend-turned-manager under the pretext of purchasing a plot in the former’s name in Nagpur city of Maharashtra, police said on Saturday.
A police official said a case was registered against Shailesh Thakre for cheating on a complaint lodged by Yadav, a resident of Nagpur. Thakre (37) is a resident of Koradi and a friend of Yadav.
No arrest is made yet.
After Yadav was selected as a member of the Indian cricket team, he appointed his friend Thakre as his manager on July 15, 2014, as the latter was unemployed, the official said quoting the First Information Report (FIR).
“Thakre gained the trust of Yadav over time. He started handling all the financial affairs of Umesh Yadav. He used to handle Yadav’s bank account, income tax and other financial tasks,” he said.
The official said Yadav was looking for land for buying in Nagpur and asked Thakre.
“Thakre located a plot in a barren area. He told Yadav he would get it for Rs 44 lakh. Yadav deposited Rs 44 lakh in Thakre’s bank account. However, Thakre purchased the plot in his name,” he said.
When Yadav learnt about the fraud, he asked Thakre to transfer the plot in his name but the latter refused to oblige. He also refused to return the money, the official said.

"Australian Open Day 6: Novak Djokovic advances, Murray falters; Sania-Bopanna win on good day for Indians",All the notable results on day 6 of the 2023 Australian Open.,"Despite needing treatment for his hamstring twice, Novak Djokovic made light work of a tricky third-round, defeating Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (7), 6-3, 6-4.
The Serb blew a set point while serving for the first set, and saw his next two set points, which came 30 minutes after the first, saved during a lights-out first-set tiebreak. Djokovic needed to produce his best in the breaker, winning the set after multiple 20-shot rallies, and falling to the floor in exhaustion after seeing it out. From there on, he never looked back, steamrolling the Bulgarian with three breaks of serve. The hamstring is cause for concern though, as he takes on local favourite Alex de Minaur next.
Elsewhere, Andy Murray’s remarkable run at the Australian Open came to an end after another over three-hour long grind, losing 1-6, 7-6 (7), 3-6, 4-6 to veteran Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut.
The Scot looked physically shattered in the first set, and found incredible steel to come back from a break down in the second, winning a remarkable tiebreaker. Bautista Agut used his experience to elongate the rallies, and wear his physically weaker opponent down, beating the crowd and a fighting Murray to a valuable win.
In the women’s draw, heavy-hitter Aryna Sabalenka continued her incredible form in 2023, defeating Elise Mertens 6-2, 6-3 to make it nine wins in nine matches in 2023, without dropping a set. Faces a tough test against in-form Belinda Bencic next.

"Hockey World Cup: India count on counters, New Zealand on countering counters in quarterfinal playoff",Hosts’ coach calls for better goal conversion; New Zealand’ counterpart wants defensive stability.,"A tackle near the half line to steal the ball. A breezy run down the flank, into the circle. A deafening din. An attempted pass. And a goal. “That,” New Zealand captain Nic Woods says, “is India in a nutshell.”

Hardik Singh – the orchestrator of that action sequence against Spain, which saw possession exchanging sticks and turning into a goal in just eight seconds – was ruled out of the World Cup on the eve of India’s playoff match for the quarterfinals against New Zealand. But replace Hardik with Nilakanta Sharma or Manpreet Singh or Vivek Sagar Prasad, and the outcome would have probably been the same.
To paraphrase a trending meme, if you had to pick one thing that screams Indian hockey without actually saying Indian hockey, it is this – the quick turnover and the speedy counterattacks. It’s what spelt doom for Spain in the opener, put the ‘Bazball-ing’ England under the cosh in the goalless thriller and overwhelmed a defiant Wales in the concluding group stage match.
And it’s what New Zealand, a potential banana skin opponent in the knockout game, are expecting. “Their counterattack is amazing. When they are in flow, it’s hard to stop them, particularly when they are playing at home,” coach Greg Nicol said. Woods smiled: “It is a little bit daunting.” To an extent that New Zealand spent a major chunk of their last two training sessions fine-tuning their counter controls and one/two-vs-one situations.
Team’s identity
As penalty corners increasingly get blunted out by defences, turnovers in the opponent’s half have become the other lethal route to create goal-scoring chances, with teams pressing high, stealing possession and overloading in the attacking third. Watching India do that in front of packed stands is a thrill – and under Graham Reid, it’s fast becoming the team’s identity.

“Every moment on the pitch you should be trying to score,” Reid had told The Indian Express. “It perhaps is a hangover from my days (as the coach) at Australia and with Ric (Charlesworth, as an assistant coach). It makes for good watching. It’s how I love to play and my teams to play.”
New Zealand have read India’s playbook. And to counter it, they are likely to stack people in their half, block direct passing channels towards their goal, stop India from coming close to the 6m mark inside the circle and keep the scoreline as close as possible until the fourth quarter. For all the progress they’ve made, India have found the going tough against teams that adopt this style, including the Black Sticks who played two close games against India in the Pro League at the Kalinga Stadium last year.

“In the first game, we really put India under severe pressure. Went up and forced them to change what they were actually doing,” Nicol said. “So we got a few things up our sleeves, which we will bring to the party.”
Reid will hope his forward line, at least, will join the party. After an unimpressive win against Wales, Reid was at pains to explain why his team lacked the sharpness inside the attacking third. “We got in each other’s way, crowded a bit too much,” he said. “Lots of things, to be honest. Choices, decisions…”
Getting near the ‘6m ring’
He was unable to hide his frustration given these have been recurring issues. While India’s counterattacks are exhilarating, the profligacy inside the attacking third and the inability to get into scoring zones have repeatedly let them down. As per Reid’s calculations, around 70 to 80 per cent of the field goals are scored from the ‘5-6m ring around the goal.’ “Scoring zone is what you’re trying to get to and that’s tough, especially when everyone’s crowding that area,” he had said.

The team has spent months training in Bangalore for this. The purpose was to improve the quality of opportunities and make it a fun exercise. He started rating the chances created on a scale of one to five, with five for a shot from close range and one for either taking an unnecessary touch or shooting from the edge of the circle. “The target,” he said, “was to change 1s and 2s into 3, 4 and 5s.”
ADVERTISEMENT
For that, the team had to learn to be patient; roll the ball from one side of the pitch to another, find a gap and then penetrate to get into the 6m ring, an imaginary line around the goal from where most field goals are scored. It could be through the aerial balls played from the midfield to the forwards who hug the byline, weaving runs from the flanks to get behind the defenders or defence-splitting through balls, hoping to get a deflection in front of the goal.
With goals from penalty corners drying up for India, the turnovers and counterattacks are what they’ll hope will get the job done in their battle to win a spot in the last eight.
And the visitors claim to have done their homework. “We really got to be smarter on the ball, don’t give them free turnover,” Nicol said, “and when they do get turnover balls, we have to be disciplined and patient in our defence.”

"Ashwin feels India can adapt to home conditions, urges ICC for dew-free ODI World Cup","The cricket showpiece is slated in October-November this year, when dew becomes a big factor towards the evening and for the first time it will be staged completely in India across different venues.","R Ashwin feels India have quality in their rank to adapt to the home conditions during the ODI World later this year, even as the premier off-spinner urged the ICC to take corrective steps for a “dew-free” tournament.
The cricket showpiece is slated in October-November this year, when dew becomes a big factor towards the evening and for the first time it will be staged completely in India across different venues.
“There’s no point in heading in a direction and going loggerheads with conditions, because conditions cannot be challenged. You need to learn the conditions and adapt. India team has enough in their arsenal to be able to do that,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.
“However, on a given day if these conditions of dew, boundary sizes, things going here and there cannot be controlled, and that’s the only thing I believe India need to be wary of going into this World Cup… For India, in this regard,are going to be a bit short-changed because of the number of venues we play these games in.
“If they get the right conditions of cricket being competed with skill to skill, this is a team that will be very tough to beat. I certainly believe ICC should give it a thought to have a dew-free 2023 ODI World Cup,” Ashwin said, reiterating his call for an early 11.30am start.
Last week, Ashwin had mooted the idea of an early start, advancing the match by two hours to nullify the dew factor.
He had cited the example of the first ODI against Sri Lanka where India struggled in the death overs while defending a massive 374.

Sri Lanka used the conditions fully to give India a run for their money despite being 206 for 8 and went on to post 306 for 8.
Giving his logic, Ashwin said the boundaries have become shorter by about 10-12 metres to accommodate the LED advertising boards which has now replaced the vinyl sheets.
“Hyderabad can be a big venue but it isn’t because of the sponsorship LED boards. It cuts across all other venues in India, especially the older ones which were not built keeping in mind the T20 era,” he said.
“So, a 70-metre boundary in Hyderabad goes down to 58m depending on whims and fancies of that particular day.

“India’s innate strength is their quality spinners. The quality of spin might not necessarily have deteriorated. But the innate strength can sometimes get lost with the way spin is being played, and how conditions dictate the way spin is being bowled,” Ashwin said.
“I certainly believe the game has come a long way since 2011 when Dhoni lifted the World Cup in India. There has been a lot more exposure for all the foreign cricketers be it English, Australian, South African and New Zealanders. Everybody has come and played IPL and a lot of bilateral series. Their understanding of Indian conditions has definitely grown by leaps and bounds.” He, however, said he has no doubt that India would start as firm favourites in the World Cup.
“Yes, I certainly believe that India’s chance of defending the 2011 home World Cup is really high,” he said, giving stats that they have won 14 matches out of 18 in the format since the 2019 World Cup.
“India’s ODI home record ever since the 2019 World Cup finished is extremely impressive. India have won against every team that has travelled to India in this space, which are West Indies, Australia, England, South Africa, Sri Lanka,” Ashwin said.

“It’s a 78 to 80 percent win record in India. All of these 18 ODIs have happened in different venues every single time (14 venues). If you have to compare the same spree with Australia or England, the venues are pretty stock standard. They play all their Test matches at 4-5 venues, the ODIs are played in 2-3 venues and so they know their venues are the back of their hands.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ravichandran-ashwin-india-icc-2023-odi-world-cup-8396097/,sports

Is there a Netflix curse on Australian Open tennis players?,"The No. 6-seeded Auger-Aliassime, a U.S. Open semifinalist in 2021, said he wasn’t aware this was even a topic of conversation until Friday, when his girlfriend clued him in.","Tennis is abuzz with tongue-in-cheek talk about a “Netflix curse” during the Australian Open, drawing a line from the streaming service’s new docuseries about the sport to the recent rough times for Season 1 protagonists.
Of the 10 players featured prominently across the five episodes released last week, right before the start of play at Melbourne Park, only one remains in the singles competition heading into Saturday: Felix Auger-Aliassime, a 22-year-old from Canada.
The No. 6-seeded Auger-Aliassime, a U.S. Open semifinalist in 2021, said he wasn’t aware this was even a topic of conversation until Friday, when his girlfriend clued him in.
“I thought it was funny,” he said after beating 28th-seeded Francisco Cerundolo 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to reach the fourth round. “I don’t know; I don’t think it’s connected. … Maybe the players that lost, maybe they do feel like it’s connected, somehow. I don’t think they do. I don’t think it’s connected, anyhow.”
Well, of course it isn’t.
There is no such thing as a “curse” in the world of sports, although folks sure do love to concoct and discuss them. The Curse of the Bambino, for one. The Sports Illustrated cover jinx was another.
It is worth noting that no one is drawing any sort of similar silly connection between active participation in the filming of Netflix’s popular “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” — made by the same executive producers as “Break Point” — and F1’s on-track results.
Consider: Lewis Hamilton has taken part in interviews and managed to win the driver’s championship in each of the first three years of that series. Max Verstappen, meanwhile, did not sit for the Netflix cameras and collected the past two titles.

Still, just for fun, let’s run down the roster of what’s been released from “Break Point”:
— Episode 1: Nick Kyrgios (withdrew before the tournament because he needs surgery on his left knee); Thanasi Kokkinakis (lost to 35-year-old Andy Murray in the second round in a five-setter that lasted 5 hours, 45 minutes and ended at 4:05 a.m. on Friday)

"India Open: Head covered or not, Indonesian women united in their passion and craze for badminton","Some women fans wear scarves, some don’t, but it makes no difference to their love for the shuttle sport.","When Ismalinda Eriza walked into the KD Jadhav Hall for the match featuring Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo and Marcus Gideon – known around the world by their nickname, Minions – she expected at best 20 fellow Indonesian women to screech their hearts out in support. She couldn’t believe her ears when a stadium full of Indians, starting with a group of young outstation fans in Delhi for the badminton, adopted the Minions for the next 50-odd minutes, lending raucous support against a Chinese pairing, willing them onto a win almost from the jaws of defeat.
“I got goosebumps looking around and seeing all Indians get behind our boys, because they are loved so much. This was a special match,” Ismalinda said, almost tearing up and grateful for making the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex feel almost like Indonesia’s iconic Istora Senayan stadium of her teens.

‘Conveniently quiet now’: Virat Kohli slams critics after Cristiano Ronaldo’s performance against PSG,Virat Kohli credits Cristiano Ronaldo with inspiring him.,"Cristiano Ronaldo gave fans a reminder of his talent when he scored twice in a friendly on Thursday, leading a team made up of players from Al Nassr and Al Hilal against Lionel Messi’s Paris St Germain (PSG).
Ronaldo, who will makes his competitive debut for Al Nassr against Al Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League on Sunday, scored a flawless penalty and followed it up with his trademark ‘Siu’ celebration before striking again from a rebound as he ticked off a new chapter in his career a month after a disappointing World Cup campaign.
Though his side suffered a 5-4 defeat, the highly-anticipated contest offered much entertainment to fans as long-time rivals Ronaldo and Messi shared the pitch together for possibly the last time.
His performance led to Virat Kohli to pay tribute to Ronaldo on his Instagram story, while lashing out at “football experts” who have criticised Ronaldo on his performances.
“Still doing it at the highest level at 38. The football experts sitting and criticising him every week for attention are conveniently quiet now that he’s put in this kind of performance against one of the top clubs in the world. And he was apparently finished,” said Kohli, who is a big fan of Ronaldo’s work ethics and fitness regime, in his story on Instagram.
Behind every successful person, there is an inspiration and Virat Kohli credits Cristiano Ronaldo with inspiring him. An avid football fan, the Indian skipper said he draws inspiration from the Portuguese star.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-slams-cristiano-ronaldo-critics-8394589/,sports
"Australian Open Day 5: Swiatek and Rybakina, Tsitsipas and Sinner, set up highly-anticipated fourth rounds","All the notable results from day 5 of the 2023 Australian Open: Super Sunday is set at the Australian Open, as two blockbuster fourth-round encounters are confirmed.","World No. 1 Iga Swiatek continued her solid form this year, needing only 55 minutes to routinely dismantle qualifier Cristina Bucsa 6-0, 6-1. The Pole is yet to drop a set in the opening three rounds of her campaign, despite being on the tougher side of the lopsided women’s draw, which reveals itself on Sunday, as she takes on reigning Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.
Rybakina has gone significantly under the radar since her triumph in London last year, mainly due to her lower ranking. Her 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 win over last year’s finalist Danielle Collins in the third round was particularly impressive. The Kazakh flew through the first set before seeing a drop in her level in the second, the kind of lapse she can’t afford against the World No. 1.
On the men’s side, third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, one of the favourites for the title this year after so many top seeds have crashed out, continued his strong form with a third consecutive straight-sets win over Tallon Griekspoor. Up next is the much-anticipated meeting against promising Italian Jannik Sinner, who needed a huge comeback in the third round.
Sinner defeated Marton Fucsovics 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 after being outplayed for much of the first two sets. The Italian is the only men’s or women’s player to reach at least the fourth round of each of the last six Grand Slams, and that best-of-five reliability set in throughout his comeback. Both the serve and backhand were played into form at the back end of that match.
Medvedev crashes, Gauff cruises
Seventh seed and last year’s finalist Daniil Medvedev crashed out of the third round of the Australian Open against American Sebastian Korda 6-7 (7), 3-6, 6-7 (4).
Medvedev did not look settled throughout the encounter. He broke back late in the first to forge a tiebreaker, and did the same in the third, but failed to produce his best when it mattered on both occasions. His absence, along with Rafael Nadal’s early exit, leaves his quarter of the draw wide open.
In the women’s section, Coco Gauff kept her charge for a maiden Grand Slam well and truly on track by defeating Bernarda Pera 6-3, 6-2 in another impressive showing. That’s eight wins in a row in 2023, without dropping a single set.
ADVERTISEMENT
She will take on 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko next, with either Swiatek or Rybakina to follow if she wins.
Bopanna out, Jeevan-Balaji in
Rohan Bopanna, partnering Australia’s Mathew Ebden, lost his first-round men’s doubles encounter against the Austrian pairing of Alexander Erler and Lucas Miedler 6-3, 7-5.
The duo had a couple of opportunities to get back into the game in the second set, but failed to capitalise. Bopanna’s journey in Melbourne is not over yet though, as he is set to partner Sania Mirza in her last Grand Slam in the mixed doubles.
While the Indian pairing of Yuki Bhambri and Saketh Myneni, as well as Ramkumar Ramanathan, all joined Bopanna to be eliminated in the first round, the Sriram Balaji-Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan partnership, which reached the final at the ATO 250 in Pune this month, has got a place in the draw as alternates. They face fifth seeds Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek in the first round.

"Ranji Trophy: In winter, Delhi get a blanket of solace",Delhi register first outright win over Mumbai since the 1979-80 Ranji Trophy final,"For Delhi, this was a victory that came against the odds. Mumbai came to the national capital as the favourites. With Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan, Ajinkya Rahane and Arman Jaffer, they had a stronger batting unit than the hosts. The bowling led by domestic bulwarks Tushar Deshpande and Shams Mulani have more experience than Delhi’s third string. Worse, captain Yash Dhull fell unwell before the game.
But vice-captain Himmat Singh, who was dropped a couple of games ago, stepped in and led a team that had endured a tumultuous season and were out of the quarterfinal contention, to an eight-wicket win against Mumbai. It was Delhi’s first outright win over Mumbai since the 1979-80 Ranji Trophy final.

Getting more opportunities to bat in last one year has helped my power game: Santner,"Santner smashed his third ODI fifty on Wednesday while supporting a rampaging Michael Bracewell in a whirlwind 162-run stand for the seventh wicket against India, taking New Zealand very close to the finishing line in Hyderebad.","New Zealand left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner feels getting more opportunities to bat over the past 12 months has led to an improvement in his power game and helped him chip in with useful knocks.
Santner smashed his third ODI fifty on Wednesday while supporting a rampaging Michael Bracewell in a whirlwind 162-run stand for the seventh wicket against India, taking New Zealand very close to the finishing line in Hyderebad.
Batting at number eight, his game plan is simple – to hit sixes from ball one – and that was amply clear in the way he batted in the centre nets of Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Stadium on Friday.
Like the rest of the New Zealand batters, he mostly faced the spinners and tried to hit most balls out of the park. “Being an all-rounder you need to chip in both the departments. In the last year or so, getting more opportunities to bat has helped. It can be quite challenging at times if you are at the bottom and you have three or four overs left,” he said ahead of the second ODI.
“The nature of batting at 7 and 8 is that you have to go hard from ball one and hit. You train for your role and that is what I do in the nets and try to hit some sixes. When you have more time to bat like the other night you get into your innings a bit more.
“Sometime you will come with 15 overs left and sometimes with two overs left. You have to be able to do both.” Santner also gave a fitness update on leg-spinner Ish Sodhi who had a bowl in the nets. With Santner, Sodhi and off-spinner Bracewell in the squad, New Zealand have all bases “covered”.
India managed to score 349 in the first ODI but Santner feels the spinners bowled alright and it was Shubman Gill who took the game away from there.

"Australia maul South Africa 9-2, top Pool A and qualify directly for quarterfinals",Australia will face the winner of the crossover match between Malaysia and Spain in the quarterfinal match on January 24 in Bhubaneswar.,"Star forward Blake Govers scored four times, including from a penalty stroke, as title contenders Australia thrashed South Africa 9-2 to top Pool A and directly qualify for the quarterfinals of the FIH Men’s World Cup here on Friday.
Australia will face the winner of the crossover match between Malaysia and Spain in the quarterfinal match on January 24 in Bhubaneswar.
Govers struck in the fourth, 15th, 19th and 20th minutes as the rampaging Australians led 7-1 at half time. His first and fourth strikes were field goals while the second one was from a penalty corner and the third from the penalty spot.
Tom Craig (10th), Jake Harvie (22nd), Daniel Beale (28th), Jeremy Hayward (32nd) and Tim Brand (47th) were the other Australian goal getters at the Birsa Munda Stadium.
Ntuli Nqobile (8th) and Kok Tevin (58th) were the scorers — both field goals — for South Africa.
The Kookaburras slowed down a bit in the third and fourth quarters, just scoring a goal each. The fourth quarter saw both sides scoring a goal each.
Five of the Australian goals were field efforts while three were from the penalty corners. Australia earned eight PCs as against five of the South Africans.

In another Pool A match, Argentina and France scored a goal each in the final minute to play out a 5-5 draw in a dramatic contest.
Argentina finished second in the pool with five points from three matches — one win and two draws — while France ended at third with four points — one win, one draw and one loss.
Argentina will play the third place team in Pool B in their crossover match on January 22 in Bhubaneswar while France will take on the second place team in Pool B the next day.
France thought they had won the match 5-4 after Victor Charlet scored in the final minute from the penalty stroke but Argentina equalised after a few seconds through a penalty corner. Argentina earned four penalty corners in succession and scored from the last one to split points with France.

Charlet (36th, 38th, 48th and 60th) struck four goals for France with two coming from penalty strokes. His first and last were from penalty strokes while the second and third were from PCs. Tynevez Etienne scored the other goal for France in the 11th minute.
For Argentina, who had played out a 3-3 draw against pool topper Australia, Nicolas Della Torre (34th, 42nd and 60th) struck a hat-trick while Keenan Nicolas (3rd) and Martin Ferreiro (51st) were the other goal scorers.

"Federation chief’s failure is total, says French Sports Minister","Earlier this week, the Paris prosecutor's office opened an investigation into harassment against Le Graet, who has denied any wrongdoing.","The French football federation’s president Noel Le Graet, who is under legal investigation for moral and sexual harassment and stepped back amid criticism of his governance, totally failed in his duty to represent the body, the Sports Minister said on Friday.
Earlier this week, the Paris prosecutor’s office opened an investigation into harassment against Le Graet, who has denied any wrongdoing.
The 81-year-old also took a ‘step back’ as FFF chief with Philippe Diallo in charge on an interim basis, after Le Graet criticised France great Zinedine Zidane and came under fire over the extension of coach Didier Deschamps’s contract until 2026 – two years after his mandate expires.
The federation’s executive committee voted against asking Le Graet to step down after the legal investigation was opened on Monday, saying it was waiting for the conclusions of a Sports Ministry-commissioned audit at the end of the month.
“The members (of the executive committee) decided to wait for the conclusions of the audit by the General Inspectorate of Education before taking a more definitive decision on its governance,” Amelie Oudea-Castera told newspaper La Depeche du Midi.
“The conclusions will be communicated on Jan. 30. They will then have the capacity, on the basis of documents, to make their decision and take their responsibilities.
“The president has a duty of representation. And in this respect, Noel Le Graet’s failure is total.”

Perfectionist Pegula breezing through Australian Open so far,"Ah, but the No. 3-seeded Pegula is a self-described perfectionist. And so she gave herself a bit of a hard time about what happened late in the second set of her 6-0, 6-2 victory over Marta Kostyuk in the second round on Friday.","As well as Jessica Pegula is playing tennis at the moment, dropping zero sets and just 11 games total along the way to Week 2 at the Australian Open, you might think she’d be completely pleased with how things are going.
Ah, but the No. 3-seeded Pegula is a self-described perfectionist. And so she gave herself a bit of a hard time about what happened late in the second set of her 6-0, 6-2 victory over Marta Kostyuk in the second round on Friday.
“I was annoyed,” Pegula said after the 65-minute contest.
By what, exactly? Well, the 28-year-old from New York was cruising along, having won 10 of the first 11 games and serving with a 30-love lead, when she stumbled ever so slightly, ever so briefly. She missed three first serves in a row. She put a backhand into the net. She got lobbed. She double-faulted. She started muttering under her breath. She sent a backhand long to end an 11-stroke exchange. Add it up, and Pegula got broken there, her lead in the second set shrinking to 4-2. For three minutes, her play was less than ideal.
Oh, the horror.
“When I was younger, it came off as kind of a bad attitude. I’d get really negative or down on myself,” Pegula said, adding that she has worked on “not being so hard on myself during the matches.”
She reached the quarterfinals each of the past two years at Melbourne Park — she has yet to make it past that stage at a Grand Slam tournament — and to get back there, Pegula will need to defeat 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova next.
The other matchups on the top half of the women’s draw also all include at least one past major title winner: No. 1 Iga Swiatek vs. No. 9 Elena Rybakina, No. 7 Coco Gauff vs. No. 17 Jelena Ostapenko, and No. 24 Victoria Azarenka vs. either No. 6 Maria Sakkari or Zhu Lin, who were scheduled to face each other Friday night.
Pegula is hardly the only woman who has been rather dominant so far.
ADVERTISEMENT
Krejcikova, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Anhelina Kalinina, also hasn’t ceded a set and has allowed her foes to gather a combined 14 games.
Swiatek, a three-time major champion who beat qualifier Cristina Bucsa 6-0, 6-1, has won every set and lost only 15 games. Rybakina, the reigning Wimbledon champ, got past 2022 Australian Open runner-up Danielle Collins 6-2, 5-7, 6-2.
“I feel I’m more and more confident since Day 1 here. I’m not even talking about matches, but also practices,” Swiatek said. “I feel like I’ve done so much work to feel more confident, more relaxed on court.”
Gauff, an 18-year-old from Florida, advanced to a meeting against 2017 French Open winner Ostapenko by defeating Bernarda Pera 6-3, 6-2. Gauff’s opponents have collected all of 19 games through three matches.
ADVERTISEMENT
She’s also playing doubles with her pal Pegula in Melbourne — and keeping tabs on someone she could meet in the singles semifinals.
“I do watch her (matches), as a friend, I would say,” said Gauff, who lost to Swiatek in the final at Roland Garros last June. “She’s been playing well. She’s always playing well. I feel like she’s just one of those players on tour that is just consistent and plays well. I think she’s always a contender in a Slam. That’s just my personal opinion.”
A high-level showdown for the fourth round was set up in the men’s bracket: No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas vs. No. 15 Jannik Sinner. Tsitsipas, a 24-year-old from Greece who lost to Novak Djokovic in the 2021 French Open final, was one point from giving away the second set but held on there and beat Tallon Griekspoor 6-2, 7-6 (5), 6-3.
Another Sunday matchup that was set: No. 6 Felix Auger-Aliassime vs. Jiri Lehecka.
ADVERTISEMENT
No. 31 Yoshihito Nishioka was a 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-2 winner over Mackenzie McDonald, who eliminated 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal in the previous round.
Late matches Friday included No. 16 Frances Tiafoe against No. 18 Karen Khachanov, No. 7 Daniil Medvedev against No. 29 Sebastian Korda, and No. 10 Hubert Hurkacz against No. 20 Denis Shapovalov.
Sinner, a 21-year-old from Italy, erased a two-set deficit for the first time in his career and grabbed the final 12 games in a 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 victory over Marton Fucsovics.

I want Rishabh Pant sitting beside me in dugout every day of week in IPL: Ricky Ponting,"Ruled out of the IPL after surviving a horrific car accident in the last week of December, India wicketkeeper and DC skipper Pant is currently recovering after undergoing a series of surgeries in Mumbai. ","Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting wants “cultural leader” Rishabh Pant in the dugout every day of the week in the forthcoming IPL.
Ruled out of the IPL after surviving a horrific car accident in the last week of December, India wicketkeeper and DC skipper Pant is currently recovering after undergoing a series of surgeries in Mumbai.
“You can’t replace those guys, simple as that. They don’t grow on trees, players like that. We’ve got to look at – and we already are – a replacement to come into the squad, a wicketkeeper-batsman.
If he’s actually not physically fit enough to play, we’d still love to have him around,” Ponting said on the ICC Review.
“He’s the sort of cultural leader around the group, being the captain, and that attitude and infectious smile and laugh he has is what we all love so much about him.
“If he’s actually able to travel and be around the team, then I want him sitting beside me in the dugout every day of the week.
“I’ll certainly be making sure, come the middle of March when we get together in Delhi and start our camps and stuff, if he’s able to be there, then I want him around the whole time.” India are set to play Australia in a much-anticipated upcoming four-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, with the two teams also currently on track to meet again in the ICC World Test Championship final in June.

Ponting believes Pant will be a huge loss for India against Australia.
“I think he’s ranked in the top six-seven Test batsmen in the world, isn’t he?” Ponting asked (Pant is currently seventh in the ICC men’s Test batting rankings).
“When he first started, we probably all thought he was going to be a better T20 and one-day batsman than a Test batsman, but it’s actually worked the other way. His Test cricket has been remarkable.
“Even the series coming up against Australia, the four-Test series there, we know how he played against Australia in Australia last time.

“He’d have been looking forward to that series, and the rest of the world would have been looking forward to watching him play.” The 25-year-old Pant was on his way from Delhi to Roorkee when his car met with an accident on December 29.
The dashing wicketkeeper-batter was taken to a local hospital from where he was transferred to Dehradun’s Max Hospital.
Pant was then airlifted to Mumbai where he successfully underwent three surgeries performed by renowned orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala.
He is set to be out of action for more than a year.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-want-pant-sitting-beside-me-in-dugout-every-day-of-week-in-ipl-ricky-ponting-8394205/,sports
‘The media are publicly lynching me’: Novak Djokovic wants support from governing bodies after Eurosport row,"The Serb publicly called out the channel for posting a misleading video on social media that showed him ""defying"" the chair umpire.","Novak Djokovic has hit back at what he thinks is unfair treatment from the media at the Australian Open this year. Speaking about the storm that surrounded his deportation last year, the Serb said he had been painted as a “villain of the world” by the press.
After a recent row with TV channel Eurosport, Djokovic told Serbian reporters after his second-round win that he has not been supported by tennis’ organising bodies when those in the media have misrepresented and targeted him.
“Again, I am publicly asking a question: why didn’t the ATP or the Grand Slam come out and explain the situation, when they can see that the media are publicly lynching me?” he was quoted as saying by Tennis Majors.
In a social media post linking a video posted by Eurosport, Djokovic said that he had been unfairly presented to be breaking the rules and defying the umpire by taking an unsanctioned toilet break. The Serb said the video was taken out of context and the full footage would have shown him having taken permission, and the umpire only asking him to hurry back.
“I am an easy target to be the villain. That is how they portray me, for me that is now a normal occurrence – but I will not tolerate injustice,” he said. “Some things I can tolerate, some I cannot – they do not deserve for something like this to just be allowed, to get away with it.”
Djokovic revealed that the post was later taken down, and executives from the channel spoke to him, but he was not happy that a public apology was not issued. “They apologised to me privately, but people don’t know about that. I know it, and you know it – because I just told you, but the majority of people who follow tennis will never hear about it,” he added.
The 35-year-old is on the hunt for a record-extending 10th men’s singles title in Melbourne, which will equal Rafael Nadal’s all-time men’s record of 22 Grand Slams. In his way next, is 2017 semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov in the third round.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/the-media-are-publicly-lynching-me-novak-djokovic-wants-support-8394264/,sports
"Amanjot Kaur story: Carpenter father hand-crafted her first bat, now she plays for India","Taunted for choosing “boy sport”, she overcomes stereotypes and setbacks with love and support of father.","One evening when Amanjot Kaur was playing cricket in the nearby gully, with the boys in the neighbourhood, they refused to let her bat. The reason they told her: “She did not have a bat.” The real reason was different, only a few days ago had she hit a boy for boundaries, before she repeated it again. It had wound up the boys.
She returned home and instead of warmly hugging her father, a routine, she spent the evening idle. Bhupinder Singh, a carpenter, sensed something was wrong. Later, she told her about the evening, and he immediately started his scooter, went to his shop and returned late in the night with a wooden bat he himself had carved. He put the bat next to her and left home early for duty.

Dani Alves arrested in Spain after being accused of sexual abuse,"Dani Alves will now go before a judge, who will decide on the charges.","Brazilian football player Dani Alves was arrested Friday after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman in Spain.
The alleged act took place on Dec. 31 at a night club in Barcelona, police told The Associated Press.
Alves will now go before a judge, who will decide on the charges.
The charge of sexual assault in Spain can mean anything from unsolicited and unwanted sexual groping to rape. Police said they could give no detail on the case.
The 39-year-old Alves is one of soccer’s most successful players, winning major titles with several elite clubs, including Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain over his long career. He currently plays with Mexican club Pumas.

"Sun shines on Stefanos Tsitsipas, Iga Swiatek at Australian Open","Tsitsipas has still not dropped a set in the tournament as he chases his maiden Grand Slam, with his chances boosted by the exits of holder Rafa Nadal and second seed Casper Ruud and an injury cloud hanging over favourite Novak Djokovic.","Stefanos Tsitsipas and Iga Swiatek dazzled in bright sunshine to make short work of their third-round opponents on Friday as some normalcy returned to the Australian Open after scheduling woes, wild weather, upsets and late finishes hogged the headlines.
Third seed Tsitsipas, the top surviving seed in the men’s draw, checked his phone after a 6-2 7-6(5) 6-3 win over Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor and reflected on the beautiful day after hours of tennis were lost this week to the heat and stop-start rain.
“Fair crack of the whip mate, I mean, it was great,” Tsitsipas said, slipping into the local vernacular.
“I think my placement on the serve was exceptional today, I didn’t have a lot of rallies on my serve, which helped a lot.
“Kind of kept things clean and I enjoyed the weather today, what a lovely day for tennis it is today, isn’t it?”
Tsitsipas has still not dropped a set in the tournament as he chases his maiden Grand Slam, with his chances boosted by the exits of holder Rafa Nadal and second seed Casper Ruud and an injury cloud hanging over favourite Novak Djokovic.

But the 2021 French Open runner-up came close, saving a set point in the second set before doubling his advantage following a tiebreak to pave the way for a comfortable win to delight his supporters on Rod Laver Arena.

Roared on by Greek fans, many of them from Melbourne, which has the largest population of Greek speakers outside Greece and Cyprus, Tsitsipas will next take on Italian Jannik Sinner in what could be a tricky test.
Top seed and women’s favourite Swiatek was equally dominant in her 6-0 6-1 victory over Cristina Bucsa as she bids to add to her two French Open wins and U.S. Open crown.
“A couple of years ago when I was in the fourth round I was really exhausted, and right now I feel this is the right place to be,” Swiatek said.
“Hopefully I’m going to continue to playing solid and hopefully I’m going to play more matches here.”

Up next for Swiatek is Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina who battled past last year’s Melbourne Park runner-up Danielle Collins 6-2 5-7 6-2.
Jessica Pegula was also in a hurry to wrap up her match, as the third-seeded American swatted aside Marta Kostyuk 6-0 6-2 to make it seven straight victories in 2023 after a loss to Petra Kvitova in the United Cup.
Seventh seed Coco Gauff faltered on two matchpoints and then double-faulted before easing her nerves to save a breakpoint and dismiss left-hander Bernarda Pera 6-3 6-2 in a battle between Americans.
Nadal’s conqueror Mackenzie McDonald could not continue his run however, as the unseeded American fell to Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka who won 7-6(6) 6-3 6-2, though fellow Americans Sebastian Korda and Frances Tiafoe are all in action later in the day.

No male U.S. player has captured a Grand Slam title since Andy Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open, but the country’s hopes had been rekindled with eight players in the third round.

Organisers will hope the swift victories continue in the evening having defended their scheduling following a late finish to the previous day after former world number one Andy Murray beat Thanasi Kokkinakis in a five-set epic.
That match finished at 4.05 a.m. (1705 GMT on Thursday) and Murray described the late finish as a “joke.”
Tournament director Craig Tiley ruled out immediate changes after Murray said tennis must aim to avoid late finishes.
“At this point there’s no need to change the schedule,” Tiley said. “We’ll always look at it, when we do the debrief — like we do every year.

Sinner provided the drama on an otherwise smooth day, as the Italian 15th seed overcame a poor start to his encounter against Marton Fucsovics losing the first two sets before outlasting his Hungarian opponent 4-6 4-6 6-1 6-2 6-0.

Watch: Drone flown over Leicester City training session to spy on their methods,The foxes will face Brighton Hove and Albion on Saturday.,"Leicester City management was furious after a drone camera was flown over to spy on their training methods and tactics on Thursday ahead of their Premier League clash against Brighton on Saturday.
In the video available on social media and on YouTube, the security guard at the club can be seen confronting the man. The Sun quoted the club’s security officer as saying, “The man was insistent he wouldn’t leave. He filmed drills which are supposed to be kept confidential. They’re a key part of team tactics and opponents finding out about them before a game would be a huge problem.”

Speaking on his Youtube channel, Brett Lee said, “I saw India’s Arshdeep Singh completely lose it in that T20 game against Sri Lanka only a few days ago. He bowled no ball after no ball after no ball. In fact 5 no balls in that game. It would be a hard pill to swallow for him. He only bowled two overs conceding 37 runs. He was returning to the eleven after being sidelined because of an injury. He overstepped three times in a row in his second over now I know that’s not a hat trick a bowler wants to celebrate against his name.”

“You never lose this type of game with more experience,” said Conte after second-half goals Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland plus a double from Riyad Mahrez obliterated his side, who had taken the lead through Dejan Kulusevski and Emerson Royal.
“You don’t buy experience. Well… you could buy experience. But we have to buy experience step-by-step, year-by-year. We have conceded a lot of goals, it’s not good to concede four goals in one half.

Conte has also experienced personal pain lately with the death of three close friends, fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone and former players Sinisa Mihajlovic and Gianluca Vialli, although he said those losses did not impact his work as Tottenham coach.

Al Nassr vs PSG: Bruised Ronaldo scores twice to edge showdown with Messi,"By the end of the first half Ronaldo's cheekbone was bright apple red but he was all smiles after netting his second goal, smashing in a rebound when his header came back off the post. Poking his tongue out, Ronaldo wheeled away in delight and was mobbed by teammates at the corner flag.","Grimacing in pain from his bruised cheekbone, Cristiano Ronaldo steadied himself before scoring from the penalty spot for his first goal in Saudi Arabia against a Paris Saint-Germain team featuring old foe Lionel Messi.
Messi had already scored early in Thursday’s exhibition game when Ronaldo was flattened boxing-match style by PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas after about 30 minutes in Riyadh, the city which gained sporting prominence for hosting a world heavyweight championship boxing bout in 2019.
It wasn’t Anthony Joshua but Navas who caught Ronaldo flush in the face with his forearm under a high ball.
Both went down like felled boxers.

Ronaldo held his head, got back up, did a wide yawn as if to test his sore left cheek, and sent his former Real Madrid teammate Navas the wrong way.
By the end of the first half Ronaldo’s cheekbone was bright apple red but he was all smiles after netting his second goal, smashing in a rebound when his header came back off the post. Poking his tongue out, Ronaldo wheeled away in delight and was mobbed by teammates at the corner flag.
When PSG star Kylian Mbappé checked on the state of Ronaldo’s cheek just before the second half, Ronaldo milked the attention from France’s World Cup star and pointed to the red mark.
Highlights:
Mbappé smiled at him as if to say “You’ll be fine” and Ronaldo raised his arm in triumph like a heavyweight champion.

Messi’s Qatari-backed PSG won 5-4 against a combined XI of Saudi Arabian teams Al Nassr and Al Hilal, captained by Al Nassr’s new signing Ronaldo, in front of 68,000 fans at King Fahd International Stadium. Although his team lost, Ronaldo edged perhaps the final instalment of Ronaldo vs. Messi as one of the greatest rivalries in soccer history resumed in an unusual location.
Messi’s shot led to a handball and PSG’s fourth goal, scored by Mbappé from the penalty spot.
Ronaldo came off to a huge ovation just after the hour mark followed by Mbappé and Argentina’s World Cup-winning star Messi, who was warmly hugged by countryman Marcelo Gallardo, coaching the combined Saudi Arabian team.
Ronaldo’s bruise darkened with the night sky as he collected his man of the match award.

But Ronaldo was nowhere near Messi, almost like they avoided each other. They couldn’t do that earlier on the field, when Ronaldo tackled Messi in the second minute.
Moments later, Messi smiled as he scored from Neymar’s lofted pass. Ronaldo looked annoyed with his teammates for letting Messi ghost into space. Harsh, because few defenders have ever tracked Messi’s runs, let alone stopped them. The World Cup proved that, if it was ever in doubt.
There was scant interaction between former Madrid star Ronaldo and Messi, his arch rival during Barcelona’s glory days.

It was Ronaldo who tentatively approached an impassive-looking Messi at the center circle seconds before the whistle blew to start perhaps their final game as opponents.
There was a polite exchange, the briefest handshake.
Messi stared at Ronaldo late in the first half, after PSG defender Juan Bernat had been sent off, and Ronaldo seemed to look away from Messi.

It was a different mood in the tunnel beforehand, when a grinning Ronaldo hugged Ramos, who now plays alongside Messi, and joked with Ramos that he’d forgotten to remove an ear stud.
The laugh was on Ramos later, when he air-kicked a loose ball on Ronaldo’s second goal. PSG’s Neymar also missed, from the penalty spot.

The atmosphere built before the start as fans waved Argentina flags while others held up the yellow jersey of Al Nassr, pointing proudly to Ronaldo’s No. 7 on the back. The ticker tape poured from the stands as Ronaldo led his team out. He smiled and winked when he got a loud ovation.
Ronaldo could end his storied career in Riyadh after signing a deal worth a reported $200 million a year, swapping Europe’s elite club competition for the Asian Champions League.
He makes his Saudi league debut for Al Nassr on Sunday against Ettifaq, far from the fields where he shone for Manchester United and Madrid.
INTENSE RIVALRY
The Messi-Ronaldo rivalry has been among the greatest ever.
Between them they have 12 Ballon d’Or awards — Messi a record seven, Ronaldo five — and have won a combined 56 major trophies. Ronaldo won the Champions League five times, compared to Messi’s four. Messi is the all-time “El Clasico” top scorer with 26 goals for Barca, eight more than Ronaldo for Madrid.

Ronaldo won the European Championship in 2016 but Messi was brilliant in Argentina’s Copa America win in 2021 and its 2022 World Cup success.
Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer in men’s international soccer with 118 goals, while Messi’s seven at the World Cup took him to third overall with 98.

It was after the young wrestlers told her about their plan to boycott the camp — and even quit the sport — that Vinesh decided to go public Wednesday with allegations of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, and other national coaches.

"This was not our best performance, admits India captain Harmanpreet Singh",India can still qualify for the quarterfinals if they beat New Zealand in their crossover match on Sunday. ,"India captain Harmanpreet Singh on Thursday admitted that they were below par and could have done much better as the home team defeated a lowly Wales 4-2 to fail to top its pool and qualify directly for the quarterfinals of the FIH Men’s World Cup.
India can still qualify for the quarterfinals if they beat New Zealand in their crossover match on Sunday.
“We are not satisfied with this win. This was not our best performance and we could have done better,” Harmanpreet said at the post-match press conference.
Needing to win by a margin of eight goals to directly qualify for the quarterfinals, India failed to live up to the expectations as they finished second in Pool D behind England.
Both India and England ended their group engagements on seven points each after winning two matches and drawing one but the European side topped Pool D on the basis of superior goal difference.
England, who had outclassed Spain 4-0 in the earlier Pool D match here, have a better goal difference of plus nine as against India’s four.
When two teams are on same points and won equal number of matches, the ranking is decided by goal difference.

“We created chances but somehow we could not score too many goals. We hope to do better against New Zealand,” the captain, who scored his first goal from a penalty corner, added.
Head coach Graham Reid rued the lack of finishing by the forwards, which continued from their drawn match against England on January 15.
“We played well in patches and Wales defended well. They (Wales) are a good team and if you give chances to them, they will score. England had also made our job tougher,” Reid said, as England’s 4-0 win over Spain put India under pressure.
“I thought we still made a lot of chances but the finishing was still lacking which was the most disappointing part. Wales defended well. There is no easy way to gold medal in this World Cup and every team is different. There were positives we can take from today’s match.” The Australian said New Zealand will not be easy opponents in the crossover match as India had found out in the two FIH Pro League matches here last year.

“The first match (of Pro League) was a tough one while the second one was a bit easier. New Zealand will not be easy opponents,” Reid said.
India had beaten New Zealand 4-3 in the first match and 7-4 in the reverse game of the Pro League on October 28 and November 4 last year respectively.
On Hardik Singh, who missed Thursday’s match due to a hamstring injury, Reid said, “We will take a decision on January 21 whether he will stay or not. He is improving day by day so fingers crossed.
“But having a player less today was not the issue, we played with 16 players in Tokyo Olympics.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/hockey/hockey-world-cup-india-vs-wales-not-our-best-harmanpreet-8392834/,sports
Andy Murray grinds down Kokkinakis in late-night epic,Murray's resistance looked over when Kokkinakis led 5-2 in the third set with the Australian on the verge of his biggest career win. But Murray would not go away.,"Former world number one Andy Murray produced one of his greatest ever comebacks to sink home hope Thanasi Kokkinakis in a titanic second-round thriller at the Australian Open in the early hours of Friday morning.
The 35-year-old Scot looked down and out against an inspired Kokkinakis as he trailed by two sets and 2-5 but displayed his trademark warrior spirit to somehow claw out a 4-6 6-7(4) 7-6(5) 6-3 7-5 victory after five hours and 45 minutes.
When Murray finally got the job done in what was his 250th Grand Slam match, the clock was just past 4.05am local time but a sizeable and vociferous crowd had remained glued to their seats inside the Margaret Court Arena.
It was another stupendous effort from the three-time Grand Slam champion whose career has been littered by such battles and who has stubbornly refused to call it a day since having a partly metal hip inserted in 2019.
Bizarrely he will now play Roberto Bautista Agut, the man who beat him at the 2019 Australian Open, after which Murray’s career appeared to be over because of the hip condition.
While it felt absurd to have elite sport going on at such an hour, Murray simply did not care as he showed again his insatiable appetite for a scrap.
The 26-year-old Kokkinakis, whose own career has been too often blighted by injuries, dominated the opening two sets with the kind of aggressive tennis and ball-striking that made a mockery of his world ranking of 159.

Murray’s resistance looked over when Kokkinakis led 5-2 in the third set with the Australian on the verge of his biggest career win. But Murray would not go away.
Kokkinakis got tight with the finishing line in sight and the venom gradually went out of his shots as Murray threw caution to the wind and locked on to his target. Relentlessly Murray ground his way back into the contest to set up a deciding fifth set, sealing the fourth set with a second-serve ace.
A weary-looking Kokkinakis did not capitulate and the raucous atmosphere inside the stadium revived him early in set five as he kept his nose in front on serve. There was pandemonium when he saved four break points at 3-3 and Kokkinakis was within two points of victory when Murray served at 4-5 in the decider.
But Murray’s greater experience of such duels enabled him to get the crucial break of serve in the following game with a stunning forehand winner before sealing victory in the next game on his first match point with a backhand winner.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/andy-murray-grinds-down-kokkinakis-in-late-night-epic-8392789/,sports
"Former Tottenham player Anton Walkes, 25, dies in Florida boat crash","Walkes began his career with English Premier League club Tottenham and also played for Portsmouth before signing with Atlanta United in the MLS, where he spent three seasons.","Professional football player Anton Walkes has died from injuries he sustained in a boat crash off the coast of Miami, authorities said Thursday.
Walkes, who was 25, was found unconscious and taken to a hospital after the crash between two boats Wednesday near the Miami Marine Stadium basin, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Walkes was operating one of the boats that crashed, the state agency said in a statement.
It was unclear whether anyone else was injured. The agency’s investigation is ongoing.
Walkes, a defender, was entering his second season with MLS club Charlotte FC. The team had arrived in Fort Lauderdale on Jan. 9 for its first leg of preseason training and had a friendly scheduled with St. Louis on Saturday. That match has been cancelled.
Charlotte FC owner David Tepper said all at the club were “devastated by the tragic passing of Anton Walkes.”
“He was a tremendous son, father, partner and teammate whose joyous approach to life touched everyone he met,” Tepper said in a club statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Walkes joined Charlotte for the club’s debut MLS season in 2022. He played in 23 matches with 21 starts and had five shots on goal this past season.
“Anton made those around him better people in all areas of life and represented Charlotte FC to the highest standard both on and off the pitch,” Tepper said.
Fans began laying flowers outside of the east gate of Charlotte’s Bank of America Stadium on Thursday.
Walkes began his career with English Premier League club Tottenham and also played for Portsmouth before signing with Atlanta United in the MLS, where he spent three seasons.

The MLS released a statement saying “there are no words to describe the sorrow of everyone in Major League Soccer today.”
“Anton was a talented and dedicated player who was loved by his teammates and fans,” the statement said.
In 2016, a boat crash off Miami Beach killed Major League Baseball player Jose Fernandez, a star pitcher for the Miami Marlins. Fernandez and two other people died when their 32-foot vessel slammed into a jetty, according to authorities.
Charlotte FC teammate Jaylin Lindsey said he was “heartbroken” to learn of Walkes’ death.

“Fly high my brother, you’re the best teammate I could’ve asked for,” Lindsey Tweeted. “Love you man.”
Tottenham Hotspur also tweeted: “We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of former player, Anton Walkes.

Winter of discontent continues for India’s shuttlers as Lakshya Sen surrenders crown and Saina Nehwal crashes out meekly,The defending champion lost his fabled composure and patience in a broken game against Gemke.,"Lakshya Sen believed the shuttle clipped Rasmus Gemke’s shirt before it went out and the score turned 10-14 in the second set. It scrambled his composure so bad—neither confidence of clear winners in taking the first 21-16, nor his rearguard in the third, making up a 1-8 deficit to reach 13-14, could give him the assuredness that he could win Round Two against the Dane.
It handed the talented Indian a bitter defeat during his title defence, and an experience in follies of impatience, one he’ll struggle to forget going forward. Line calls and umpire judgments go wrong all the time, net-chords tumble the wrong way cruelly too. But Sen allowing the frustration of a deepening points-gap – after pocketing the first – to boil over and wreck his composure was the kind of second season blues that sully entire matches.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/lakshya-sen-surrenders-crown-saina-nehwal-crashes-out-india-open-2023-8392710/,sports

The vendors who were selling popcorn and fries for Rs 100 were now beginning to offer it half the price as the match seemed to head for an early ending. Little did they know, Michael Bracewell will once again make the fans grab popcorn and be glued to the seats as he threatened to take down India’s 350-run target.
Bracewell had walked in with New Zealand five down for 110 in the 25th over and when he was joined by Santner, the required run-rate had escalated to 10.42. But Bracewell not only found a way to take the game deep, but nearly came within a couple of sixes to breach India’s total.

"Djokovic bothered by leg, heckler during Australian Open win","Seeking a 10th trophy at Melbourne Park, to add to his own record, and a 22nd Grand Slam title overall, to equal Nadal's, Djokovic put everything aside and beat 191st-ranked French qualifier Enzo Couacaud 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-0.","Novak Djokovic propped up his left shoe on a courtside sign so he could stretch out his bothersome hamstring. He grimaced while flexing the muscle after one point, hopped on his right leg to keep weight off the left. He took a medical timeout while a trainer re-taped him during the second set — which Djokovic would go on to drop.
As if he needed another distraction, Djokovic was flustered enough by a heckler that he asked chair umpire Fergus Murphy to have the spectator removed from Rod Laver Arena, saying: “The guy’s drunk out of his mind. He’s been provoking. He just wants to get in my head.” As Djokovic summed up: “It was a lot happening tonight.” Here’s what did not happen Thursday evening at the Australian Open: Djokovic did not lose his way entirely and, most importantly, he did not lose in the second round, which is what happened to both No. 1 seed Rafael Nadal and No. 2 seed Casper Ruud.

It was Djokovic’s 23rd consecutive win at the Australian Open, a streak that paused a year ago when he couldn’t play in the tournament because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.
This did not shape up as a contest of much intrigue, given that the fourth-seeded Djokovic has done all that he has done, while Couacaud entered with a career mark of 2-5. And whatever Couacaud’s chances were beforehand seemed to dim just four games in, when he turned his right ankle and required a visit from a trainer.
But Couacaud overcame that and played freely, conjuring some terrific shot-making and even having some fun, celebrating his claim of the second set by pointing to the court as if to indicate, “This is my house!” Which, of course, it is not.

Not having practice and tour games could hurt Australia in India: Healy,"The touring side under Pat Cummins is not scheduled to play any tour games in between Tests, and Healy thinks that could hurt Australia's chances in the crucial series. ","Former Australia wicket-keeper Ian Healy doesn’t agree with prolific run-getter Usman Khawaja’s opinion that practice matches are not required ahead of the four-Test Border-Gavaskar series in India beginning February 9.
Australia will not be playing a single practice game in India before the opening Test in Nagpur, and Khawaja, a member of the touring side, recently said it won’t harm the team’s chances on spinning sub-continent wickets.
“Have you ever been pre-tour with us? They can be spinning wickets when we play but we go to the practice matches and they are green Gabba-like wickets out there so what’s the point,” Khawaja was quoted as saying recently by the Australian media.
“I think we have finally learned. When I heard we weren’t going to have a practice game I went up to (head coach) Andrew McDonald and said, ‘good idea’.” Healy, 58, on Thursday begs to differ and said that while someone like Khawaja, who is in peak form, might not require fine-tuning on Indian pitches, there would be many in the side who need to get used to sub-continent wickets.
“That’s an in-form natural batsman (Khawaja) talking,” Healy told SEN Radio on Thursday.
“I think the spinners would like a ‘bowl-off’ into it and so the non-natural players who need some repetition and to grind before getting back into it. It’s not for everyone practice matches, but it is for some,” added Healy.
The touring side under Pat Cummins is not scheduled to play any tour games in between Tests, and Healy thinks that could hurt Australia’s chances in the crucial series.

“How do we get players back into form? There’ll be no games in between the four Tests either. Someone who is going to be sitting on the bench for three matches might get dragged in, we’ve got to be careful.” The veteran of 119 Tests and 168 ODIs added that he was concerned for someone like pacer Lance Morris, who could make his debut for Australia on the tour.
“I am a little bit worried, not so much for an Usman (Khawaja) and that sort of personality that he’s got with great natural flair. But a Lance Morris, I want to keep him revving, I would be looking to find games for a few of those (players).
“We want them to play games, see if there’s a club game if there is such a thing in India. I don’t need him (Morris) getting stale or bored without form behind him,” opined Healy.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/not-having-practice-and-tour-games-could-hurt-australia-in-india-healy-8392161/,sports
India extends USD 40 million for bolstering sports infrastructure in Maldives: EAM Jaishankar,"New Delhi's cooperation in the areas of sports and youth development has expanded rapidly, through the gifting of equipment and training of Maldivian athletes in India, Jaishankar said. ","External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday said India has extended a concessional USD 40 million Line of Credit for developing sporting infrastructure in the Maldives, as part of New Delhi’s efforts to bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship projects such as “Fit India” and “Khelo India” into the ambit of the Neighbourhood First Policy.
Jaishankar is on a three-day visit to the Maldives and Sri Lanka to further expand bilateral engagement with the two key maritime neighbours of India.
He made these comments during the inauguration of a community project in Shaviyani Foakaidhoo.
“Sports infrastructure across islands will be developed through the dedicated concessional USD 40 million Line of Credit. I should add here that in India, we have two movements which the Prime Minister has personally propagated. One is called Fit India, to encourage all of us to be fit and the other is called Khelo India for the young people to take part in sports,” Jaishankar said during the inauguration.
“For me today, this is a way of taking Fit India and Khelo India into our Neighbourhood First Policy and we certainly would like to see a much more socially active, physically active South Asia,” he said.
Fit India and Khelo India were introduced by the Modi government to revive sporting and fitness culture at the grass root level in the country.
Jaishankar inaugurated the community centre with his Maldivian counterpart Abdulla Shahid.

The community centre in Shaviyani Foakaidhoo is part of 45 high-impact projects that New Delhi is partnering with the Maldives government, of which 23 have been completed. Foakaidhoo is one of the inhabited islands of the Shaviyani Atoll administrative division and is geographically part of the Miladhummadulhu Atoll in the Maldives.
New Delhi’s cooperation in the areas of sports and youth development has expanded rapidly, through the gifting of equipment and training of Maldivian athletes in India, Jaishankar said.
“We have undertaken grant projects for setting up youth centres, strengthening sports infrastructure and establishing open-air gyms on 64 islands, including in Foakaidhoo,” he said.
“This community centre is an excellent example of the quality social infrastructure that is being created across the Maldives under the India-Maldives development partnership. I applaud the council and the people of Foakaidhoo for the successful completion of this project,” Jaishankar stressed.

A new project for the development of a sports complex in Gaaf Dhaalu Gaddhoo was added on Wednesday, the External Affairs Minister said.
“I am happy to share that, earlier today, we have agreed to extend a further MVR 100 million as grant to the Maldives to undertake more projects towards the creation of local island infrastructure and socio-economic development of island communities,” he said.

‘This is a protest to save the future of the sport and the future of women wrestlers. This is not about politics’: Bajrang Punia,"The hundreds of wrestlers present also included, Tokyo Olympic silver medalist and junior World medalist Deepak Punia and Anshu Malik joining the protests.","“This is a protest to save the future of the sport and the future of women wrestlers. This is not about politics,” said Bajrang Punia on Thursday, making it clear time and again alongside the other wrestlers present that no politician will be asked or allowed to speak at the protest.
Hundreds of wrestlers including Chhatrasal trainee and Tokyo Olympics silver medalist wrestler Ravi Dahiya joined in the protest against the Wrestling Federation of India at Jantar Mantar. Tokyo Olympic silver medalist and junior World medalist Deepak Punia and Anshu Malik were also present. This, a day after Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik accused BJP MP and Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh of sexual harassment.
2014 Commonwealth Games gold medalist and BJP leader Babita Phogat on Thursday assured the wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar against the Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, that their issues will be resolved. “I have assured them that the government is with them. I will try that their issues are resolved today,” said Phogat while talking to media after meeting the wrestlers.

Singh, however, denied all the allegations on Wednesday, saying if charges are proven true he can be hanged. “Is anyone saying that the WFI has sexually harassed a wrestler? Only Vinesh has said it.

"A late entrant to international cricket, another product from Bracewell family making up for lost time","Having made his international debut in March last year, 10 years after his maiden first-class appearance, Michael is surely making the opportunity count. In only his fourth ODI, he had smashed an unbeaten 127 against Ireland to chase down 301 after New Zealand lost six wickets for 153 runs.","Cricket runs in the family for late bloomer Michael and he is making the Bracewells proud.
After his jaw-dropping 140 off 78 balls in the first ODI against India on Wednesday, the 31-year-old New Zealander has made a strong case to be rated as the most feared number seven batter in the world.
Chasing 350, his team was down and out at 131 for six but Michael stayed in the moment and slayed the Indian attack to all parts of the ground to single-handedly take his team on the brink of an improbable win before falling just 12 runs short.
Such was his zone that he picked a spot and the ball followed, whether it was an audacious scoop off Mohammed Shami or an outrageous driver over cover off Kuldeep Yadav. Overall, as many as 10 sixes came from his blade.
Having made his international debut in March last year, 10 years after his maiden first-class appearance, Michael is surely making the opportunity count. It wasn’t the first time he found himself in a hopeless situation. In only his fourth ODI, he had smashed an unbeaten 127 against Ireland to chase down 301 after New Zealand lost six wickets for 153 runs.
100! @braceyourself10 that is special. Brings up his 2nd ODI 100 in just 57 balls. His partnership with Mitchell Santner now worth over 130 runs. 43 overs gone 274/6 chasing 350 in Hyderabad.

He could not get his team over the line on Wednesday but won a lot of fans for his fearless display. His family, which includes three Test cricketers in John Bracewell (uncle), Brendon Bracewell (uncle) and Doug Bracewell (cousin), must be proud too. His father Mark, his coach since childhood, played first-class cricket in New Zealand.
Speaking after his epic innings, Bracewell said years spent in domestic cricket is helping him massively at the highest level.
“I would say most international cricketers are pretty motivated but the benefit that I have is that I was able to get experience in domestic cricket and understand the way that I want to play.

“I came into international cricket sort of knowing this is how I am successful domestically and I am going to try and emulate that in international cricket.
“So far, there have been some patchy moments but when it comes off it feels pretty good. Unfortunately, could not get the team over the line tonight,” said Michael after the game.
Michael shared a record 162-run stand with Mitchell Santner to take the game down to the wire. When he came into the crease in 29th over, New Zealand needed as many as 219 runs. However, he feels the dire situation worked in his favour.
“I think you are just trying to win the game of cricket really. It is just about coming in and trying to do your role. It sort of takes the pressure off when you are losing so many wickets. You just try and rebuild and not get too far ahead of yourself,” he said when asked about his mindset while batting alongside Santer.

“It is one of those things once you get over the line you start believing you can do it again. We watched Shubman bat for 50 overs and saw that it was a pretty good wicket. You could play your shots, especially down the ground looked pretty small straights.
“We were just talking about to give ourselves a chance and take the game deep. We did not really talk too much about winning the game at that stage but if you are able to do the ground work early you give yourself a chance at the back end. We were able to get close but unfortunately wasn’t enough.” Besides a 100 first class games, Michael, who also has been effective with his off spin, has played a lot of T20 cricket in New Zealand. So, it wasn’t a surprise that he played an ODI innings in T20 style.
“T20 has been a huge influence on one day cricket and that is what makes one day cricket so exciting. You can be in a position like we were in and you can still work your way up to a position of power. I don’t think we got ourselves to a position of power but we got ourselves in a position where we could have won the game.
“The skills that players are learning in T20 cricket are hugely beneficial for the one day game,” he reckoned.

Talking about cricketing tradition in the family, Michael said he is spoilt for choice when it comes taking advice but values his father’s opinion the most.

"Rafael Nadal could be out for 6-8 weeks, confirms grade 2 muscle tear in his left leg",The Spaniard was a set and break down during his second-round defeat to Mackenzie McDonald at the 2023 Australian Open when he crouched down in pain clutching his hip.,"Rafael Nadal may spend 6-8 weeks out of competitive action again, after suffering a Grade 2 tear in the iliopsoas muscle in his left leg.
Confirming the injury, Nadal took to Twitter on Thursday and wrote, “Good afternoon. I have carried out medical tests after the defeat yesterday. The MRI shows a grade 2 lesion in the Iliacus Psoas of his left leg. Now it’s sports rest and anti-inflammatory physiotherapy. Normal recovery time 6 to 8 weeks.”
The Spaniard was a set and break down during his second-round defeat to Mackenzie McDonald at the 2023 Australian Open when he crouched down in pain clutching his hip. A lengthy match timeout for treatment, and a laboured performance to get past the finish line, were both indicative that the injury he suffered was serious. In his post-match press conference he confirmed the pain was in his hip, but he was unsure of the extent of the injury.

Nadal, alongside his doctor Angel Ruiz Cotorro, stayed back in Melbourne to get medical tests that revealed it was not an impact injury or a joint issue, but actually, a muscle tear, for which rehabilitation and recovery tend to take a longer, more complicated time.
The Grade 2 tear comes in his in the iliopsoas muscle of his left leg, which joins the abdomen to the thigh. It is a flexor muscle for the hip, confirming Nadal’s suspicion during the match. The Spaniard felt his movement in his hip, especially during his backhand motion, was severely restricted ever since he went down in the second set.

Novak Djokovic slams TV channel for ‘judgemental’ and ‘wrong’ social media post,"The video, posted as an Instagram reel, shows a conversation between Djokovic and the chair umpire during his first round clash against Roberto Carballes Baena at the Australian Open.","Novak Djokovic took issue with a social media post by TV channel Eurosport on Thursday, saying they did not get their information right in a post that was “judgemental and wrong.”
The video, posted as an Instagram reel, shows a conversation between Djokovic and the chair umpire during his first round clash against Roberto Carballes Baena at the Australian Open.
Djokovic tells the umpire he needs to rush to use the washroom, and walks off as the umpire tries to call his name. He rushes back just in time as the umpire calls time, to avoid a time penalty, since the break was not his designated toilet break. The caption read: “Novak Djokovic defied the umpire to take an early bathroom break in his first match at the Australian Open”.
Djokovic issued a detailed clarification on his Instagram story, saying that he took permission from the umpire who told him to hurry back, and that, in footage omitted by the channel, she was only calling his name to let him know that the players’ washroom is on the other side of the court.
“I didn’t “defy” her or the rules. She gave me permission and told me to be quick,” he wrote. “Next time be mindful about what you post. You have a responsibility towards many sports fans that follow your page.”

Argentine farmer grows 124-acre image of Lionel Messi to celebrate World Cup triumph,The field in Los Condores in central Cordoba province was sown using an algorithm that calculated where seeds would need to be planted so that when the corn grew it created a huge visual image of Messi's bearded visage,"In a distinct way of celebrating country’s FIFA World Cup win, an Argentine farmer has grown a 124-acre image of Lionel Messi who took the team to historic win over France in last month’s world cup in Qatar.
The field in Los Condores in central Cordoba province was sown using an algorithm that calculated where seeds would need to be planted so that when the corn grew it created a huge visual image of Messi’s bearded visage, news agency Reuters reported.
The soccer-mad South American country is a major agricultural producer, the third largest global exporter of corn. Farming is its main export driver, though football may be its top claim to fame.
The Sportbible reported that farmer Maximiliano Spinazze decided to grow an image of Messi by planting a specially designed cornfield. Spinazze used an algorithm which calculated where seeds would need to be planted in his field in Los Condores, which is in the central Cordoba province of Argentina. As a result, a huge picture of Messi’s face appeared and it is reportedly visible from space.
Sportbible also quoted Spinazze as saying, “Now they are world champions, I am delighted this can be expressed by planting the crop.”
While Carlos Faricelli, the farming engineer who designed the coding for the machines sowing the seeds that made Messi’s face appear on the field explained the procedure also explained, “I had the idea to make a code that goes in the seeders with Messi’s face as a tribute.”

"Saudi Arabia set to profit from Ronaldo move, says football finance expert","The 37-year-old forward's contract with Al Nassr is estimated by the media to be worth more than 200 million euros ($215.76 million) and the deal has drawn a huge amount of attention which is likely to offer monetary opportunities, Joyce said.","Cristiano Ronaldo’s move to Al Nassr could lead to a financial windfall for his new club and Saudi Arabia, football finance expert Neil Joyce told Reuters, as the Portugal international gears up for his first game in the country since the deal was announced.
Ronaldo was named captain of Riyadh ST XI — a team made up of Al Nassr and Al Hilal players — for an exhibition match on Thursday against Lionel Messi’s Paris St Germain.
The 37-year-old forward’s contract with Al Nassr is estimated by the media to be worth more than 200 million euros ($215.76 million) and the deal has drawn a huge amount of attention which is likely to offer monetary opportunities, Joyce said.
Ronaldo will have to wait until January 21 before he can make his debut for Al Nassr due to him currently serving suspension because of the time he smashed an Everton fan’s phone out of their hand whilst leaving the pitch at Goodison Park in November. (Twitter/Cristiano Ronaldo)
“It’s well-publicised the growth of the Al Nassr fanbase after Ronaldo joined, they went from under a million fans to like eight million in a space of like 10 days,” said Joyce, who is CEO & co-founder of CLV Group and advises clubs on how best to maximise their revenues through engagement with their global fanbases.
“There are monetary opportunities for them. For sponsorship, suddenly showing the global brands that you can reach eight million fans, there’s some monetization that they could benefit from straight away on it.
“He’s got a heavy following around celebrities, TV, entertainment and pop music, so, there are content opportunities for Saudi Arabia to almost be a hub for TV and entertainment. Also to promote the country as a destination.”
According to Joyce, Ronaldo’s move to Saudi Arabia would also set a precedent for more big-name players to arrive and develop the Saudi league in the same way to Pele’s impact on US Soccer after he joined New York Cosmos in 1975.

“It’s more of a short-term hit that they can get with him. But also, if they want to become the next version of the MLS (Major League Soccer). Think back to Pele,” Joyce added.

“The Ronaldo effect could take hold in that area and, given the success of the World Cup in that region, I think it makes a lot of sense for Ronaldo and the value that it can bring in the not-too-distant future.
“You’re going to see a series of relatively high-profile stars that maybe are entering the latter stages of their career, probably moving over to Saudi Arabia.”

‘I never saw we really went for the second goal’: Ten Hag rues dropped points as United lack ruthless edge,Dutchman Ten Hag was on the cusp of becoming the first Manchester United manager since the great Alex Ferguson in 2009 to win 10 successive games as his side led 1-0 at Selhurst Park in the 91st minute.,"The look of disbelief on Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag’s face when Crystal Palace’s Michael Olise curled a stoppage-time free kick into the net said it all on Wednesday.
Dutchman Ten Hag was on the cusp of becoming the first Manchester United manager since the great Alex Ferguson in 2009 to win 10 successive games as his side led 1-0 at Selhurst Park in the 91st minute.
Another couple of minutes and United would have gone second in the Premier League, six points behind Arsenal ahead of Sunday’s showdown with the leaders.

But then Olise cooled the title talk with a magical free kick that left David De Gea clawing at thin air and United paying the price for a lack of killer instinct.
United will feel short-changed having controlled large swathes of the game, although Ten Hag said they had themselves to blame for not being hungry enough to add to the lead given to them by Bruno Fernandes late in the first half.
“We have to invest more to get that second goal and then not be in that situation that a lucky moment costs you two points,” Ten Hag told the BBC. “We were 1-0 up. In the second half we had a lot of space to kill them and go for the second.
“I never saw we really went for the second goal.”

To add to United’s woes they had a justifiable penalty claim turned away and, more damagingly, influential Brazilian midfielder Casemiro was booked late on for a rash challenge and he will now be suspended for the trip to Arsenal.
“He’s a really important player for us and a reason we’re in this position,” Ten Hag said.
“But last time we beat Arsenal without Casemiro. We need to do it again.”
Despite the disappointment, United’s run of form has lifted them to a position few imagined was possible earlier this season and Ten Hag said the focus was now on Arsenal.

“It happened. You can’t change it. We’re looking to Arsenal and to make a proper plan. The players have to make sure they’re ready. It’s fantastic to play such games.”
While Ten Hag tried to play down the loss of Casemiro for Sunday’s clash, keeper David De Gea admitted it was a bitter blow and he also questioned why United were playing in midweek.
“Big blow to lose Casemiro for Sunday. I don’t get it why Arsenal don’t play as we have to play in the same week and they don’t,” he said. “Now we are missing one of our best players.
“I don’t understand. Now we miss him for a big game and it is a big loss for us.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/i-never-saw-we-really-went-for-the-second-goal-ten-hag-rues-dropped-points-as-united-lack-ruthless-edge-8390772/,sports
