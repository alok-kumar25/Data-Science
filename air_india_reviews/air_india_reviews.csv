Air India booked me on air India flight leaving next day at 5 AM to Amritsar. I could not handle a wait at DEL air port 15 hrs. 
I took a tax to my location in Punjab - took 8 hrs to my hotel and taxi cost me 12,000 rupees.
 
Nightmare  continue on my return flight - Took AI 480 from Amritsar to Del - 2300 - AI agent informed me at Amritsar gate , that MY connecting flight at AI 187 -26th Mar-2024, DEL  to YYZ Toronto has been delayed -15 hrs - left 16.40 hrs and arrived at YYZ -Toronto on time at 10.30PM. 
 
Its was hell at DEL airport while waiting 15 hrs...  Landed - My baggage one suite case was missing - took a day to log with air India baggage lost /missing. 
Its been 3 days no resolution, i am informed it can take 26 days to find my luggage- suitcase.

Past 10 years on Business - have taken over 900 flights and Air India is the worst air line in the world , that my rating."

They only cheat customers while booking ticket they don’t want any time of investigation but while boarding they want investigation and after that they don’t refund your ticket. It is totally  a way of earning in a very cheap way. I will never recommend to use this flight. Today my friend has all documents and has valid visa even he has boarding pass but they didnt allow him to travel."

After reading and watching so many poor reviews for Air India I was nervous about booking with them, but the business class seat price was very reasonable. I’m so glad I did as I couldn’t fault the service. The seats were dated but very comfortable whether upright or in full recline mode. The food was good and the drinks were readily available. The staff were particularly friendly and I was ushered through every business class fast track service on my way through Mumbai to Chennai. Overall, for the same price as a much longer Air France premium economy ticket, I got an excellent deal and would fly with them again."

Reason being that AI has always been considered as one of the worst airline in terms of service. Now as TATA took it over, decided to give a quick try on short trip to SIN. First leg verdict is horrible-on half of the plane (787) the entertainment system did not function. Even worst-even the reading lights did not work, as they are using same remote as screen. Everything was broken-table, remote buttons etc). Food was reasonable for 8 H flight, but very tiny portions. Service attitude was miserable-no smiles, no chat. I spoke with crew-they told that for them hardly anything has changes, except it has been getting more strict for them. Currently in the AI lounge in Delhi-this lounge should not bear Star Alliance lounge sign-very miserable food, few soft drinks and today there is NO alcoholic beverages due to some holiday-you must be kidding me. My recommendation-stay away as far as possible on AI, TATA takeover has not changed anything."

I will never fly Air India again, They sent me an email after my response to their email asking for feedback, they basically admitting how bad they are currently and they investing in new planes ?!  like that is an excuse for giving me such a poor experience, do they seriously thing I'm gonna give them another chance ?!

The huge disappointment was the Air India Lounge at Delhi Airport. For a national flagship it was shameful. Plenty of seats available, bur the food was grotty, and the drinks selection was rubbish. I was told beer was ""out of stock"". When I asked when they would restock it, blank looks. There was some Indian whiskey and vodka and some nasty looking South African wine. No gin. Mixers limited to coke and Fanta.

Air Astana lounge in Almaty was the worst I've been to, but this ran it close."

This delay had a significant impact on my travel plans, causing me to miss an important day of a wedding ceremony.

After the inconvenience and disappointment of the delay, I reached out to Air India's customer service to address the situation. While they offered a compensation of £520 as a goodwill gesture, I must express my disappointment with this outcome.

The offered amount does not adequately reflect the extent of the inconvenience, discomfort, and financial loss we experienced due to the delay. They provided 1-star hotel accommodation did not meet basic comfort standards, further adding to the frustration.

I understand that airlines have their policies, but I expected more understanding and consideration given the circumstances. I have tried to negotiate further, but Air India has stated that this is their final offer.

As a customer, I believe that a higher compensation amount would have been more appropriate, considering the impact on my travel plans and the missed event. It is disappointing to feel undervalued as a passenger, especially in a situation that was within the airline's control.

I hope this review serves as feedback for Air India to revaluate their compensation policies for such situations. As a frequent traveller, I expect better customer service and consideration for passengers facing such disruptions.
Pay more and travel by another good Air Line, this cheap flights are ok but when you get a problem no one wants to know you."

The reason I choose the flight was because it is direct and takes 15 hours to reach India. However, the experience was terrible. We were served water/drinks after being on the flight for 5 hours. The TV's and the seat light does not work. The airline staff puts off all the lights for the entire journey, so all you can do is sleep. But for people who can't sleep in the plane, there is nothing to do. No TV and you can't read a book, because your overhead light does not work. The food was terrible. All in all they charge termondously and provide no service. I would not recommend this flight to anyone."

Scheduled time 11.55 pm , checked in by 10.35 and waited near the gate, boarding time displayed  11.30......Nothing happened until 11.45, when one of the passengers questioned, they changed the boarding time to 12.15 am on the display. Nothing happened at 12.15 and passengers started shouting at the crew, but as  it is a usual custom for them , they were cool, pretending to talk over phone, infants, kids and aged people were in trouble.  
Finally boarding started at 1.am, departed by 1.20. Late by 1 hour and 25 minutes.
Inside the flight, full of mosquitoes, when complained, a crew member came with a spray and started spraying in the air, the particles flew directly into the eyes and it started eye irritation and burning sensation  for many. Then came the explanation , its not harmful to the eyes, happy that they didn't say its best for eyes.
Then came the food and beverages at 2am, woke up everyone who were in deep sleep just to hear ""we don't want anything"" from majority of passengers. Surprisingly I noticed the service due date on the trolley...16-04-2022, its almost 2 years past service due..... God knows whether its pedal  lock and wheels works...
 Hmm the same story  continues....No improvement...nothing has changed....Hope they spend at least 25% of their advertisement budget for staff training"

Please reconsider ever flying with this corrupt, dishonest and shameful airline. The ground crew in India lied to us and let us board our connecting flight to Toronto even though they accidentally booked us to Vancouver. So, when we boarded the flight there were no seats available and our bags went to Vancouver. My wife, 8 year old, 4 year old and 18 month child were not allowed to leave the plane and were forced to sit in the air crew area with broken seats, no trays, no overhead lighting or working screens. The ground crew cut off all communication to the flight crew, scape goated us and hung us out to dry. My wife who is still nursing, dislocated two discs on this flight because she was holding our son without backing to the seat. It was the most unbelievable experience. At the end of the flight, they calmed us down by stating we would be compensated. After two months, we finally found out their total compensation cannot exceed $200 cad total. AND even that amount we had to fight tooth and nail to receive."

Drinks weren’t even served till over 2hours later. Had to send my Bloody Mary back 3 times as the glass was filled to the rim with alcohol and tiny bit of tomato juice..Taste of food not great at all so better to take advantage of business lounges and stuff your face so not to have to eat on flight as though a nice menu is provided but sadly the taste of the food is very average. The aircrafts are randomly changed to the ancient aircraft’s by luring for a new aircraft. You will be lucky if you get the oldest Delta flights which are even 25 years old..truly a joke..Infact the service has got worse since its become private where even the staff were complaining that there is no training being provided to staff and they are being hired and thrown at the deep end..

"2024-03-15T01:46:03-04:00","1","review","1","Air India’s staff repeatedly lied to us for months in advance about pet travel. No accountability, just a delayed flight","I arrived in Chicago a day early to go to the airport ahead of our flight and show Air India staff the dog kennel we had purchase after significant amount of online investigation, just as one final verification that it was of the size and built with the hardware that were compliant with airline policy. It was only then, standing in the air port, 7 months, hundreds if not thousands of dollars, and many hours of preparation later, that I was told that Air India does not fly pets from the US to India (our layover was in Delhi). Now at that point I struggled to do anything and everything in my power to assure the staff of the fact that our pets travel had indeed already been approved and that multiple email communications and phone calls with customer representatives verified this. Surely Air India could not believe that we would have bought a one way ticket to the other side of the world bringing our beloved pet without repeatedly checking the requirements and regulations, but regardless of what we had been told (we showed them our emails) they said there was no possibility our pet was flying with us. As alluded to by our one way ticket, we were not going on a short vacation, we were moving to Nepal, for at the very least one year, with no return flights booked. The only reason we were choosing to fly with Air India was that after research, we (prematurely) trusted them with our pet more than some of the other airlines which had daunting reviews about the welfare of passenger’s pets. However, had we known that Air India does not fly pets from the US on any direct flight to India (something every single customer service representative should have been aware of had they been properly trained) we would have found an alternative means of getting our pet to Nepal. However, with less than 24 hours notice that our pet was in fact not able to travel, we had no recourse but to leave them in the US (with family, thank God), and go without them, a decision that was emotionally devastating, on top of causing us a significant amount of wasted money on preparation. We were given no explanation, redress, recourse or compensation from Air India. I originally submitted this message directly to Air Indias complaint department a month ago, but upon receiving nothing more ameliorating than a “we regret the inconvenience” email, I have decided to publicly review this company, and I wish to say that I do not leave negative public reviews as I always prefer to allow management of businesses an opportunity to fix there mistakes after consultation in private, but this egregious error on behalf of Air India has not been rectified and I feel the pinki should be aware of the ramifications of flying your loved ones, human or animal, with a company such as this. For the record: The AI director at Chicago O’Hare was kind and attempted to work with Turkish Airlines to do a ticket exchange, but after hours of negotiating the viability of that plan, and much waiting while they were behind the ticket counters in their offices (it felt like being held up by a used car salesman), we were finally given an offer of “potentially” being able to fly with our dog the following day, abandoning our confirmed reservation with Air India in lieu of a flight on Turkish for the small price of $5300. Perhaps if we in fact possessed that much liquid cash we would have allowed ourselves to be robbed in this manner, with the hopes of traveling with our pet, but it wasn’t even a possibility for us. So we would be moving without our beloved pet. To add insult to injury, our flight was delayed by 12 hours, and our connecting flight (also by Air India) by an additional 2 hours. Again, no explanation, compensation, or apology for any of this. The email thread discussing the initial delay in Chicago also had every passengers email CCed rather than BCCed which was a significant privacy violation likely one that could be litigated based on the potential consequences: (it’s only due to better my angels that I won’t publish that list here as a form of protest against this negligent company). My parents had to purchase an additional night in the hotel they were staying at to take our dog and to see us off the following day, so now they too we’re wasting money to to Air India’s incompetence and lack of customer service professionalism. My wife and I are having our traditional Hindu wedding ceremony in Nepal in October, something we decided to wait to do in her home country rather than in the US, meaning upwards of 50 people will be flying from the US to Nepal. We will be making sure that not a single one of them flys on Air India, nor will we ever fly with Air India again, and all of her Nepali friends, family, and relatives in her life and on her social media now know that Air India is not a company to be trusted. Don’t wager your happiness on a bad airline, just pay a little more for the quality you deserve."

The less positive aspects: 
The entertainment system is completely outdated and difficult to use. 

3 crew members for 18 passengers in Business Class (on our flight there were 14 passengers) - what a luxury, you might think. They make an effort, but the service is uncoordinated. Champagne Laurent Perrier - warm! Appetizer is ok - Fetta cheese with salad. Garlic bread cold and hard. No salt and pepper on the tray - no toothpick either. Main course - red snapper - really cold - not even lukewarm. The cold creamy fusilli was a portion of cold pasta in a cold sticky sauce. The dessert mousse was more like a rubbery marshmallow, the cheese was cheap quality, no crackers or bread. The Bordeaux red wine was very good. The cutlery is of the cheapest canteen pieces, the china ok. Everything is served on a gray plastic tray. 
The Amentiy Kit from Tumi are great. Also the Tumi Pyama, which is available in 3 sizes. Which is not really necessary for a day flight. After just under 2 hours, the second service was offered. We were glad that we could do without it. 
Less would be more - but better quality and a bit more style."
"2024-03-14T07:58:30-04:00","2","review","0","Poor service, especially for long-haul flights","I have travelled on Air India for many years right since my childhood while travelling between England and India - I recently travelled on 2nd February from London Heathrow to Kolkata via Mumbai and on 24th February 2024 from Kolkata back to Heathrow via Mumbai. However, I can say that the on board service, especially for long-haul international flights was quite poor (I usually fly through Economy) and really needs major improvements in future. 

The reasons for that are that they no longer provide in-flight monitor maps for longer fights (between 6-10 hours or more) - which is rather appalling for long distance flights as everyone has the right to know where exactly the plane is flying (really feels like a downgrade as there were usually in-flight maps years ago), the refreshment snacks could do with more choices (years ago they used to give peanuts which I liked but they now give some sort of corn snacks which wasn't too bad but more choices would be nice), the non-veg meals aren't always available and tend to run out more than the vegetarian meals (a few more meal choices would also be nicer for that), the film choices for films outside Hindi films was somewhat limited (I noticed when travelling towards Mumbai from Heathrow there were films like Oppenheimer & one of the recent Mission Impossible films but on my return journey back to Heathrow, they were no longer available), when the TV screens become faulty or crash (which seems more common now) the on-board crew don't seem to know how to fix them (whenever I've asked for the screens to be fixed or rebooted, the problem usually stays the same), and cleanliness in some areas needs some work. 

Another issue I have with Air India is that while the domestic flights are a bit better, there don't always seem to be as much updates when flight delays happen - my flight from Mumbai to Kolkata had a 3-hour delay but it took some time for the crew to update the passengers about the progress - which was supposedly down to poor visibility in Kolkata (might as well have deboarded the passengers back to the airport until the flight was ready to depart) while my return domestic flight to Mumbai got delayed and there was no update from the pilots or crew members about the reasons for that delay nor did they apologise for it which almost resulted in my & my family missing our connecting flight back to Heathrow (thankfully that flight waited for us and a few other delayed passengers).

Anyway, some positives are that most flights are usually on time and long delays are rare - that being said I'm not a frequent flyer, some of the crew members are quite polite & friendly (although there have been a few who were rude), the meals can be quite tasty when cooked/prepared well (although it can be a bit spicy/bland sometimes), the drink selection is good and it does have quite an extensive flight coverage inside India. However, the on-board service needs major improvements if they expect to be  world-class airline in the future - the Tata takeover initially made me hopeful for that although it is still taking them time to fix the issues I've mentioned (although I've read they're planning to refurbish some of the older fleet later this year which I hope does happen). I remember flying on Emirates when I was much younger and the service on Emirates was far superior than Air India even on Economy - more food/meal choices, in-flight maps on most flights, better selection of films, TV screens could be fixed during the flight if they became faulty and better cleanliness (if anyone from Air India reads this - take note). 

Unless Air India steps up their game in future - for which I could do an updated review, I would happily return to flying through Emirates in the future (or even try other airlines like Qatar Airways) if I am travelling alone - I usually fly through Air India when with my family as they for some reason prefer that in spite of its major flaws."

Also on 8th March Thiruvanthapuram to Delhi and then to Amristsar. Then return to Thiruvanthapuram on 10th and flew back to London via Mumbai on 12th . So multiple flights ( 8) in 12days , the air India staff were great , no issues very customer focused , food quality and taste excellent on board . Excellent leg room and seats comfortable . I noticed a few passengers had screens not working but they are in the process of upgrading all the planes this year.
The only issue  we had was during transfer from Mumbai to Thiruvanthapuram at Mumbai airport it was like a cattle market - complete lack of order and no queuing system , air India staff screeching at passengers waiting to check in their luggage again . That definitely needs improving !
Other than that all other Air India check in staff were very courteous and polite .
Amazing customer service and friendly Air India personnel at Thiruvanthapuram-exceptional!

Definitely will fly with Air India again."

Returning from India was also equally bad.  They had a 4 hour delay in Chennai and another 2 hour delay in Mumbai.  No explanation was given and they put us in a plane where everything was falling apart.   My sons’ food trays were so wobbly they couldn’t put any food on it. I had a torn seat.  My wife’s seat was reclined back so much she couldn’t put it straight.  When we brought it to the attention of the crew they simply said they’ll love her but never did it came around to explain why they didn’t.

I have not come across any world-class airline to change the seats after they confirm the selected seats. 
The silly thing is that they changed our seats and gave us seats in two different rows. They know we are two people flying under the same PNR one of us is listed as Mr. and the other is listed as Mrs. There is no common sense in reassigning the seats.

It looked like one of the Air India employees was using his power to allow his relatives to check in on the business class line even though they were flying economy. This has not happened to us ever before. 
This time we were told that since Air India is a private airline we have clear departure immigration in Mumbai and in Mumbai they will not let us go into the lounge before 4 hours of departure time. We had to wait outside in the check-in area until it was time for us to go. The ground staff at Mumbai airport was nice they did keep time and helped us with the process. This never happened before. Our luggage was checked in through but they stopped us I believe for security reasons but logically this did not make sense. 
Flight from Mumbai was good compared to past experiences mainly because the plane was newer. Overall flight experience was good, I would say the service was at the expected level for business class. Flight attendants could have been more attentive but that could be a lack of experience.  
This was the first time in my 40 years of flying Air India they did not deliver all our luggage upon arrival. It was chaos at Newark airport for reporting lost luggage. There were at least 70 passengers who did not receive their luggage. Some old people did not receive any of their luggage and there were mothers with little children who did not receive any of their luggage. Some of these people did not speak English properly and there was no help from Air India to help them. Other passengers had to help. We were told that this happens practically every week here in Newark. Something did not add up, how can 70 + passengers not receive their luggage? It must have been a deliberate decision on Air India's part not to send a container load of luggage. The reason in one communication was that due to over wait conditions bags were not loaded. I think someone did not do their job calculating weight or employees did favors to friends and let heavier bags go through. As for the priority tags for the business class passengers' luggage does not mean anything, They come out with all the other luggage never as a priority. What is the point of attaching the priority tag? This time two of my bags came out broken so much for traveling business class. 
Overall, there are some improvements but in some areas, they have gotten worse."

The woman I dealt with would not allow me to fly using an Australian emergency passport unless I could provide proof that I had applied for a regular passport. This delayed me about an hour at check-in as the woman left to check with whoever, and I needed to use my phone to log into GMail to look for an email from the Australian government confirming I had applied for a regular passport. There is no requirement to apply for a regular passport when applying for a regular passport, what would have happened if I could not prove I had applied for a regular passport?

Service is adequate, but the limited drink options leave much to be desired. My experience with security personnel at Delhi airport was particularly appalling, as they confiscated a purchased item without adequate explanation or resolution.

Flight delays and cancellations further compounded my frustration, with the airline failing to offer appropriate compensation or assistance.

In addition, the handling of my damaged luggage was unsatisfactory, with bureaucratic hurdles and poor communication hindering the resolution process.

Overall, my experience with Air India has been utterly disappointing, and I caution fellow travelers against choosing this airline."

MY LUGGAGE!!!!

Utterly disgusting service! Absolute shambles of an airline. Half the infight entertainment screens weren't working... including mine. For both my flights from BKK to Del. And then DEL to Uk. Children running wild and crying for the whole of the two flights. Even though people were trying to sleep and complained to the air staff. Nothing was done about it. When I collected my travel backpack in the uk it was clear to see that someone had been rummaging through my luggage. When I got home and checked my belongings, a belted waist travel bag was missing. They must of thought money or other valuables were inside? Thankfully it was empty. But my girlfriend had purchased it for me whilst on holiday there. My GF is Cambodian. And it was a goodbye present from her. I was so gutted, upset and disappointed that someone could do such a thing! Utterly flabbergasted at what happened! Called the airline and they just didn't want to know. The change over was a complete and total shambles. People panicking as it was taking that long to process people that they were in jeopardy of missing their connecting flights. So they were rushed through all of a sudden with no security checks whatsoever. Believe me when I say this... DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHTS WITH THIS JOKE OF AN AIRLINE! I will never darken their doorstep with my business EVER AGAIN!!? So so disappointing! Thanks for ruining the end of my holiday. On what was an amazing trip. And it was just as much of a shambles on my flights out there!! Wow! I really didn't think this type of thing was possible in this day an age?!?! 🥲"

It is not a airline that lives up to the normal standard of Star Alliance and in my personal opinion should be forced out of the Alliance. It is very poor quality in all aspects. I am sorry to say that even though I tested many airlines over the years this is probably the worst all categories. Even including low price budget airlines. Why you might wonder. Well. Hera are some examples why ... The plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment (as all airlines have) but the majority of the screens were not working. Might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem. Please prepare to have your own entertainment with you. The food onboard was really bad (normally I like the kind of food served in India but this was really bad). Take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by Air india... The plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good I would warn you for the not so pleasant flight. Service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good (I only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits)...
Now to maybe the worst problem ... My travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours. Ok that can happen and as we then are to be compensated by EU law with 600 Euros it is somewhat ok even though it is not nice as they kept reschedule by 15 min and no food or drink was offered (this is of course in direct conflict with international and EU law that demands free drinks and food on all delays more than 4 hours. This might be a good reminder of making sure I documented all the delay and got it in writing from the ground crew, which I didn't as I trusted a Star Alliance member to fulfill its obligations without any excuses). Now you might understand that when i asked for the legal compensation of 600 Euros (not for a full refund even though the entertainment, food etc weren't up to standard) they suddenly changed the delay cause to bad weather and not technical issues! This is a loophole in the law (which of course is correct as the weather is not something they can control but as there were other planes departing and arriving and the fact that the staff told us the technical issues, the change of plane and crew it is simply a way to avoid compensating). 
I would say that even though the Air India cost was lower than alternatives and that we believed Star Alliance to keep a good quality among their members we are extremely unhappy with Air India. I would urge anyone to take a second to evaluate if you really should book with this airline! I wouldn’t! It can be quite a bad start to your journey, and it is simply not worth the save! I would suggest you look at any other airline even budget before you choose Air India. We trusted Star Alliance and the fact that Air India is part of TATA as I also trust to be a professional business with a leader that shown great success. But his airline is a total disaster I am sorry to say. 
If I was TATA I would quickly erase my logo from this as it is really bad for the company image!"

The flight was delayed from 10:15 am to 14:30We reached Delhi around 9pm IST, instead of 17:40. our initial connection from Delhi to Mumbai was at 21:20. We completed the immigration: process at Delhi Picked up our Luggage and tried to check with Air India counter for our connecting flight. There was no assistance at the counter, The agent said she don't know anything and i will have to wait for her supervisor to arrive. After 10 minutes a gentlemen arrived and I informed him the situation, he said I need to go out and go to level 2. We went to the second floor (again no assistance by Air India). At level 2 after searching for 2 Air India counters Finally a counter issued us a boarding pass for flight AI605 with boarding time  0:45 am. Tired with the long and delayed flights we still hope that things would be smooth, to our surprise the flight was delayed to 2:45 am.( Note: No AI staff available at the boarding gates to inform .) At 4 am they announced that the flight was cancelled. Finally, an AI duty Manager arrived and informed that we need to collect out luggage from the belt and move to the AI reservation after exiting the airport where they have all arrangements ready. I did inform him that i am an Australian citizen with no contacts in Delhi and have travelled with AI from Sydney with my wife and 11year old daughter. He mentioned everything will be taken care of (Video Evidence available) We picked up our Luggage and went to the Reservation counter and to our surprise there were around 1000 to 1200 people stranded with no help from Air India. The arrangement was a chaotic, It was a cold Delhi early morning with my wife and daughter out in 5 to 6 degrees suddenly after the 20-degree Sydney Summer. Finally, I got hold of Mr Vikram Vats I am not sure if I pronounce the last name properly but i can provide evidence as I have his ID picture. I showed him my Australian passports and Boarding passes for AI 301 informed him that i have arrived from Sydney and had a connection to Mumbai. To my surprise he said he can't provide you either an alternate flight nor an accommodation so please find your alternate mode or even hotel and then take refund from AI. I didn't speak a word as my priority was to make sure my wife and daughter was safe and well, in this cold weather of Delhi. First, I booked a hotel room online on my own , got a taxi reached the hotel. Then booked for 3 Tatkal Tickets for Rajdhani express for 16th Jan. My wife and daughter was not very happy with this as they had heard a lot of stories about thefts in Indian Trains, but i had no option. As my hotel room was close to the airport my wife woke me up around 3am when she heard the sound of aircrafts landing and taking off, She asked me to go to the airport and check for the last time if we can get any rescheduled flight to Mumbai. I reached the airport at around 4 am I enquired about the tickets and the agent said why are you coming after 2 days > It was so annoying as there was no apology but instead they showed it as my mistake, I just kept quiet and took my tickets and went off, (Note there was no follow up email from Air India to check my whereabouts in Delhi on the 15th Jan Since they had cancelled AI 605.) In my 15 years of travel history this was the first time I travelled by Air India thinking it was taken over by TATA, but I was wrong.

Told the flight attendant and was offered magazines to read for a 14 hr flight…. My TV screen was scratched up as well, not that it was working anyways. Customer support over the phone was ZERO help as well when I was calling to make changes on my departure date. As an Indian, it’s embarrassing to have Air India represent the country of India. 

They need to make serious renovations with the interior of the plane. I can deal with bad in-flight food, bad customer service, rude flight attendants. But when a simple thing such an entertainment system not working on a 14hr flight and being offered magazines to pass the time is a slap to the face. 

There are much better options to fly in for the price that Air India is charging!! Do not fly Air India unless you are feeling lucky on your seat being clean and entertainment system working properly. In which the odds are slim"

My wife, daughter and I arrived at Hyderabad airport at 3 a.m. on january 15, 2024.
When we arrived we saw that flight AI 559 to Delhi had been cancelled.
INDIGO had the same flight to Delhi on the same day and same hour, which they didn't cancel, so there was no problem with bad weather.

We tried to get information and find a solution for 6 hours...standing up and talking to 4 different managers, no one could find a solution or give us reliable information.
6 hours waiting at the airport from 3am until 9am with nothing,,,
We returned to our hotel alone without any help from air India.
Then in the afternoon, with the help of an Indian friend, we managed to schedule the cancelled flight  by Air India for 2 days later, on January 17.

In addition to hotel, restaurant and cab costs (16,000 rupees total for 2 days), we had to change our flight from Paris to Sao Paulo at our own expense (108 euros).
I also lost two days' work at a cost of 220 euros.

In addition to the total lack of consideration shown by air India employees at the airport, the lack of professionalism
the plane we took from Delhi to Paris was in a deplorable state, dirty and old, the cinema system was not working, the food was horrible...

Air india refused to give  commercial gesture and compensation for all these inconveniences .
our indian friends tell us that they never take air India because it's so bad, alway canceling flights, old plane etc..

They have a front end and rear end not using the same brain!

Example 1:  my family travelled Dec 2023. Airplane was filthy, serving trays for food not washed and old.  Screen and seats don't work on way there.

On way back, flight was delayed 24+ hours at Delhi airport, not employees to provide update from AI, made passengers move gates a dozen times.  When did take off same quality of cleanliness on board food horrible.

Example 2:  Could not travel and had to cancel November 2023 for travel dec 31, 2023.  Told my ticket was refundable and would receive in 10-15 days by customer service.  Refund for over $10000!

Called customer service again in 20 days and was told my refund was kept for future use.  Morons can't follow customer instructions.  Then told refund would be issued within 10-15 days from Dec 1, 2023.

Called in 15 days as no refund and told their front end customer service does not communicate with their rear end, refunds dept!  Was told that they would send priority email to refund dept. To ensure I receive my refund.

Called many times in Jan 2024 to yell at customer service managers but they do not speak to their rear end staff and sent many ""priority emails"".  

Feb 2024, still no refund and receive the generic email from refunds apologizing for delay and that they are working diligently to investigate my refund!  Haha.

Ended up calling my Credit card company in Feb 2024 to dispute the charge on my card for AI and let their team investigate for me.

Never travel AI!  Pay a little more and travel comfortably and enjoy!"

The Morning staff at T2 stated that the gates are closed and now you will not be allowed. I tried to ask them if they might help me out as I was 1 hour early and I got an email for the Gate entry which stated I needed to be there 20 minutes before the boarding.  

But the staff were so rude that they just said no you may leave and book another flight. Now I would like to inform you all that I received another email for the boarding and this time they said the Gate number had changed and this email was shared with me at 10.40 AM. 

Due to the misbehavior of the staff I didn't get to see this email which I checked after coming out. Now if the staff had done their job correctly they would have known the gate was just changed and the door was still open. I could have got the flight today. 

Zero attention to the customer and their concerns. Instead of guiding me with the available options. The supervisor in the morning shift told me they couldn’t help me and walked away without even briefing me about the exit process due to which I had to reach out to other airline’s ground staff who then guided me through the process and asked me to check with the Air India team. 
2nd Instance - here also when I asked them to help me with exit they ROUTED me to different people and counters, by this time I was still inside and it was merely 11:10 am.

On the way back my connecting flight to Amritsar was delayed so that I could not make it to the London flight. Getting through to their customer service was a nightmare and you just so that you know you get cut off after 28 min. The flight was rebooked the next day from Delhi. No apologies or hotel accommodation. 

The Delhi to London flight was over 9 hours late. At this time I am awake for over 48 hours. They could not find a replacement pilot. Finally, the plane takes off and the food is bad and the entertainment system does not work. The plane is very old.

In all this, they get away with not giving any customer service or any gesture of compensation. It is a terrible service and airline."

To start being the national flight of India, persons with OCI cannot do self check-in.  I was flying with 3 others that all needed special wheelchair assistance, so in order to even check-in we had to wait in line first before they would even allow them to sit in the wheelchair area.  Now up to this point everything was a mild inconvenience.  However the flight itself was what made sealed the deal of never flying Air India.  For a direct long haul flight I cannot  believe the condition of the airplane.  The upholstery was dirty and falling apart held together with zip ties.

Flight left 2:50 hours delayed at Kathmandu and no refreshments or food was offered, which after Indian law has to happen for delays over 2 hours.

Due to delay and the connecting flight by air India not waiting like 10 minutes for us, got stuck at Delhi.

Customer service at transfer desk is the most rubbish ever experienced. Together with people from other destinations all on air India waiting for hours to get new tickets.

Worlds worst airline customer service!
I'm gonna do a credit card charge back. 20 hours delay overall for a flight supposed to take 10 hours, due to technical problems at air India (other flights going in/out from Delhi that morning were more or less on time).

"2024-01-30T13:05:58-05:00","1","review","0","Worst experience with AI airport staff and customer care","I have flown a few times on AirIndia and chose them for the ease of non-stop flight between Chicago and Delhi. 

I booked a flight to fly out for family emergency in Jan 2024 - my father was in the ICU. I booked the flight within 12 hours of scheduled departure time. So, one can imagine that this was a real emergency. I reached the airport well in time but forgot to take my OCI card -- given the stress I was under. This is where proper customer service should have come in. But, one cannot really expect that from AI.

The manager at the counter told me that if I dont bring my OCI within 30 mins, he will not let me board. We drove back and forth and were there with all documents 40 minutes before departure. I even offered to them that I will fly out without a checked in bag, and with a Global entry card, I would have got through security within 5 minutes.

Yet, the agent told me they closed the gate 45 mins before departure and he would not give me a boarding pass. It is worth noting here that per the boarding pass, the gate closes 20 mins before departure. So, technically, one is allowed to board until then. But this appeared to be a no-rule zone, where the ground staff decided how they want to operate. He even went on to say that my requests to let me speak to a supervisor to board - were causing him irritation and he was really irritated while dealing with me. Basically he was irritated dealing with a passenger who wanted his help in flying out during a family emergency. Such people really should not work in a customer care job, let alone in an airport. To top that, his colleagues came in to ask ""do you have the OCI card in your possession right now"" and when I replied in the affirmative, they said ""okay, you cannot board. it is final"". I just didn't understand the genesis of that question given their final response. It is almost as if they wanted a reason to deny boarding. Note that this is an international flight, so denying boarding means one cannot leave until the next day at the very least. This was not a leisure trip, so one day meant a lot! Note that the flight was not even full -- in fact, it was at 50% capacity. The manager was more interested in relaying how there is a whole process to be followed after boarding, like printing the list and preparing a meal plan. Really? A meal plan means you close boarding 45 mins before departure? Then why do your boarding documents mention 20 mins before departure. This is misleading. 

I have never seen this type of behavior in the aviation industry. Closing gates 45 mins before departure especially when a customer is right there and asking for help -- is in my opinion, the antithesis of customer care. It was sub par treatment. The airport staff could have rebooked me on the next flight but they wanted to charge me more calling it a no-show. They redirected me to book with the airline call center. 

Next comes the customer service with AI. After numerous calls and escalations, they were blunt to the point of saying ""you can be on the call for 10 more hours, you will end up paying to get on the next flight."" Note that all major carriers allow for free rebooking if one arrives at the airport  prior to the departure. But AI has a different policy -- just a money minting scheme.

Worst airline, poor uncooperative staff, they are better off without staff. Even robots can read off policies to the customer, we dont need real humans rattling off the same policy over and over and relaying that the phone call is immaterial.

Never again! I would give 0 stars if I could."

That, unfortunately, was my experience on my recent flight with Air India. From lukewarm, unappetizing meals to malfunctioning entertainment systems and lackluster amenities, the journey fell far short of expectations.

I paid about £600 GBP return. The plane itself looked old, unclean and worn-out. The meals on the return flights were unappetizing, too spicy, and the appetiser was a basic crunch corn in a small packet. Hot drinks were tasteless and cold. Very little choices of salad, dessert and drinks. The entertainment system is not functioning on both occassions. I paid £ 23.60 GBP, for the seat 21F from Heathrow airport to Delhi and also for 18F from Delhi to Heathrow. The washrooms were unclean, have strong stench and consistently run out of toilet rolls. The service was frustrating. I requested for an earphone to at least listen to music since the movies were unavailable, but the crew promised to bring but never returned. I politely requested a crew to close the luggage compartment as I have shoulder issue and she made a face and annoyingly said 'this is heavy'. I requested for a toothbrush and the crew said they will get and never came back to me. 

I am a regular traveller and understands journey issues can happen. However, the frustration, boredom and dissapointment were unrivaled this time. I wasted money, missed the opportunity of a good flying experience and was stressed. 

I hope you can improve quality and variety of meals. Train staff to be more proactive, attentive and promote professionalism. Enhance amenities and hygiene. Ensure that the paid seats are worth and invest in reliable technology to ensure entertainment system is working properly."

Secondly I missed the flight on 13th Jan morning and today is the 26th of Jan which means 13 days  have passed by and I have had no email or call from the airlines regarding any refund. For them it is like they don't even know that I did not take the flight , for them it's only the money that matters.  I thought since TATA has acquired the company now I would have a better experience but intact it was more worse ."

I had to give it a 1/5 as you can't give it a 0/5 unfortunately.
Worst airline ever..!! DO NOT FLY WITH THIS UNORGANISED AND AWFUL AIRLINE!!!
I do travel frequently due to work and leisure. I travel all over the globe and I thought i'd try this airline purely for it's bad experience and after reading the endless negative reviews. I travelled alone..
I'm a British Indian and on returning to the UK from Mumbai in Janury-24, the airline forgot to transfer my luggage and left it at New Dehli. When I called the Customer Service desk, their only response was ""go and collect your luggage from New Dehli"", when I had already arrived in the UK. I have now spent over 10 hours (over two days) trying to educate the awful Customer Services that I am now in the UK-England and you are still asking me to go and get my luggage from New Delhi. Keep away from this airline as you are wasting your hard earned money. The other reviews echo what I experienced. You are risking your life with this diabolical airline. The screens in the seats do not work, the USB ports are damaged, even my dog would not eat the airline food -its disgusting. The stewards smell and as they walk past. After speaking to friends and family, I should have taken their advise and not opted to fly with this awful and terrible airline. You have been WARNED !!!"

Very good overall and I would recommend. Quite impressed. Staff were all friendly and pleasant from checking in to cabin crew. Boarding was done quickly, as was alighting at the other end. Baggage was delivered in a speedy manner each time. In some cities, checking in lines were long but they moved quickly and staff were very efficient. They even provide food on all short-haul flights. Again, done speedily, so guests had enough time to eat. Depending on length, it could be a sandwich, a full meal or a light snack. Very generous. Most European carriers don't do this. Planes were generally clean and comfortable for short-haul. No inflight entertainment or any other frills being short-haul but seats were comfortable enough. Checking in online was easy. My bag was overweight but staff were very nice and let me through with the excess weight except once where I had to pay. Internal flights were all very cheap. I flew IndiGo Airlines once which is a low-cost airline. Awful. Air India were way better. One of my flights was delayed by an hour but it was fine as these things happen and we made the time up in the air. The others all departed on time, we arrived on time and a few times early even. Just a few things, security in India is very tight. Give yourself enough time at the airport. Get there early. Despite checking in online being easy, there were not many free seat options left. I used to check in as soon as the window opened (usually 48 hours before departure), but there were few free seats available. My small negative was safety procedures were very rushed and not complete. They gave us the briefing about the oxygen mask but nothing on the lifejacket. This was detailed in the safety card but normally the lifejacket is also part of the demonstration. Would recommend otherwise, if travelling internally in India"

My flight was due to take off at 8PM, they kept delaying the flight by an hour until 1 am, when they canceled the flight. We were up until 4 am while they tried getting some people hotels, but were not able to get everybody hotels. I was told to stay at the gate in the airport overnight - I slept on the floor- and that somebody would come back in the morning at 8 am. Nobody from Air India came back. They did not provide many people with a place to sleep, or with meals, which they are legally supposed to do. 
Air India then told me I had another flight the next day - I ended up waiting in line at the airport for 7 hours to board this next flight, only to be told I could not board it because they did not get me on the connecting flight. I was then left again overnight. 
I was stuck at the airport for 48 hours. 
The whole time, they were nearly impossible to contact - When I called about the canceled flight, according to their support service the flight took off, and ""I was already on the way to Melbourne."" - I WAS STUCK IN PARIS! If you looked up the flight, it said it arrived successfully. Furthermore, I was getting emails saying my bags were safely transferred in Delhi, and arrived safely in Melbourne - Those emails are complete lies, as my bag was with me the entire time. 
When stuck at the gate, the crew had a random passenger take down names and numbers from the passengers on a scrap piece of paper, then another crew member did not know why they were doing that - that was horrible miscommunication. They were trying to get passengers who were strangers to each other to share hotel rooms as well. 
To top it off, I was at least entitled to €600 EU compensation which is a European LAW that passengers of canceled, or delayed flights have the right to. I was in contact with Air India support to receive this, and they said I would receive it within 3 weeks. After 4 weeks, I reached out again, and told I would still get it within another 3 weeks. Then they closed my case, and I NEVER received the compensation. And because they closed the case, I could not contact them about it anymore! When I opened up another case about all of this, they closed that one saying to respond to the previous case, BUT IT WAS CLOSED! So I cannot contact anyone through it. This has been going on for 4 months, and I am still unable to get ANY help. 
They have hung up on me multiple times when calling, ignored emails, falsly stating they will help when they will not. I have never delt with a company so unprofessional in my life. Every step of the way, they were not communicating, even amongst the crew when the flight was initially cancelled. 
Absolutely terrible experience, I will always tell people to avoid Air India at whatever cost!!"

On arriving at destination in Mumbai we realized one of our suitcases did not get loaded from Delhi. Mistakes happen, I understand. I was told i would have my baggage delivered to my address in India, Which it did the following night about MIDNIGHT. I received an email from baggage department accepting responsibility for the mistake & offered me a mere 2000 INR as compensation. They requested information from me ie Indian bank account number, Account name, Bank name, Branch address, Account type, IFSC code ?,First page of passbook & Passport copy. I replied to their email explaining that the offer was not appropriate as the baggage contained vital medication for my wife which left both of us very anxious & stressed. I also added that we were tourists in India & we don't have an Indian bank account. I received a reply saying this email address was not valid & gave me another link to send it to, So i did. After waiting a few days i emailed them again, Phoned the numbers that were on their contact details but had no communication back by phone or email. I got fed up with all the lack of communication, not knowing who or how to contact them i thought i'd wait till it was time for return flight back to UK & speak to somebody at the airport. When I got to Mumbai airport i spoke to someone the customer service desk, They very unhelpful & didn't seem to care, very rude & dismissive. On the flight back from Delhi to Birmingham the aircraft was not the best, Loo's very dirty, Inflight entertainment & USB chargers not working & actually not even fitted leaving big holes in the seats where they were supposed to be. Might all be small things but it makes a 9.5 hour flight seem like a 20 hour flight. In short there seems to be no customer care as if passengers don't matter, Very poor condition aircraft's for a flagship airline & very bad communication & people skill's from staff. I certainly won't be flying Air India again & would not recommend it to anyone. If you do travel Air India BE PREPARED."

I refused and purchased a ticket from Indigo for $275.01.  When I arrived in BOM, AI staff was not helpful and extremely disrespectful in helping me locate my luggage.  They would not take a PIR but wanted me to file one through Indigo.  I said I would file both.  I didn't check a bag with Indigo so no need, but AI refused.  After 10 hours was told luggage was resent to DEL.  Had to wait 2 days to go back to DEL.  When I reached DEL,  it took 6 hours to get my luggage!  Finally able to properly start my trip!  December 27th had a direct flight to EWR from BOM.  Was told my flight was cancelled because I missed my connection on 8 December to BOM.  Told I had to pay $300.89 to reinstate flight or would have to purchase a new one way ticket!  Staff disrespectful and I should not have had to pay for flight to BOM or penalty because I didn't miss flight to BOM on purpose. Requested money back using Grievance Process.  They referenced a flight arriving 8 January 2024.  When I told them I arrived to DEL 8 December 2023, they copied same information of the previous response.

The planes were simply worn out. Neither I or my partner had any in flight entertainment on any of the four long haul flights to and from Australia. Instead they simply lied to us about its existence and kept going through a ridiculous charade of saying ""we will try and reboot it"". Finally the cabin staff admitted most of the screens had not been functional for a long time and were unlikely to be fixed until the planes were re-fitted in 5 months time. So the airline is knowingly selling a service they can't provide. The staff are forced to at first lie and then avoid the passengers. You can't even call for assistance... because nothing worked. When I asked at check in if the next flight would be the same they told me that it was a different plane and would be fine. Guess what? The screens were hanging off and some of the handsets were torn apart... no doubt from previously frustrated passengers. The vents beside my seat were simply duct taped on. Water dripped from overhead when the plane took off. If the airline had warned us about the lack of IFE... we might have planned better. This was not just our seats but the majority of the rear economy cabin. When we tried to contact customer support in Melbourne to change tickets... they were uncontactable. We tried all means and left many messages to be called back. We got nothing. This airline is simply appalling. If this is the flag carrier of the nation... it leaves a bad taste. Those planes and the service behind them is an embarrassment. Spend your money elsewhere."

"2024-01-13T16:05:36-05:00","1","review","0","So bad it became funny","Paid extra for seats with leg room on the long haul flights London to Melbourne via Delhi. 

London to Delhi Plane appears dirty and unkept.

The flight was a little late taking off from London which I don't have a problem with as things happen. Once all the passengers were on the senior cabin attendant literally threw the ground crew off the plane and was running around at full speed doing checks / securing items to get the plane away faster. I have never seen anything like that before and I was thinking to myself that's not good, hope he does not forget anything important but at least he is not the pilot!!.  

Being in a emergency exit row (seat 11C) one of the younger flight attendants came over to explain the emergency door procedure to me and the other 2 ladies sitting in my row. Unfortunately her English was quite poor, that combined with the engine noise as we were taxiing hastily, coupled with the fact she was speaking fast &  rushing to tell us as we where about to take off. (none of us sitting in the row understood exactly what she said.) Being a seasoned traveller I know what to do in any event but let's be honest that's not really the point is it. 

So lets settle in and fire up the entertainment system....er nope its not working, reported to flight attendant and with the look on her face she knew it was broken but she said she would reset it which did nothing to fix the situation so she reset it again and still not working. She then did not come back so I guess she gave up pretending she was trying to fix it. Oh well onto plan B, I'll get my book out. Oh dear reading light not working as it's on the entertainment system remote. In addition the seat remote has the attendant call button thus that was not working too. Guess if I need assistance I'm out of luck there too. On a positive note the seat USB works so I can at least charge my phone and once I got the attendants attention she switched the light on for me, unfortunately  I have never been able to sleep when I fly so sat there in the darkened cabin with my reading light blazing like the sun for the entire flight as I can't turn it off.

Refreshment service was very limited with soft drinks, white and red wine. (I tried the red and it was un drinkable) & beer, the lady I was sitting next to asked for a G&T but not available apparently. Then the meal arrives. See pictures. Choices are veg curry or chicken curry. Good o I thought I like curry. As I said see pictures. So let me summarise. When you think curry you think roti or nan maybe, well I do but not a dinner roll as supplied. Curry bland but a little heat, rice over cooked. Side bland, desert some kind of cold set cheese cake which was not bad but not an Indian dessert which I would of preferred after my curry but to be honest it was the best thing on the meal tray. 

The first toilet I visited had a badly stained sink,  flaking paint on the walls and the door lock handle was a screw!!!

To anyone who thinks I'm making this up please see the photos!!

I sent this experience to air India for a response before I posted it but customer service is of the same standard as the flight. Nothing for days only a we are very sorry and will get back to you so I posted without any real response. If they do ever get around to it I'll post the reply. If the do reply hopfully it's not one of them standard thankyou for your feed back we will pass your comments to our team (yawn) aka we don't give a sh1t.

Now I know what you thinking this guy massive chip right? No wrong infact I stayed at the Raddisan before the  flight and had a buffet breakfast there. Now Im not a fan of buffets normally however this one was very go, so good I left a £10 tip and I'd go as far as say almost as good as table service, almost but that's another review.

Delhi to Melbourne food similar as on London flight but tasted way better. Must have been prepared in India not London as previous.

Entertainment system I believed work however I don't know as my screen was jammed in the seat. My tray table was missing from my seat so had to lean across and use seat table next to me to eat. 

Again I was in a extra leg room seat this time near the wing 30H. Unfortunately I could not use the leg room as the floor around the door was heated so much it permitted throw my shoes. Like putting my feet on a hot radiator for the full 13 hour flight.

I reported all these problems but got no where. Nothing they could do it's just the way it is.

I only book this trip at very short notice and I will not book air India again. Qatar is the airline for me from now on. 

The sweet taste of a cheap price is soon forgotten with the bitter taste of poor service."

It was a red eye flight and the service etc really didnt matter and all I wanted to do was to get some rest.  I had blocked the extra leg room seat and that was really comfortable.

The cabin was clean and the seats were comfortable .

Check in was smooth and the staff at the counter were really helpful.

I faced one issue while boarding.  I was sitting at the lounge and display kept showing ""Security"" and I waited.  Later I walked towards the gate, though it was still showing ""security"" and on the way I got a call from Air India saying its the final call and they are closing the gate.  I had to kind of rush and also explain to them why I got late.  Not sure if the issue is at the the lounge end/airport end/airlines end.  I was alone and didnt have any bags etc so it was ok, but if someone had to run with family /kids/elders etc it would be a challenge in such situations."

Here’s the gist of my win win experience during my return via Air India flight 310 from Mumbai to Melbourne .

Just like the stellar performance of the complete Air India crew during my first non stop flight from Melbourne to Mumbai via this great carrier,  surprisingly this time too my entire trip experience with all the nitty gritty involved from inception to culmination of the journey has been exhilarating and par excellence . “ Encore “ .

The check in at the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminal was seamless and the flight ran as per scheduled timings which was a real relief straightaway .
As soon as I boarded the flight , I felt that  I am in the cocoon of warmth and care with all the sweet flight attendants scurrying around and aiding all the passengers to get sorted with their luggage and seats .

Throughout the long journey I was impressed with the flight attendants attentiveness and dedication to detail and most of all their cheerful exuberance. It is indeed such a positive feeling to be among attendants who incorporate their duty with a smile on their face at all times . It really makes my day .and releases my”  feel good “ hormones .

I am having a treat of a journey with the love and care showered on all of us here .
The ambience is heavenly and the cuisine is noteworthy . In totality and in a nutshell I feel really privileged and my journey is almost done without me realising it’s length .

From the bottom of my heart I would like to thank the zone in charge on board named Poonam for her apt handling of all staff as well as I would like to specially thank the great team comprising of Anannya, Jenus ,Rekha , Jenifa and Vidhi
They have touched my heart with their warm spirit , diligence and cheerful disposition . Kudos to the team . Keep it up sweeties .

Best wishes to the flying crew too headed by captain Jasmine Mistry who have ensured a safe journey for all of us .

Hip hip hooray Air India . Keep it up ."

Just before we left Bangalore we got a notice that the 2:30 pm departure from Delhi was delayed until 9:30am. A 9 hour delay, great, all night on an airport bench.  When we arrived at Delhi AI was, apparently, trying to segregate Chicago, Toronto (which was delayed as well) bound passengers and put them in a hotel.  Not that they announced it, but there was a huge crowd blocking the transfer gate so I asked what was going on.  Well, ok.  

This is when the nightmare started. After 3 attempts got registered with AI that we were on the Chicago flight.   No communication from the staff what was going on.  Information was word of mouth from the crowd of confused AI passenger’s. No one really knew what was going on.

AI finally said taxis would take us to a hotel.  Total mob confusion and pushing as passengers rush to get in taxis.  Which taxis?  What hotel? Drivers didn’t even know. 

Twenty minutes later headed for a hotel AI apparently arranged.   Never heard of it.  Got to a little crappy hotel and a hundred passengers pushing and yelling to get rooms. Nothing was arranged.  Where are we ? How do we get a room? How do we get back ? 

A mob of pissed taxi drivers trying to get someone to pay for the fares for all these passengers they just brought over. Turns out that no AI staff even came along. 

Fast forwarding through the horror story, 2 hours later, 2:00 am, AI still had not contacted the hotel, not one person had checked in.  Passengers screaming and yelling at the hotel staff and each other. Kids crying.   

Realizing this was going no where, Wife and I called and booked another hotel and got an Uber to take us there. Make our own arrangements to get back to airport in the morning. 

Finally on flight to Chicago.  Wife’s infotainment system doesn’t work.  UBS ports on our row are broken and taped over.  

This experience again reflects AI total incompetence and disregard for their customers.  If this is how AI handles what we CAN see, it raises concerns how they handle areas that we CAN’T see. 

In summary, one of my worst travel experiences, thanks AI.  We will never book a flight with AI again, even if it is free."

The lounge at DEL was OK and had reasonable breakfast options. Had a 30 min delay at BOM due to heavy traffic, but this was beyond AI's control.

However, the aircraft VT-PPH (A321) was old and they need to look after the plane better: the interior was dirty, the seats old and rock hard and the aircraft made sounds - especially the nose wheel - that are not typical for an Airbus A321, even when the aircraft is older. 

All in all, 2/5 for the hardware and maintenance, 5/5 for the service at check-in, during the flight (Mr Bhuwan) and at DEL & BOM. Looking forward to flying with AI again, especially on their A350 that has just been added to their fleet a few weeks ago."

"2024-01-05T14:17:30-05:00","1","review","0","Unimpressive ","Dear Customer Relations Department,

I am writing to express my utmost disappointment and frustration with the food served on my recent Air India flight. I believe it is crucial to provide feedback on the quality of the food to help improve the overall dining experience for future passengers.

Firstly, the presentation of the meals was unappealing. It gave the impression that the airline did not prioritize cleanliness and attention to detail.

Unfortunately, the taste of the food matched the unappealing presentation. The dishes lacked flavor and were incredibly bland. It seemed as though no effort was put into seasoning or enhancing the taste of the meals. The lack of taste made the dining experience extremely disappointing and left me regretting my decision to choose Air India as my airline.

Moreover, the quality of the ingredients used was questionable. The vegetables served in the main course were either overcooked and mushy or undercooked and raw. This inconsistency in cooking the vegetables not only affected the taste but also compromised the overall quality of the meal.

In addition  rolls provided were stale and hard, making them nearly impossible to eat. The lack of freshness in the bread rolls further highlighted the poor attention to detail in the food preparation.

It is essential for an airline to provide passengers with a satisfactory dining experience, especially on long-haul flights. Unfortunately, the food served on my Air India flight fell far below acceptable standards. The lack of taste, poor presentation, and substandard ingredients were highly disappointing and left a lasting negative impression.

I strongly believe that Air India should prioritize improving the quality and taste of the food provided to passengers. This will not only enhance the overall flight experience but also contribute to the airline's reputation and customer satisfaction.

I would also like to mention that the air hostess was extremely well behaved and very assisting,(the only good thing)

Moreover while booking the tickets i was provided with various options for food to be selected but in actual the food served was only of 2 kind (veg and non veg rools)

I sincerely hope that my feedback will be taken into consideration and that Air India takes immediate steps to rectify the shortcomings in their onboard catering services. I trust that my concerns will be addressed to ensure a more enjoyable and satisfactory experience for future passengers.

Thank you for your attention to this matter."

They have serious management, operational efficiency and staff behavioural issues. It was and continues to be badly managed organisation even after Tata’s takeover also. Sadly there is not even one plus that I can figure out. Tata’s need to act immediately. 

We booked tickets at 3 times the normal price due to black dates of travel which offered us very little flexibility. 

Old worn aircrafts, non functional entertainment screens, rude ground staff, seat recliners not working, no time
management. There was not even one leg of journey where the flight was not delayed by 3 hours.

Last leg from Hyd- Del- LHR was the nail in coffin. For Hyd to Del leg dtd 30/12 (AI 543), passengers were asked to board after 2 hours delay and then asked to sit in Aircraft further for 1.30 hours. Shocking, there were no pilots to operate the flight leading to this delay. The ground staff and flight supervisor told repeatedly to connecting 27 passengers (to London Heathrow) that connecting flight from Delhi AI 165 is waiting to accommodate them. To our shock, the flight had departed 50 mins before we landed. The whole ground staff is rude, brazen and 1000’s of passengers are suffering everyday. Avoid Air India at any cost as they deserve no more than 0 star rating. Eventually after so much fight for a place to reach final destination, we boarded AI 161 after 13 hours of actual departure (of AI 165) from New Delhi and have just arrived in LHR. We faced 16 hours delay on a 11.5 hours travel from hyd-del-LHR which speaks volumes about the operational efficiency. Other remaining 12 passengers are still stuck in Delhi and shall board in the evening after 27 hours plus delay. 

I am surprised why Aviation ministry in not pulling these airlines for utter nonsense? Toilets have out of order or donot use signs.

Happiness partially due to new terminal for AI at Chennai airport, so hardly any flights, deserted, instant check in , thru security in two minutes, very nice lounge. Air India staff themselves were very courteous, prompt, efficient, both the flight to BLR and return were 15 minutes before time, continous updates thru SMS about gate flight status, baggage etc etc. Clean aircraft smooth flight, online booking and check in worked very well, baggage came fairly quick. Even on actual fliying time of 45 minutes snacks or a drink were served. 

Not a single thing to find fault with, hope it further improves all the time and changes from old culture. Well done"

The seats are really Good, Leg space is much better.

The Terminal has been changed to terminal 4. I did get SMS, Thank You.

Since, I was changing flights, it was a long way to walk. You have arranged the battery operated cars, very good, but there is no information, there is no notice to assemble in a particular place.

I found a lot of Air India employees around the counter looking for job.

All you need to do is post one of them or two of them to stand with the placard holding such a way that ""Air India passengers with connecting flight welcome"". You can direct them to the battery operated cars. You also have to display boldly to assemble here for terminal 4 or something similar to that.

I hope you take this suggestion."

Experiencing the first direct flight from Melbourne to Mumbai . Sweet .

Me a Melburnian travelling first time non stop to the city of my roots . Hint of nostalgia with a feeling of exhilaration. 

No stop overs . No in betweens . Just me and my soul from a city of my dreams to the other city of my dreams . Fairy tale times .

This pioneer flight of Air India has made my day though I must say this travel venture was one filled with apprehension  at the start due to the fear of the unknown and a tinge of mystery . What will it entail ? How will it eventuate ? Will my dream journey be realised with all my set expectations .

And here I am . In the midst of the flight . Standing in the galley and basking in the ambience and warm hospitality of the gentle and efficient crew members . Oh what a feeling ……

Right from the check in at the airport to the inception of the flight , the experience has been smooth and seamless .

Greeting me at the entrance to the aircraft were the well groomed air hostesses beautifully attired in Indo western fusion style . So quaint . Love the fashion .

The flight attendants charming  persona with their warm exuberance bought me over straight away . Soft spoken and polite they are definitely a delight.

The catering service of the airlines is remarkable and the cuisine served at intervals has been one of the best my taste buds have experienced during my numerous travels throughout many years .

All through the flight I am experiencing care and warmth and my long journey is nearly done at the blink of my eyes .

I pinched myself to check whether this wonderful experience is really true and in reality it is . I am living the dream . Swear it. .

My pioneer journey is filled with all the thrills , fancies and luxuries I desire on such flights along with the care and attention of the flight attendants , the wonderful job of the flying squad and the great ambience here .

Special mention to the supervisor on board Greta for her apt demeanour and the efficient team of Anjali , Karima , Bhavna Shiba , Dapisha and Krisel 

I will say “ Three cheers to Air India and its crew “ and hope that this reverberates everywhere and at all times .

Thank you dearies . Take care ."

I decided to give them a try again after many years of avoiding them in favor of other carriers.   First the positives. The checkin process was smooth and timely.  There were many people in line but there were many attendants at the counter and it was a good experience. Should note though they are very picky with weigh, weighing even computer bags.   Similarly the boarding process was orderly and efficient. 

Once getting on the plane is where the positives ended.  The plane was aged., with alternating red and orange stained cloth seats and yellowed plastic reminiscent of the 70’s.  Honestly it seemed like they must have recommissioned a retired plane from another carrier.  
My entertainment system didn’t work.  My wife’s entertainment system barely worked, responding sporadically to touch commands. Not that it mattered much since there were only 4 old English movies. Only 1 of 3 USB charging port worked in our row so we all shared.  There were no AC outlets. 

Incredibly, 4 lavatories in the main cabin labeled “out of service’ and apparently had been for some time from the worn sign. Of course this resulted in long cues.  

We had to wonder if this was the level of disregard for non-critical systems, what is their level of concern for critical systems.  
Food was tasteless as it was colorless.  They didn’t offer coffee for all meals and no beer. 

In conclusion, in my many years of flying, overall Air India consistently gives the worst experience. No doubt it will be another 10 years before I am willing to try them again. "

Firstly, my flight from Heathrow to Delhi was delayed by around 3 hours. 
Then, irrespective of the seats i had chosen during web check in, which i had done well in advance, i was issued new boarding passes with completely different seats. 
I missed my connecting flight to kolkata due to the previous delay. 
Air India and staff failed to clarify details related to immigration and baggage claim until the last minute. 
After the exhausting 8 hour flight from London to Delhi, they announced baggage claim at Belt 13 and without warning, changed the Belt to 12. This caused unnecessary panic and confusion throughout the airport for multiple arriving passengers. 
Due to this confusion, i was late to re- check in my baggage for the connecting flight. 
My original flight for 6:30am had already departed. I reached the check in counter at 7:03am and requested the staff to put me on the next flight which was at 7:40am. Instead, one of the male staff members who was not even handling my case, very rudely, replied saying that it is already 7:10am we can’t put you anywhere else. I had checked, for a fact that there was a 9:40am flight available and i could have easily made it to the 7:40am flight. Irrespective, there was no reason to speak so rudely when i had been nothing but patient. I was then issued a ticket for the flight departing at 12:20pm. A 5 hour wait, and a complete disruption for all my scheduled work. 
Again, the new boarding pass had a different seat -middle seat, instead of the aisle i had purposely choosen to avoid being uncomfortable.
I am sitting here, waiting for my 12:20pm flight and i was just informed of another delay to 12:50pm. It’s not only about the time and energy that this kind of bad management drains away from every passenger but the mental exhaustion that causes unnecessary stress and so many more problems. "

They did this several times with other passengers and after 8 hours when there were enough people, they filled up one plane to send everyone to Amritsar. They said it was due to technical issues.. really? One flight crew even asked my son to move from his seat because they were short of a seat, after intervening I told them we are not moving from these paid seats unless you refund, the staff just walked off. Horrible staff, late flights, disgusting food, smelly passengers yuk, I’ve had enough and never will be flying again with air India."

The fact that they offer cheap tickets is not worth the stress and hassle this airline and its horrendous staff put u through!! This horrific experience starts with my parents who are 70+ checking in a wk before myself and my husband who were met with a rude and incompetent member of staff from AIR INDIA at the check in desk who made them unpack their luggage without a valid reason and refused to provide a name when we informed we will be making a complaint. The staff was very rude and didnt give any correct information with regards to flight and also didnt give a boarding pass and reason as to why she couldn't just rudely told my parents to move along!! Then comes mine and my husbands time to fly with them boarding was a mess as they do not provide clear boarding instructions and let everyone push in, then once boarded the plane was delayed an hour due to unknown reasons which staff didnt think to inform!! Once we are ready we noticed the in flight entertainment had an error msg on the screen and after multiple complaints to on board crew members even their supervisor we were told its being rebooted only to then be told 3 hrs later that its not been working for a while now and that they have informed their higher ups about this ongoing issue but nothing has been done!!! I mean thats just ridiculous!!! I also asked one of the staff for water and waited 30mins to see the same lady walking past me again and again so had to ask again until i got some water...people in prisons even get their basic needs quicker!! Next shambles was we had a layover in Delhi which was supposed to be 5 hours and then flight was delayed so layover changed to 8 hours and then got even more delayed to 11 hours which was an absolute nightmare!! They didn't offer any compensation or even refreshments which other airlines like Emirates etc do!! I think we were thankful that we didnt have to board their airline again for a while once we landed in Ahmedabad!! The domestic flight from Ahmedabad to Delhi was fine to say the least but staffs attitude and service was a minus 1000 once again!! We were given the wrong baggage claim information on the flight and waited like silly ppl at the incorrect belt for almost an hour until i took the initiative to check the screen and realise our baggage was on a completely different belt!! Dont give information out if u dont know!! Then comes our final flight back to London from Delhi which was also rubbish and kind of expected after all the previous problems as surprise surprise the in-flight entertainment wasnt working yet again, food was also disgusting on all flights something i wouldn't even feed any living breathing animal or person!! And service was pretty much down in the dumps. From about 28 years ago with my first flight with Air India i had made up my mind that i will never EVER be flying with this airline again but as that was many years ago i thought their service may have improved but boy was i really wrong!! It worse than ever and even if the tickets are free i would NEVER EVER fly with this airline again!! I will also be telling ppl i know or dont to refrain from flying with this airline!! I have fed all this back to air india on their feedback form and apparently was told i would be getting reimbursements for it all which i am not holding my breath on!! I come from a customer service environment job and AIR INDIA this was absolute garbage for the amount money u take from passengers i actually hope u better ur service or end this airline!! Train ur staff on customer service and tell ur higher ups to stop being money hungry greedy pigs!!!"

We were due to depart at 12.35 and arrive at 17.25 pm, local time. This is a scheduled ten hours and twenty minute flight, Goa is five and a half hours ahead of UK.

Due to the length of the flight we thought it best to travel in the Busines Class Cabin, for the additional space and comfort.

We were able to check in online and confirm our seats forty-eight before departure, which we did.

Boarding was due to commence at 11.35 but did not start until 11.50 and was completed by 12.15 and doors shut.

While we waited for boarding to be completed we were offered a glass of spicy buttermilk or coconut water. We were then given amenity kit, in the shape of a miniture suitcase. This was followed by head sets for in-flight entertainment and a sleeping suit. Slippers, a seat topper, sheet and a duvet where waiting for us in the storage space by our seats.

We were also given menus for the food options during the flight.

Drinks and food orders taken before take off, we went for the chicken option, Makhmali Methi Murg. The alternatives were red snapper and two vegetarian options, Saag Khumb Paneer and ricotta stuffed cannelloni.

The aircraft pushed back from the terminal at 12.35, on schedule and was airborne at 12.50. Our drinks were served shortly afterwards we a selection of heated nuts.

The Captain made an announcement, he introduced himself and informed us that the flight time would be around nine hours and forty minutes.

About fifty minutes into the flight they commented serving the food  there was plenty of it. The starters were either Chimichurri prawns or a feta tart, went for the tart.

This was followed by our chicken dish which was accompanied by ajwaini pulao, gajar marar, wadi wali dal and raita. Along with that there was a bread roll, slice of toasted garlic bread, a roti, paratha and a crispy poppadom. It was very tasty but no way could we eat it all.

We were offered a choice of wines, we stuck to the beer. We did not have any dessert as the trolley passed through the cabin.

Once the service was completed and cleared away, we prepared our seats to be converted in to flat beds ready for a snooze. The cabin lights were dimmed, duvet pulled up as the land of nod beckoned.
 
During the flight did visit the Galley to ask for two beers, they were served to our seats along with some snacks to munch on.

Roughly four hours since lunch the next service commenced and we we asked for our choices, we chose not to have any food. There was wide choice, once more, which included peppered prawns with noodles, murg kathi roll, or the two veg options of paneer stuffed tikka or cherry tomato pasta. Once more the portions were large. This was followed by a choice of tea or coffee. Once cleared in the cabin lights were dimmed again. 

Throughout the flight the Crew passed through the cabin with hot and cold towel.

With an hour to go the cabin lights were turned up so that passengers could prepare for landing.

We landed at 16.55, local time, which was thirty minutes earlier than scheduled, always good news.

It was an extremely comfortable flight, the service cannot be faulted. We were certainly well fed and watered.

Elina,  Cabin Supervisor really did look after us really well, she was charming, friendly and very efficient with a sense of humour. Was also impressed she always addressed us by our names, even as we disembarked the aircraft and thanked for flying Air India.

Upon reaching the airport, I was informed that the Bangalore -Delhi flight was delayed (okay, that happens), so they were transferring me to Air Vistara - which is now under the Air India (Tatas) umbrella. But, they said Air Vistara Business Class was running full, so they offered me Premium Economy. Okay, still understandable. This is a 2.5 hours flight, so I can manage, plus more importantly, I don't risk missing my connection to Newark. First Problem: Turns out the Air Vistara flight is also delayed! Secondly, they did not give me a lounge card, which I realised only after security check!. When I went to the lounge and explained what had happened, they flat out refused to give me access to the Air India/Vistara lounge at T2 in Bangalore. I tried explaining the entire sequence of events, but the staff at the Air India /Vistara (same lounge!) were unable to understand / too callous to help. And refused to permit me usage of the lounge! The lounge staff were unable to make a simple decision in spite of me showing my tickets and web check-in.  This was a horrible, horrible experience. I was really looking forward to this journey - my first by Air India after the Tatas takeover, but looks like the same old government run Air India.

"2023-12-07T18:17:42-05:00","1","review","1","Real INTERNATIONAL AIR INDIA EXPERIENCE ","The aircraft utilized for the flight appeared significantly aged, with various issues prevalent throughout. The meal trays were damaged, seat covers showed signs of wear and tear, and the meals were served in inexpensive, local takeout containers, which did not resonate well with the flight's international status. Additionally, the overhead bin unexpectedly opened during landing and taxiing, raising concerns about the overall maintenance.

Regarding the in-flight service, there were notable areas that require immediate attention and improvement. The cabin crew seemed inexperienced, demonstrating slow response times to passenger requests and a lack of attentiveness. Requests for assistance or simple amenities like water or drinks were either significantly delayed or went unattended, which contributed to an unsatisfactory travel experience.

The entertainment system onboard was subpar, with malfunctioning screens, unresponsive touch controls, and a severely limited selection of dated movies. The interface felt outdated, resembling technology from the early 2000s, and the crew's responsiveness to address these issues was lacking. Moreover, the announcement system suffered from technical glitches, with only the crew's noises audible and the speakers failing to relay crucial information to passengers effectively.

Considering Air India's status as India's primary airline representing the nation globally, there's a dire need for a comprehensive overhaul in their approach towards aircraft maintenance, passenger experience, and staff training. This is especially crucial for long international flights like the 14-hour journey from New York to Delhi. The lack of a welcoming atmosphere extended to the connecting flight from Delhi to Hyderabad, further emphasizing the need for a holistic improvement across the board to ensure a more satisfactory and welcoming travel experience for passengers."

This morning I got an email asking me to do a web check-in. The system then failed cos it is programmed to take you visa details (I hold a British Passport) as part of the check-in process (which I have never have come across with any other airlines) but this did not include the option for those holding an OCI.  So that was the end of it!!!!!!!!!!

So I thought I would call the call centre (UK number but obviously got someone in India) who basically told me that there was nothing he could do about it and that I  will just have to do all that when I got to Heathrow (though he apologised at least 10 times so at least the staff have been trained to show concern and some awareness that there processes are all ill thought out and when which was rarely the case when dealing with Indian Govt run Air India).  

Then I asked me if I can at least secure an aisle seat but that also was not possible unless I PAID for the selected seat (which is basically illegal as the Indian Supreme Court has ruled that paid seats should not be the only option when customers are doing an online check in: so much for the Tata group reputation of shunning sharp practises).  So that was that. 

This is on top of the fact that their planes are still pretty grotty and their in flight entertainment is never functional (based on SIX flights since the Tata's took over).  I only fly with them since they do a direct London-Ahmedabad flight; and can't wait till someone else start offering that non-stop option.  So best avoided till they they mature into a professionally run airline (like Emirates, maybe)."

Pros - 
Luggage allowance - 46kg - This was by far the best luggage allowance offered by an airline with no extra fee.
Reasonable cost - While it wasn't the cheapest in the list, it was at a reasonable cost of 40k.

Cons -
Sadly everything else was a con. Right from the staff behavior at CDG(Paris-Roissy) and the way the boarding was managed. didn't seem professional and upto international standard.
Next was the aircraft itself, outdated infotainment, broken display that never turned on despite several promises by the cabin crew after several passengers complained about the same. A nightmare of boredom for a 9-10 hour flight.
Food - The worst food I have had on an aircraft..ever! Defrosted meals that taste like cardboard. It was the first time ever I had to ditch the food for being inedible. A huge contrast to the amazing food they serve on domestic flights. Breakfast was decent because it was all packaged items.

Conclusion - If baggage is not your priority, skip Air India for any other flight even if they cost a little extra.

One of the major issues I encountered was the airline's deceptive charging practices related to baggage weight, which left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a passenger.

Upon reaching the check-in counter in Delhi, India, I was shocked to learn that Air India charges for the weight of my bag, hand carry, and even duty-free items purchased during the journey. This unexpected and undisclosed fee added a significant burden to my travel expenses, and it was disappointing to witness such a lack of transparency.

If Air India intends to charge passengers for the weight of every item they carry, including personal bags, hand luggage, and duty-free purchases, this information must be communicated clearly and prominently during the booking process. As a passenger, I believe in fair and transparent business practices, and the airline's failure to disclose these charges in advance raises serious concerns about the overall integrity of its services.

I strongly recommend that Air India review and revise its charging policies to ensure customers are well-informed and can make informed decisions about their travel expenses. I hope that this review serves as constructive feedback for the airline to improve its transparency and customer communication.

I had previously chosen Air India for my travels due to its reputation, but this experience has left me deeply disappointed. I urge potential passengers to be cautious and thoroughly review the airline's policies before making their travel arrangements.

It doesn't matter if you're the first customer to use..it's always there. The loos leak.

The loos are never cleaned in between flight. They are strewn with paper towels..mingled with leaky floors.

3. Food choice is really limited to veg/non veg. 

4. Teas and coffee are served cold. 

Want to play with emirates..step up the game

Air India allows 2 check in bags per passenger but I was allowed to carry only 1 bag per passenger and so I ended up paying $305.00 for one bag. The ticket had one bag but I talked to the representative and he told me that air India allows two bags and so they will honor that. A couple of my friends also gone and they took two bags with them.

I could not switch off the screen and the glare from it gave me a really bad headache throughout the whole flight. I politely expressed my concern to the flight attendant, but they did not care to bother! More or less, the tray table was broken, had foodstains ,and pockets had used napkins too! My hand rest was broken and taped together. The charging socket under the seat had chewing gum stuck and my charger had gum stuck to it when I took it out! This is extremely disgusting and shameful that the Airline does not have the basic standard of at least cleaning the flight and making sure their systems work before onboarding the next passengers!

When I cancelled, I immediately received a cancellation confirmation email from Air India confirm the flight was cancelled and I would receive a 100% refund for cancelling in a timely manner.
However, two weeks later, I had not received any refund. I reached out to Air India's customer service and they insisted I never cancelled the flight. I was passed between multiple representatives and finally told to create a Case. I did so, including all documentation, and followed up with Air India two more times. The second time, a representative confirmed I would receive a 100% refund within 24 hours. No refund ever came - I followed up multiple times, and never received any further responses other than insisting I cancel myself via their online portal, which would cost me $700 for a bogus cancellation fee.

I did nothing wrong in this scenario, and yet Air India is attempting to profit $700 from me, in nothing less than criminal fashion. DO NOT FLY WITH AIR INDIA."

This extended delay has been exacerbated by the fact that, upon every inquiry, I am provided with a standard response indicating a 15-day processing time. Regrettably, this timeline has proven to be far from accurate, and the lack of clarity surrounding the delay is causing immense dissatisfaction.

The continual delays in processing the refund have not only inconvenienced me but have also created financial strain as the original charge remains on my credit card statement. I had anticipated a more efficient and customer-centric resolution to this matter after moving to TATA, considering the substantial timeframe since my initial refund request.

What amazes me is that, while acknowledging the gravity of the problem, customer service representatives remain incredibly deceptive and continue to provide the same 14–15 day response time. I have already received this timeline four times, and I'm fairly certain that nothing will change by now, lesson learned is avoid Air india by any means"

Initially, I was worried if I would be able to make it with such short transit since I had to check out the bag and check in again, but the friendly staff reassured me by saying that they had stuck a priority tag to my checked bag so my bag would be checked out sooner. Due to unforeseen reasons, my first leg of the journey from London to Bombay was delayed by 40 minutes. The pilot sped the journey and covered for the lost time. However, again due to unforeseen reasons like not being able to get the steps cart to de-board the passengers we were delayed.

The staff at the Bombay airport was friendly. The people in Bombay were also friendly and allowed me to skip the immigration queue and get myself cleared first. The staff at security were also friendly. Finally, I made it to the boarding gate 20 minutes before the Gates opened.

As an apology note for the delay in the first flight, they upgraded my economy ticket to business class. It was my business class on a flight. It was a nice experience.

Goes without saying, the food was amazing. 
I boarded the flight in the afternoon with chicken korma, rice, green peas and spinach. For dinner, I was served with aloo parotta and kala chenna. For breakfast I had a choice of menu (since i was flying business), I choose healthy ragi idly. I was also given complimentary drink of choice (my choice being coconut water), fruit salad etc... 

Overall, there were things that could be done better like managing time efficiently, some faulty tv buttons could have been fixed etc...

but the timing of the flight was very convenient, every other airline I had to be at the airport in midnight etc..

At the end of the day, it took me safely from one destination to another. They fed me well, that is more than happy for a simple-minded woman like me.

#airindia #hydraulicleak #systemfailure #neverflyairindia

Dubai to Mumbai flight AI 984 was suppose to fly on 17/11/23 at 23:40 hrs and land on 18/11/23 at 04:15 hrs 

All passengers were boarded on time. Gates were closed at 23:30hrs and flight started taxing but then comes the announcement about the craft failure, a major hydraulic leak. What next? Was a common question by each passenger. Of course there was no answer as it was too early to say anything. Everyone cooperated and understood the situation.

After 2hours long wait in the flight, there was another announcement that the engineer said it’s a major failure, plane can’t be flown and has to be lifted to a remote location in order to fix it. Passenger were asked to walk out of the plane until further notice and follow the instructions of the ground staff. Economy passengers were asked to wait at McDonald’s lounge and we were among the first few people to reach there. We waited another hour for further information but there was no staff seen anywhere around to answer our questions. And we started to suspect that something is really wrong. 

Me (On tourist visa) and my brother (Dubai resident) started looking for Airindia staff and started calling the customer care. Couldn’t find anyone to answer us. Airindia customer care said that the flight has already flown as per their records. Then we searched for connection counter where our other fellow passengers were desperately waiting for an answer. This took another hour to reach at the counter and have a conversation with Airindia staff. Shockingly, Air India staff had no answer, no arrangements, no accommodation after 4-5 hours of flight failure. It was a mess people on people, shouting, yelling and was getting frustrated with AirIndia’s mishandling. We were all stuck since we didn’t know what to do especially as I tourist as I had crossed immigration now I can’t even cross back immigration to enter Dubai. I tried to explain my situation and asked the following valid questions: what action AirIndia is taking? Are they going to get another craft or going to fly this craft after repair? Is this flight delayed or totally cancelled ? How will we reach to our destination, Mumbai? How will I cross back immigration at Dubai if we are not flying to Mumbai? There was no answer to any of the above questions. They said we have no information from higher authorities and we can’t do anything in this. We can’t offer another flight nor we are expecting another craft. 

Finally, we searched and reached to the Dubai immigration office near connection counter at Departures. We explained the whole situation and fortunately they understood our situation and extended hand of help. We were sent back from Departure to arrivals to further discuss our case with arrival’s immigration. With the support and understanding of Dubai immigration officers, I was taken back in Dubai. And I am thankful that my brother is a Dubai resident and had a home to go. 

It is a shame and insult that our national flight left us helpless in this situation whereas Dubai administration helped us in every way. 

It’s high time AirIndia.

Very annoying experience. Yesterday, I called on Toll free number 01242641407 number to book extra 1 piece of luggage of 23kg throughout the journey . I spoke to  priya and had a Pathetic experience. please do check call recordings without fail about your teachings of misguiding customer and unsatisfied customer service experience . Priya is very much trained to misguide customers. Though, I repeated and reconfirmed several times with her that I want to book 1 piece of 23kg (very clearly 5 - 6 times) she booked me for 9kg extra luggage and took the payment. I asked her that the mail that i received nowhere it's written that I am allowed 23Kg please see I don't want unnecessary hassle at the airport and she assured me again it's 23kg only and disconnected call though I was talking to her and didn't felt like respond back or call back. What should I say to this kind of service, I don't know. 
More surprise, I called again on toll free number and Rohini picked up she gave me another surprise that you are booked for 9kg excess luggage. She helped me as possible she can but, I am really disappointed that she doesn't provided with enough authority to take decision to satisfy customer with the genuine request. This is something annoying and unacceptable. She cancelled my 9kg excess luggage that was booked due to mistake of priya but she doesn't have system to share a mail that I will get full refund, it's cancelled. Also, I requested her if she can take the additional whatever extra amount and rather that refund adjust my this amount but she mentioned system doesn't allow. (What kind of system you have) Then I requested her to give me in written that if I do booking now as she is mentioning now for 23kg extra piece throughout my connected flight and I will pay for this, she refused that she isn't authorized to give that in written and also airline don't give this in written( this is something weird & not acceptable answer. My earlier paid money got stuck with you. God knows when I will get my full refund but I have recorded Rohini's words. It's really pathetic and third class customer service you are having that you can't share a mail  and even can't give a cancellation and refund mail This is a huge glitch from your end correct this take some action. 

Unsatisfied with Air India, as I am aware it's with Tata now didn't expected such kind of services.

This is very much clear that you are teaching your employees to cheat the customers and definitely if you can't give in written that mean a big mess  is going on in your backend system.

Listen to the recordings: you will understand that I was having a genuine requests and you didn't provided me with that, moreover train your staff customers are not having a tree of money to give you."

I came to the lounge and the lady at the lounge showed me that my boarding passes were economy although the seats were business and I was not carrying the lounge card. After some huddle, she allowed me to get in, but it left a bad taste as clearly, the all-around activities seem to be very amateurish and clearly lack of training.

"2023-10-27T08:04:33-04:00","2","review","0","Air India 13/10","On first glance, the plane looked outdated due to the colours of the seats. (orange/yellow with hints of brown at the seams) and the occasional red seat between. The aisle were really narrow and I was having to walk sideways throughout the flight and others who would walk the right way round would bump into my shoulder repeatedly. 

During takeoff and landing the over head compartment opened which was dangerous as a heavy suitcase or something could have fallen and cause injury.

Entertainment was mediocre and it would be good to have a selection of games to play as a part of the entertainment, also the flight map didn’t seem to have a map, which would be a nice addition. The headphones could be improved as they had a static sound and hurt my ears. 

Food. Where do we begin with the food, in meal 1, clearly no Indian influence was put into the daal because my daal was solid not runny, the rice had a jasmine taste which was quite nice and I got a cardamon my rice (elachi) paneer was edible but it wasn’t something I would have again. The choley (chickpeas) were stale, ice cold, and soggy. The bread and butter was good it does what it said on the tin, and the cheesecake was lovely. 

Between meals they provided crunchy corn which was sour cream and chive, which were a very nice touch and we did ask for more. Also between meals they provided drink which they only filled halfway which was frustrating because we had to ask for more and once the 2 sips were finished we weren’t allow to throw our rubbish in the bin and when we asked they said they will come around. We think that’s rubbish because our tiny tray tables were full. However there was a wide selection of drinks including, Pepsi and Coca Cola, as well as alcoholic beverages. But when ordering a coke and vodka they were stingy with the coke. 

Meal 2 (both our meals are the vegetarian option, however I do eat meat) the vegetable samosa was not a samosa which again reiterates what I mean by no Indian influence because there was no pastry in the samosa. The “pastry” was so thick we couldn’t get through to see what’s inside. The orange juice was average and it’s from concentrates. The water was smooth. And the Bundi and Bhujia was stale however I found it the best thing in that meal. The cutlery was wood. 

The staff was mixed, some people looked like they like their job some people looked like they were forced to do they work, and when we asked what the meals were and other questions they would reply with “I don’t know”.

The toilets were getting progressively dirtier throughout the flight, at the beginning, clean, fresh and nice, however towards the end the toilet was flooded with water, wet tissue all over the floor and wee all over the seat. The toilets should be regularly cleaned on a longer flight. 

In conclusion, I would use this flight as a last resort however we survived.

To begin with, they delayed our flights to Delhi by 6 hours on the outbound journey and by 9 hours on the return, all with less than 24 hours' notice. The return delay had a significant ripple effect on a separate, unrelated flight, yet the airline's customer service refused to acknowledge or address the issue in any meaningful way.

At the Delhi airport, the check-in process was nothing short of a nightmare. They attempted to charge my companion and me an additional $400 USD each for a carry-on bag, claiming it wasn't included in our fare. Oddly, I had no issues with this on the outbound flight when I carried the same bag onboard. I strongly suspect they were attempting to take advantage of us, as they suddenly allowed us to check in without any extra charges as soon as I mentioned contacting the US Embassy.

While the seats were not comfortable, they were at least tolerable for a 16-hour flight. However, the in-flight entertainment systems were malfunctioning, so it's advisable to have your own entertainment options prepared if you decide to travel with this airline."

We all flew business class from Newark to Bombay the comfort, the legroom, and the cleanliness was unspeakable. However, the food I was very highly dissatisfied with. They started our journey with cold baba ghanouj, and cold hummus with hard bread. I would like to say as I looked around 65% of passengers were elderly. That as a starter no one seemed to enjoy. Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was.  An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer.After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid  so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset. Finally towards our landing, we were served frozen chat and a “veg grilled sandwich” which was in fact only bread and cold squash in it. It was making me vomiting because it was so bitter and tasted slimy and tasteless. The whole food experience was disgusting, I wish I could have at least one good item, the desserts were cold and too sweet to eat.

Cant imagine missing the last flight of the day, with lots of work planned for the next day.  Luckily I got a ticket in 4 am Indigo flight and landed at cochin at 6 am , after  a sleepless night with the help of Air India staff.
I thankfully remember the services of the staff members of Indigo, Spicejet and vistara earlier in similar situations. Indigo staff once accompanied me till security check with my baggage and cleared  everything in few minutes and boarded me with my to be checked in  baggage ( as I was so late) on a very busy day at Delhi airport.
Air India staff still thinks and behaves like a lazy government employee and treats customers as slaves. They somehow want to take home their salary. 
Not Tata, even God will find it difficult to save Air India

"2023-10-21T09:18:01-04:00","1","review","0","Worst Airline","My third experience with Air India post-Tata takeover has been a complete nightmare. In April 2022, my first flight was a letdown with no in-flight entertainment, no meal preferences, and an ancient aircraft that felt like it could fall apart any moment.

In December 2022, my second flight was a slight improvement with meal preferences acknowledged and timely departures, but the absence of in-flight entertainment remained a disappointment.

Now, in October 2023, my third and likely final experience was a disaster. The flight from San Francisco to Delhi was delayed by 3 hours without any prior notice. Luggage mix-ups added another 2+ hours of delay. We reached Delhi over 6 hours past the scheduled time, with no compensation for our ordeal. At the Delhi gate, we were charged extra for exceeding the carry-on weight limit, including jackets and laptops. We were too exhausted to argue.

The only positive change was the new Boeing 777-200LR aircraft. I've traveled for over 8 years with 25+ legs on various airlines, and I've never encountered such a cunning attempt to extort money from passengers. When I sought compensation for the delay, Air India didn't bother to respond. This delay wasn't an isolated incident; Air India flights were consistently delayed throughout the month, as reported by friends.

Air India has regressed to its old reputation of delayed flights and poor customer service. I have no intention of booking another flight with them."

There was plenty of legroom and the flight attendants provided us with blankets and pillows during the flight, however, the blankets were not comfortable. They might cause a rash your skin, but the pillows and all the other amenities provided in economy were perfectly fine. 

During my flight, my tv screen in front of my seat was broken and couldn't function. Most of the chairs and the interior were unfurnished and outdated. There was also a lot of dirt inside the charging cables and the remotes to the tv screen couldn't even work. so I moved seats and tried another tv screen but whenever I pressed a movie (touchscreen) IT wouldn't work. Terrible! I highly recommend you to bring a device with movies downloaded. 

Food was actually mid. I ordered a veg jain meal (Im not jain) and the cooks have prepared it in an amazing way. It was very nice and filling. 

For the prices, it's highly recommended that you should fly with Air India because the prices are very cheap. Most of the technological ammenities won't work but the international seats have good comfort and the food is good. "

"2023-10-17T22:10:42-04:00","1","review","1","Travel experience "," would like to share my recent encounter with Air India, which I once again found to be quite disappointing after my earlier expeience from Chicago to Delhi. As someone deeply immersed in the hospitality industry, responsible for managing some of the most luxurious operations globally, I travel extensively and cannot see these things for granted. During my travels, I've had the privilege of experiencing the highest service standards provided by competitor airlines in the Middle East and Asia.

However, my recent Air India experience left much to be desired and was overwhelmingly disappointing, once again. It's frustrating to note that despite raising my concerns with the cabin crew, there appeared to be a lack of proactive actions taken to address the issues I encountered. It's important to emphasize that I am a paying passenger, not a complimentary guest.

One of the significant issues I encountered was the absence of basic customer service from the cabin crew oor passion for their job. For example, when I requested Chamomile tea, the response was a flat ""NO.""

Here are my observations, and I sincerely hope that my feedback is taken seriously, as I can assure you I won't be flying with Air India anymore:

1. Once again, the entire entertainment system was non-functional for the entire flight, and the explanation given was repetitive system reboots. It's hard to believe that the system needs constant reboots during a 14-hour flight.

2. We were served one round of drinks, and when we asked for a refill after 30 minutes, we were informed that they could only serve after one hour, but nobody showed up afterwards or even when i asked they did not return. It was perplexing that, despite the flight's duration, there was no drink service during dinner.

3. Only black tea was available, with no variety.

4. The seats were dirty, and the fabric was so soiled that it was off-putting.

5. The cabin crew exhibited a lack of attentive service, consistently responding with ""NO"" rather than attempting to accommodate requests.

6. The dinner menu was disappointing, with the chicken dish being overly spicy, the salad lacking dressing, and the chocolate mousse being unappetizing.

7. The combination of Indian, Chinese, and Italian dishes ( Aloo chat, Chinese noodles, Panna Cotta) on the same tray, including cold, spicy and inedible cold noodles, was a poor choice. Despite requesting beverages, they were not provided, and the cabin crew ignored our requests.

8. The toilets were unsanitary, displaying signs of negligence and no maintenance. No one refilled the toilet paper even after telling the cabin crew that toilets require immediate attention.

9. The dining table was dirty and broken, and the floor was not cleaned before new passengers arrived on the plane.

10. Stone-cold Kathi rolls were served, which were inedible. When I asked for coffee, the response was another ""NO,"" and the coffee never materialized.

It is clear that the cabin crew requires meticulous training in customer service. Consider sending them for training at established airlines like Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways, or Emirates to acquire basic etiquette for looking after customers and delivering exceptional service experiences.

With Tata's takeover of Air India, I hope to witness positive changes and improvements in the airline's services. This marks my second disappointing experience after a flight from Chicago to Delhi. Frankly, this level of service is unacceptable."

"2023-10-14T11:28:47-04:00","3","review","0","Wasn't the worst but definitely not the best flying experience.","Have been on it before and after TATA acquired it and both times were ok at best and uncomfortable at worst. 

First, the seats were too narrow. If I had to only sit for 3-4 hrs max then I wouldn't have complained but sitting 15+ hrs in a narrow sit like that is just really uncomfortable and even painful for me since I experience both back and leg problems.

Second, the food. When we (mom and I) had booked our flight we also selected our preferred meal options (we both selected vegetarian but I eat chicken sometimes) but on the flight there were no special meals. We were given the option for veg or non-veg, I selected non-veg (It was chicken) and my mom got the veg option for the snack. The snack I had gotten was great but my mom's was a mess and kept dripping on her and stained her clothes. she said it didn't taste very good. and during both lunch and dinner we both chose the veg option, it was just ok, maybe a bit bland if nothing else.

Third, leg space. Very little honestly, we were sitting in the front row and it still felt tight. 
 
Fourth, the service. I don't personally like to talk like this, I've worked in the service industry myself, but it wasn't very good. I can understand if the crew were tired and even then they were still polite.

For anyone reading this, get a business class seat if you want to be comfy tbh especially if you're flying for more than 10 hrs and the food was ok but could be better. "

Unfortunately, we arrived late at the airport, causing us to miss our scheduled flight to Mumbai. Faced with this unexpected situation, we approached Mr. Gokhle, the head of Air India's ground staff, and shared our predicament. This trip was particularly significant for us as it marked our first journey after the COVID-19 pandemic, and we needed to attend a wedding.

In just a matter of minutes, Mr. Gokhle and his dedicated team sprang into action and devised a new travel plan for us. They displayed an eagerness to assist us and went above and beyond to ensure our journey proceeded smoothly. The revised itinerary involved taking a flight from San Francisco to Delhi and then connecting to Mumbai.

Remarkably, within a mere 30 minutes, we found ourselves on board the flight to Delhi. The efforts of Mr. Gokhle and his team transformed what could have been a stressful and disheartening experience into an easy, memorable, and joyous journey.

The ground staff at Air India exhibited exceptional politeness and helpfulness throughout this ordeal. They were always ready and willing to assist us in the best way possible, ensuring that our travel experience remained positive and stress-free.

Imagine my plight having to spend the entire time staring at others screens or trying my best to sleep when I cant. Well that's exactly what I had to do as the inflight entertainment system never worked during the flight duration. Initial complaints to the crew led to the similar response of ""resetting"" the system.  But not a single time did the crew come back and check as they were obviously aware that the system had a problem. I am not the only one who was suffering as I could see many other screens blank at various points of time during the flight, including public announcement by the pilot that the entertainment system was being restarted. Anyways, if the entertainment system was faulty then it was just a tip of the iceberg as far as Air India's services go. Water served was in a small cup, juice served was half the cup...I can go on with the complete lack of services on board. Once i reached India, I promptly reported the matter on the Air India portal. While I got an immediate auto response, the next response didn't come for the next 2 weeks. Persistent follow ups from me with copies to the Nodal office and the Appellate authority, finally woke up the grievance  team to just about inform me that they needed more time!! Its been 1.5 months since the ordeal, till date I haven't received a proper response from the grievance team, the nodal officer or the Appellate authority. In the meanwhile, during one of the follow ups, I got an offer to credit my account with a few points that could be used against future bookings. This offer was obviously not acceptable to me as I don't intend to step on another Air India flight. Also, while I paid for the flight in GBP ( as no other option was provided) the so called compensation was in INR (that too in some form of points).
I continue to pursue the Appellate Authority. But what I can confirm to everyone reading this review is that the airline may change colors and the logo, but the cultural issues runs deep. When I mean cultural, I mean apathy to customers!!
Stay away from the airline and save money and peace of mind..."

I have been a regular customer of AIR INDIA for many years but recently there have been frequent issues of inflight screens not working. I filed a refund claim on 29 July 2023 with all proofs and my claim is still pending. Either I receive automated emails from Air India saying they are working on my case or else my emails are being ignored for the past 2 months.

Air India. Don't use Air India if you want to reach your destination on time. For my case I have to spend 3days in the airport. The Airport staff all telling lies and never provide details about the flight. Flights like Air India need to be banned flying from UK.

Being full fee paid Business class passengers we had all the privileges one could expect. As part of Star Alliance we could choose the lounge in Heathrow, none of them were  very great. The plane took off and landed on time and flight was smooth and uneventful. The planes inside was same as before, dated and not clean or well kept. Some TV screens were working with very limited choice of contents. The free goodies included TUMI nightwear which many people didn't want. The cabin staff were overtly friendly and obliging compared to more luxury airlines like Emirates and Qatar airways. Food was as expected of good quality and and choice was abundant. If you like alcohol, there is plenty including Champagne. The Adani Lounge in Mumbai was over crowded often difficult to find a seat. There was plenty of nice places to sit down in the main airport lounge which I chose eventually. I know Air India is transforming after TATA takeover, but they can still make the cabin conditions clean and pleasant while waiting for new aircrafts to be introduced."

 It was an 8-hour flight and almost all seats were broken (38a, 39a, 39b, 40a, 40b, 40c, emergency exit, 32, cabin crew).
I was assigned 38a which was broken (ref video) and when I raised the concern to the cabin crew Kavita, she suggested that I sit on the broken seat but during take off and landing CAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE RISK ISSUES, they will assign me a different seat.
I refused to sit on the broken seat and requested for a different seat (check videos attached) because it was going to be a long flight and wouldn’t be good for my back and worthy of risking my life in case of an emergency.
Then the RUDEST commercial officer “Saket” came and said ‘I don’t have seats you can get off the plane and figure out what you want to do’. The plane was running late by almost 2 hours and he said he needs to quickly close the gates. Part of conversation is in the videos attached.
Then Reena Rai, the supervisor came to whom I explained the whole issue again including the fact how rude Saket was and I was assigned 39a but it was broken too (ref video attached). 
Finally, I was assigned cabin crew seats which were broken too. Attached videos and photos capture the broken seats, recliners, remotes, handles etc.
For 8 hours there was no comfort, cause the seats were broken & no entertainment cause the remotes were broken. I have never had such an awful experience with AI and or any other flight. The customer service, etiquette & EQ of AI staff and crew has degraded beyond the lowest level. 

I really wish to attach the videos that I have taken but unfortunately I can only attach photos."

Our travel began with a 30 minute delay, due to the plane needing to be cleaned, which set the tone for the rest of our journey. 
Once we boarded the flight, it was clear there was an issue with the onboard entertainment system. After speaking to the crew supervisor, he rebooted my system three times, with no luck and stated he would try and move my sister and myself to other available seats where the entertainment was working. 
Once food was served i discovered my table was also broken. To add to the problems, my recliner was also not working. I once again spoke to a member of the crew to inform them of my issues and was shocked when they stated that 50% of the screens on the flight did not work but they would try and assist me after serving everyone's food. 
Following this i spoke to 3 separate members of staff over the next 2 hours, i was informed that only the crew supervisor could assist me. I then proceeded to wait 2 hours to speak to him, and every time i asked a member of staff they stated they would ""call him"". 
An hour later the supervisor did come and speak to me, and once he had checked that everything was broken to his satisfaction he went to look for somewhere for us to move to. He returned 10minutes later stating there was nowhere for myself and my sister to move to in economy and after mumbling something and checking upfront, he rushed back behind the curtains to premium and business class. 20 minutes later he came back to tell me all he could offer me was a seat with extra leg room, where the chair did recline but the screen didnt work. When i queered to being moved to premium economy, (keeping in mind th3 dinner meal had already been served, so the onyl benefit would be the seat) he explaineed that the captain would not permit it as my screen was not the only one to be having issues. However he assured me that if it was only my screen  that was having issues alongside the other problems with my chair he would have been able to upgrade me. 
The supervisor was particularly friendly and seemed nice enough but i did not find him helpful. 

Overall my experience with air india was absolutely awful. As i was hoping for a nice restful flight, with the bare minimum, to prepare for my difficult week ahead but that was not to be. 
I am dreading the flight back!"

Their in flight entertainment system is invariably faulty, the screens don't work and neither do usb ports 9r plug points and on most flights we have spent at least 3 hours of the journey without it being fixed or functional. With it needing a reboot every so often. 

The crew don't seem to appreciate people trying to nap or doze, waking us up tp offer tea or coffee. Some are so grumpy and roll trolleys at 20 miles an hour and don't have a cheerful temperament to serve with a smile. Its like they are doing the passengers a favour.

When I reached Delhi it was 4Pm and my next flight to Ny was at 2:45AM. To my surprise the Delhi airport customs doesn’t allow us with a reason ‘you can enter only when its 3hrs from our boarding time’. They don’t allow if your boarding time more than 3 hrs. There so many international people and old people  just sitting on the chairs and sleeping. Only 2 vending machines one of them was broke. Only one small cafeteria with limited options. And you cannot go out side the airport to buy some food. Seriously this is the worst. 
For 8hrs every one we’re sitting in the worst comfortable chairs and with limited facilities. And what is the use of having lounges after the security check when the actual people who want to use them are waiting in the lobby. 

Firstly it’s air India’s responsibility to at least provide refreshments to the passengers who has this big layovers in Delhi. When it comes to big layovers, Air India should at least let us know. Don’t even think of going to air India help desk- they have a very bad attitude and doesn’t even try to help. 

Secondly, I understand the Delhi airport cannot accommodate that huge crowd- so the airport should be renovated to accommodate the bigger crowd. It’s the capital of The India.

Due to some delay at SFO, I had landed in India 1.5 hours late and really had to hurry for connecting flight. Worst part is going back to SFO flight from Delhi that got delayed due to technical issues indefinitely only 5mins before scheduled departure they announce. They keep changing the time every 2-4 hours. Everyone is suffering in airport only. There is no compensation and no hotel or lounge provided. Staff keep rotating but telling same story of another time slot. I understand the company financial situation, but not keeping customer informed proactively makes the genuine solution they attempt look very falsely and untrustworthy. Good luck for anyone flying Air India, perhaps this is going yo be my family's last attempt."

At the arrival in Paris, they literally refused to help me to find a solution for an hotel or at least somewhere to spend the night and a solution for the day after.
After multiple exchanges by emails they also refused to compensate me for extra expenses in Paris even if it was not a lot knowing I found a super late solution with a friend in Paris.
The customer service doesn't care at all about their passengers, the most important is to make money for a really poor service in general.
This is literally the worst company I have taken in my life and for sure it would be the last one, the service is absolutely unacceptable for the price paid"

I was supposed to board the flight from London on 15th Aug at 12:15 PM scheduled for departure at 1:15 PM. I already did check-in (tagged my bags and collected my boarding pass) well before time and just had to do our baggage drop at the counter. It was still 2 minutes left for the baggage counter closure at 12:13 PM but the lady on the Air India baggage counter D19 denied to take the bag saying that I am late and the counter is closed now. I am an old age senior citizen of India and it was really inconvenient for me to run around the airport for help specially with our non-helping fellow Indian executives behaving rudely. The girl spoke very loudly to me saying that her shift is over now and straight asked me to cancel the current check in and rebook the ticket. Is this some scripted stunt by Air India specially when we are striving to travel country to attend an Independence day function? I requested her very politely for help but there wasn't even an effort for help. She rudely asked me to go to Ticket Counter and when I did,Air India executive asked me to cancel my current check in and pay late fees (saying that I have to show as if I didn't turn up for the flight and came just before the flight take off) and then pay additional fee for reschedule. It was a hefty amount of £200 that was charged from me in addition to take another flight.
It's a big shame on the Air India service!!"

The next day they informed us that the plane would leave at 16 (this too will have a delay) but this would only take us to Delhi, there wasn't the rest of the trip. This goes against Indian immigration laws as no ones had a VISA... but they didn't care about this and neither that we paid for a trip to Bangkok.
We reached our destination 24 HOURS DELAY only thanks to Malpensa operators who have found a seat on a flight with ANOTHER COMPANY. Air India therefore did not provide me with the service for which I paid more than 1,200 euros.
In addition to the immense delay and the proposal to abandon 150 paying people midway in violation of immigration laws, I would like to point out:
* total disorganization in everything (they announce the hotel at 2am, we'll touch the bed at 6am - they make us load our suitcases on the bus and then let us off because there wasn't enough space in that hotel - they make us go back to the airport without first organizing how to distribute passengers on other flights). The two Indian managers on duty on August 6, 2023 at Malpensa, a man and a woman, are the greatest demonstration of incapacity, uselessness and inefficiency I have ever seen.
* Continuous lies denied even by the airport ground staff, who scold them in front of passengers for these shameless lies
* Lack of assistance - the day after departure, while the ground staff were looking for a solution, nobody from AirIndia was present as well as they didn't even offer us ONE CHAIR.
* Racism - the two useless managers were only concerned with managing the Indian passengers who in fact, magically, were the only ones who knew about the buses to the hotel and had reached them hours earlier. In addition, they were worried only to reach Delhi.
Air india has handled hundreds of passengers including elderly and children like animals...air india deserves bankruptcy and license revocation"

"2023-08-06T15:06:18-04:00","2","review","0","Broken service in a broken aircraft!!","1. Old aircraft with broken screens, seats, reading lamps, call buttons etc.
It seems AI does zero or very limited maintenance on their aircrafts. The broken condition of the AI aircraft was reported by a family member in Sep 2022. I observed similar or worst condition of the aircraft even in July 2023, which confirms AI is not interested in passenger safety and comfort even for their long haul flights like 16hour DEL-SFO flights. Entertainment console screens are broken, seats are in bad shape, reading lamps, call buttons even the screen which the crew checks from where the call button came from (there is a separate screen in the rear where the call came from) also does not work.

2. Limited services from the air hostesses.
The crew serves the food with an attitude, like ""take what we give and nothing more"". Simple example, while serving the meal they didn't ask what drinks or juice u want, they just serve what they had in hand. It's not that they don't have varieties, but that's too much work to offer to a passenger even though the aircraft have varieties of juices available to be served. When asked the answer was, Oh I have go and get it and it never came :).

3. Non working air hostesses in long haul flights
For a 16 hour long haul flights AI servers two main meals and a mini meal. The air hostesses are naturally busy during this time which normally takes 30-45 minutes, take it as an hour. That's 3 hours of very busy time and they also work in shifts so one batch can work while others take rest. All these are understandable, but during the extra 12+ hours can't they do something that's helpful for the passengers? Like once in two hours walk around to take up coffee cups, water bottles, take used trays? Also they can walk around and offer water, juices coffee etc for the passengers. It all about the the service attitude of these stewardess. Instead I have seen many times these stewardesses are sitting idle talking for hours whereas the passenger aisles are dirty with packet wrappers all around. If they walk around occasionally with cleanup bags, passengers will surely clean up the area and overall the aircraft will be less dirty for all other future passengers as well as for the crew.

Again it's all about the protocols of the airline and the attitude of the stewardesses. 

4. Amenities
In AI one can't expect any amenities for a passenger in the cabin or in the lavatories. No eye or ear blockers for sleep, no tooth brush paste, comb etc in the toilet etc etc. all empty washrooms with just the napkins, soap.

5. Air hostesses lock-up a washroom for personal usage within themselves?!!
Yes, you heard it right. I have seen the air hostesses serving in the rear end AI 173 DEL-SFO on July 24th morning were locking up a washroom just for their usage and not open to the public. Whenever I visited the backend of the aircraft I found the washroom on the rear RHS was locked and not available. I stood there for a while and then I found the air hostesses unlock the door by lifting a metal plate, she entered, used it for a while came out and locked it again. Later I asked why she locked it after her use? She said since the water pressure was low she was told by her superior to lock it. If that is the case why did she and her colleagues use it? Don't they require water? After I complained about it I found the washroom was opened to the public. So it is clearly one of the washrooms were kept locked from the public for exclusive air hostesses usage!! I haven't seen anything like these on the numerous air lines I have flown in all these years. AI for sure seems sets a standard here!!

5. Quarter cup of coffee served during meals. What's wrong with these people?
At the outset, I'm not an avid or frequent coffee drinker. It's surprising to see the coffee served during meals is close to a quarter cup!! I can understand it may spill if they service a full cup to the brim. But this is way too less!! The quantity is small quarter cup. It seems like if they serve more, they'll ran out of coffee and they have to make it again, which is huge responsibility!! The attitude in serving meals is just pathetic!! Check the attached photos for references. 

It's one thing getting a newer aircraft to fix a broken hardware but that will not change the attitude of the crew or protocols of an airline!! For the people who train these stewardesses (if there is a training team :) ), trainers need to travel in other airlines running in this sector and observe what other airlines offer for their customers in the economy class. I had seen many other airlines in that sector, when attempting to use washroom, the air hostesses ask you to wait for a moment, check the washroom, make it clean, sanitize and spray refresher and then ask you to use it. This happens in intervals before the washroom gets too dirty and clogged. Some of these can be easily adopted by AI w/o incurring additional costs

At least the least they can do with incurring additional costs is to change the job description of the stewardesses to include regular walk around in the zone of their responsibility, clean debris, service water, juices, coffee, to passengers, make avail of snacks, coffee, juices in the kitchen.

For all these inconveniences, I have to mention that the price is the lowest, during the peak season. But limiting courtesy and services should not be cost cutting reason for low fare. AI can still excel if they provide reasonable services within the aircraft for these long haul flights. 

When will AI change its attitude towards a customer, a passenger or treat as human beings?!! I doubt it will, since it's in their vein, working for a public sector company and all these as mentioned above will alienate frequent passengers for sometime!!"

Flight was 5hrs late from BHX because crew were overworked and demanded rest. Flight arrived 4.3hrs late in DEL. I missed by connecting Air India flight by 40mins- next flight was 6hrs later  21.15.

Now the process to claim compensation  was an exercise in ignoring me march 2023.  I've called over 20times , emailed over 10 times, opened 5 complaint cases.  I was even given a false number to call at BHX and the real numbers were never picked up.  Cases were just ignored and closed. Requests to speak to a senior manager were ignored, twice their call centre even hung up on me!

All when others on the same initial flight have already received compensation.

They even had other peoples cases on my list, where I could their names and money owed to them - interesting IT system...

I then requested my personal data from them twice....that has so far been ignored...

My only option is to circulate my experience on as many social media sites as possible.  They owe me €600 and whole host of apologies. Absolutely disgusted at the lack of respect and customer service. In my opinion, avoid them at all costs.  "

They broke my bag which was in mint condition and are refusing to pay the actual cost for the bag. Their baggage claim staff is the most unprofessional staff.

This was the last time that I travelled with Air India. Me and all of my family members are going to stay away from this airline forever. And yes I am looking forward to escalate this matter to the highest level."
"2023-07-24T07:33:34-04:00","1","review","1","Avoid at all costs!","This was the worst experience I‘ve ever had with an airline. 

The tldr: 10h delay without any meaningful compensation (which happens regularly according to locals due to bad management), staff ignoring me and lying to me, families with little kids having to wait 5+ hours without food or water, passengers not being informed about what’s happening, generally just inacceptable behaviour for an international airline. To top it off, ancient in-flight entertainment that did not work and unmotivated service staff that at times even was rude.

The whole story:
We received a message at 5 in the morning the day of our departure that our connecting flight was going to be delayed 7 hours. At our starting airport in Singapore nobody of Air Indias staff was able to tell us why this was happening, and they recommended us asking in our layover in Delhi. In Delhi, we were brought to a Transfer counter where the staff wanted to give us some food and call it solved. 
As we had an important event that we were going to miss, we persisted that we wanted to know the reason for the delay and to either be changed to a different, earlier flight or to be compensated accordingly. This was met with ignorance first, telling us to wait and letting us sit for an hour. 
At this point, we had noticed that several other people, including families with kids also had the same problem, with some missing connecting flights or hotels and wanting compensation. The new arrival time of 1:30 in the morning caused some to not have any option but to wait at the destination airport for hours until the first transportation started going again. Even despite to there being little kids, the staff proceeded to ignore us and handle other passengers first for another half hour.
After that, we were able to ask one staff to at least give us the reason for the delay, which he first did not want to say, but then started saying something like „it could be anything“ and finally, under more pressing from us, he obviously lied to us just saying „technical difficulties“ and left. 
We continued talking to the remaining staff and being ignored, with everyone including the families already having waited without food or water for two hours. Together with the others that had the same problem, we started researching what compensation we were eligible to have, and found that usually, due to the length of our flight and the amount of delay, we should be getting 400-600€ in compensations.
Only when we showed this to the transfer staff, they first started noticing us and taking action. The guy said his manager told him he could not give compensation, so we told him we wanted to speak to the manager. He let us wait another 30 minutes before we asked again and he sait the manager decided not to come. After once more pressing our right for compensation, threatening to use agencies to legally get it for us, and showing him how much money that would amount to with the 15 people that we already were, he finally gave in and said he could give us hotel rooms at the airport. This was after 4 hours of negotiations and with only 5 hours left before the delayed connecting flight, but we gave in and accepted.
It took the staff and the manager - who arrived after all now that it was about money - another three quarters of an hour to figure out how many rooms we needed, before finally leading us to the hotel. There we had to wait another 45 minutes as the hotel staff first did not want to accept us getting free rooms and took ages with the check-in.
After all this, we had about two hours left before our connecting flight - so half an hour to eat, half an hour to shower, and not quite an hour of sleep in our new hotel rooms. 
The free food turned out to be a „buffet“ which could not look more sad, and was really not good (and inacceptable compared to other airlines that usually give vouchers that you can use in every shop on the airport), and no drinks were included apart from 250ml of water (which you can get at water dispensers in Delhi’s airport food court for free). 

At this point we were just happy to go home and forget about everything, but it turned out this was not yet the end.

When arriving at the gate and waiting for boarding, we noticed some turmoil going on on the entrance to the gate.
After asking some locals we found out that the Air India staff had informed some of them in Hindi that there was an issue with the plane‘s engine and we might be further delayed by another 9 hours, to 6 in the next morning. No announcement over the PA was made, and we would never have found out without the helpful locals that had the same experience as we did.
One even told us that it was normal for the airline to delay flights 7 or more hours to combine them with the next one if there were too few passengers, and that flights just being pushed to the next day was the usual due to Air India‘s bad management - and he usually only got back 50% of what he paid in vouchers.
This is where the locals started to have enough and got really angry with the airline staff, who more or less ignored them until they gave up, with some even leaving. After another half hour the boarding time was pushed back 1.5 hours, and somebody had heard from somewhere that we were missing our pilots (again without any announcement).
At this point, the staff finally acknowledged that this was not okay and provided free water and signed proofs of delay. People trying to get refunds for missed connecting flights or hotels were ignored once again.
Finally, after 9 hours of total delay and with us being completely drained and just wanting to go home, the pilots arrived, acting all happy as if nothing had happened - and after another half hour of waiting and 20 more minutes of waiting in the plane, we finally started. After 29 hours of total travel, we finally arrived in Vienna the next day.

The whole experience was not only extremely unprofessional for an international airline, but also just sad to even cruel and humiliating on a personal level, with little children having to wait the same 10 hours as we did and not receiving any additional care. This was literally the worst experience we could ever have imagined to have with an airline, to a level were we did not even believe what was happening anymore.

Regarding basic amenities, the in-flight entertainment did not work in every thinkable way possible - audio blasting at the highest volume regardless of settings, touchscreens not working, buttons on the remote not working - leading to it being unusable 2 out of 2 times we had it. Also, our second flight was 6 hours and did not have any inflight entertainment.

Overall, we recommend anyone to spend the extra money and use other airlines. The fact that what happened to us seems to be the norm for this airline is seriously frightening, and we would really like to know how a company like this can be a member of the Star Alliance."

Another flight booked on 22nd morning 5 am from Mumbai. Flight was from Bombay to Baroda booked to support my International flight coming from Munich.

It's a shame Air India despite being managed by Tata group still is allowed in such a fashion. I guess some things never change.

Air India being a pride of India should be intervened by the government with heavy cancellation compensation to the travellers. The image Air India conveys to the world is bad and I think not true.

Look at Indian Railways. It is an absolute winner. People blindly trust the IRCTC and what an amazing management. No wonder we should support Modi for bullet trains.

However, that is not the case at all. This plane has been the most dirty and uncomfortable flying experience I’ve had in my life. Whenever I have travelled with Air Canada, Emirates, or Etihad, I never had this issue. Below I have attached some images of a dirty stained table, which when I asked to get cleaned I got pieces of tissue to cover with. An awfully reclined seat which leaves no space for me or my family to eat. As I was eating, the man in front of me pushed his seat back so far that I dropped orange juice all over myself. Our seats are jammed so they don’t even push back and when asked for help they say there’s nothing they can do about it. The food was terrible, I had a few bites and then I was done with it. Was starving the whole flight. In addition to all that, on a fourteen hour direct flight, THEIR TV SCREENS DO NOT WORK! The whole plane ride I had just been staring at the home screen ( as shown in the picture attached below ). When I got up asked an attendant about the screen, she firmly said “ Only select TVs are going to work and we are not going to reboot them at this point “. She did not sound apologetic or welcoming. Neither did they announce it that the screens were not working, I had to get up and ask them. Terrible service and cleanliness overall.

Flight Air India 184 on July 4th 2023, is officially the worst aircraft I have been in. In the row 37, right side, all the TVs do not work. The TV remote of the non working TV has both of their volume keys missing, and when taken out, straight wire can be seen. The food tray is loose and doesn’t hold its weight. The tray is also slightly tilted so spills are inevitable. The Air Sickness Bag seems like it has already been used. The arm rest is very hard to lift up. A part of the seat, a passenger in front of me was sitting in, was ripped off and now dangling on the last piece of plastic. There is no way that the light above me can be turned off. The announcements made over the speaker are very muffled so it is very hard to hear.
And don’t even get me started on the food. Our first course was a lousy 5 minutes after takeoff and we were served a drink of our choice and Crunchy Corn. Good so far. Then for dinner, we were given option between non veg and veg. In my non veg plate, there was a carefully wrapped tin that said it had chicken. Though even I took a bit of that ‘chicken’ I knew instantly I didn’t want to eat it- I did eat some of the rice. There was also a water cup. They didn’t supply water bottles but the tiniest thing of water along with the most vomiting meal ever. For breakfast I got the omelet and oh boy I didn’t even have to taste it. The egg looked like rubber and the sausage on the side looked like a log of poop wrapped in plastic wrap."

I write to you with a sense of utmost disappointment, frustration, and deep distress regarding the handling of my recent travel experience with Air India. The events that unfolded during my journey from Vancouver, Canada to Delhi, India on Saturday, July 2nd 2023, originally scheduled at 10:15 AM. My name is Nishtha Manaksia, PNR no. 564JS3. ETKT NO. - 098970316821101. These were not only inconveniencing but also resulted in a grave violation of customer care and support.

Upon arriving at the airport, my fellow passengers and I were left utterly bewildered and helpless as we were informed, at the boarding gate, of the cancellation of our flight. To compound the matter, the absence of any Air India representative left us stranded without any guidance or assistance. It is beyond comprehension how such a lack of concern for the well-being of passengers could be exhibited by an airline of your stature.

In an attempt to seek assistance and clarity, I reached out to your customer support multiple times. Regrettably, each interaction only added to my distress as the representatives were of no help whatsoever. Despite explaining the urgency of my situation, which involved a pressing emergency, their apathy and indifference were astounding. I vividly recall being reduced to tears during one of those calls, pouring my heart out as I sought some compassion and understanding. However, my pleas fell on deaf ears.

As an international student, my financial resources are limited, and I found myself in a precarious situation due to Air India's callousness. The unforeseen circumstances forced me to extend my stay at an airport hotel, draining my funds significantly. The fact that Air India was negligent in making alternative arrangements, leaving me stranded for an unconscionable period of five days, is utterly unforgivable.

Furthermore, I was left with no choice but to secure an alternate flight through KLM on the 5th of July, incurring additional expenses that were not part of my original travel plans. It is distressing to note that I had to bear this financial burden due to Air India's failure to fulfill its responsibilities towards its passengers.

The emotional and financial distress caused by Air India's complete lack of empathy and professionalism is not only unacceptable but also borders on harassment. The disregard for my well-being and the negligence displayed throughout this ordeal is indicative of a severe systemic failure within your organization.

In light of the abovementioned circumstances, I demand immediate and comprehensive compensation from Air India, encompassing the following:

1. Full reimbursement of the air ticket fare for the canceled flight, AI 186.
2. Compensation for the additional expenses incurred during the extended hotel stay, including meals and transportation.
3. Reimbursement for the price difference between the original Air India flight and the KLM flight that I was forced to book as an alternative.
4. Adequate compensation for the emotional distress, inconvenience, and financial hardship endured as a result of Air India's negligence and lack of assistance.
5. Assurance that stringent measures will be implemented to prevent such incidents from recurring and that customer support will be trained to exhibit empathy and provide genuine assistance during critical situations.
Please be aware that this grave mishandling of my situation will not be tolerated. I expect immediate action and a prompt response to this complaint within 10 business days from the date of this correspondence. Failure to address this matter in a satisfactory manner will leave me with no choice but to escalate this complaint to higher authorities, including relevant consumer protection organizations and regulatory bodies.

I implore you to recognize the severity of the situation and to rectify the injustices I have endured. A swift resolution and adequate compensation are the minimum expectations in this matter.

Kindly acknowledge receipt of this email at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely,

2. Unable In connect headphone to the in-flight screen, the socket was too loose!!
3. My near-by passenger's screen was not working at all!!

After discussing with the air hostess, she said I can move to any empty seat and I moved towards my previously booked seat. After 5+ hours into the flight, another air hostess woke me at around 3AM asked to go back my original assigned seat. The occupant of my new seat was sleeping on a mid-row 3 seater, but air hostess woke her also to give that 3 seater mid-row space to another passenger so he can sleep!! Question is why is AI favoring one passenger to another after 5+ into the flight?!! Someone they know or relative of a higher-up?!!

I went back to my originally assigned seat with broken entertainment console, after complaining the same to that air hostess she placed to a different seat, which was ok.

When my daughter traveled by AI in the fall of 2022, she too said the seat and screen was broken. This clearly shows the lack of maintenance to the aircraft and AI seems to have no respect to a passenger safety or experiences traveling non-stop 16 hour flights. If flights to long-distance US are like this, one can imagine the rest!!. Probably they should travel by other airlines to get a feel of that. I travel all around the world with various airlines, Aero Mexico, Korean, Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Copa, Sky airlines etc etc so many. This is one of the worst in passenger experiences!!

During the boarding and seating phase, the hand carried luggage was loaded on the upper bin. The bin was open and empty for more passenger bags. Passenger on-boarding process was going on, one of the Punjabi air hostess was shouting ""close the bin, close the bin"". Almost in all the airlines, if the crew noticed a bin is open they'll come an close it before asking the passenger to close it, since it takes minimal efforts to do that. Here in AI this lady was shouting multiple times whenever she passes that aisle, where she herself could close it!! What a customer service? She still thinks that, she works for a public sector, where she gets paid for rude customer interactions and behaviors!!

Again no in-between snacks were kept in the kitchen or served to passengers. The snacks variety was also limited and not much choice. So people wont venture for the same snack :(

Another irritation is doing immigration in Delhi, than in the final destination as with all other airlines. Doing immigration is not the problem, but one has to take the bags in Delhi and re-check-in again to the final destination. What a looser, can't they avoid this make it convenient to the passenger and make the bags delivered all the way to the destination?!!

Most airlines have amenities in the toilet, like tooth brush, comb etc etc in the toilet. A 16 hour AI flight had nothing in it. Plus unlike other airlines AI crew does not clean the toilets after few hours since the usage will be more in these long haul flights!! The airfare was bit lower than other airlines in that sector, but didn't expect this much. Shame of AI in terms of passenger experiences, people may think twice before booking via AI!!

Apart from the entertainment, seating and one crew behaviors, the food was reasonably ok and tasty, on-time departures and arrivals, baggage handling etc. Heard AI is getting new air crafts mid last year, still cant they at least maintain the current ones to make it function-able?"
"2023-07-17T15:34:47-04:00","1","review","0","AVOID AVOID AVOID","Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. 

Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. 
Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. 

So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats).However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever!

However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. He also said that he got very sick from eating Air India food before, so the guy literally didn’t eat anything the whole 14-hour flight. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? 

What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in the trash bin.” Really? So, Air India is quite literally punishing passengers who follow the proper etiquette of flying. Same flight attendant, later in the flight. Cut like 5 people waiting in line for the bathroom to go use it herself. No apologies and no thank yous, again. By the 7th hour the hand soap had run out, so when I went back to inform the flight attendant, the same rude flight attendant, after ignoring me and asking me to wait like 5 times, finally told me that they had no “reserves” of hand soap. Really Air India (Tata?)? Indian Rail provides better service than you, apparently. 

So let me understand this, the flight have gotten worse (literally in the last 6 Air India flights that I took the inflight entertainment system did not work), the food has gotten worse, and is giving people food poisoning. On top of that, the Air India staff have somehow become ruder, and more pathetic, after a takeover by TATA. So, hey Air India, why do you think you get to charge premium prices? The only reason anyone ever flew your pathetic, Airline, and dealt with your uncivilized rude staff is because you were dirt cheap. But somehow you think now you can charge Emirates prices, based on the TATA brand, but provide service standards that are lower than the local police station in India. Sorry, I won’t be traveling with Air India anymore. Patriotism has its limits, and while I can put up with anything I cannot put up with bad service from uncivilized, and untrained flight attendants."

This was a London to Kochi direct flight and that is where the good news ends

1. Water dripping from the roof in 2 out of four seats we booked
2. Ran out of non veg food after they served row 1
3. Tray table tilted so I had to balance with my left leg raised (to eat veg food of course)
4. Toilet area disgusting and held together by MASKING TAPE!!!
5. Entertainment didn't work but I was warned of this. When I found one that worked, the earphones wouldn't fit. All four of our entertainment systems failed. Luckily we had backups on ipad as I was warned about this by a recent traveller colleague
6. Air India systems will not allow online check in if you are under 12. So we had to queue up for our 6 year old
7. Electrical sockets didnt work for our entire row

And all this for only £3200 for the family for economy.

Highly recommended if you want to really piss someone off. Waste of an airline and shameful that it is the flag bearer with the country name on it.

We couldn't even turn on the reading light or call crew for assistance as these functions were connected to the remote of non-functional entertainment system.

We were a family of three and two of our seats were broken and was very uncomfortable to sit down! Meal quantity was too small and no provisions for intermittent snacks. 

Glitches in Air India system kept refusing my United Airlines FF status (UA Premier 1K). Finally, it took my FF number, however even after issuing the boarding pass (which shows my UA FF #), Air India system deleted my FF status. So, I was stopped at the boarding gate and was asked to pay for the extra baggage which came with my FF status. It was disappointing! Finally, the gate agent managed to enter my UA FF number again and let go me!

He said you have 5 kg overweight. Then in front me he called other person to tell that she has 5 kg overweight how much we are gonna charge her. He told me to pay $285 for 5 kg which was not even extra luggage. Every passenger board their flight and they don’t let me board until I paid the amount they said. This is ridiculous.

We travelled earlier last month and the entertainment system was not working at all and my young kids got very restless. This was the case for the whole flight. The food was however fairly decent. The toilets were not in good condition and the seats next to it was not great. We were not provided with any blankets in the flight from Heathrow to Mumbai and only a few were scattered on the backseat, however in todays flight everyone was provided with a blanket, so hence the last flight was not good value for money. 
We travelled again today and we were in transit at Mumbai in the way to Chennai. From London (Heathrow) to Mumbai, one of our baggage’s didn’t make it (bear in mind this was only one stretch). We had to file a report in Mumbai and the staff there were extremely slow. They took nearly two hours to just file a report on one missing baggage ( and keep in mind there was no queue for this appeal, it was just us). As a result, we nearly missed our connecting flight to Chennai and it caused our family lots of stress, especially with kids. When we told the staff there we were rushing, they were still working at a slow pace and seemed quite absent minded. I understand it was early in the morning, however surely atleast a little more can be expected. 
The entertainment system did not work this time either, and although the staff attempted to reset it, it was of no use, and this was the second time that was happening. The food was however good. 
There were some very good staff on the plane who genuinely had the airlines best interest at heart and did all they could to help enhance our experience and they recognised it was already in quite a hopeless situation and gave their level best, however there were many that really made our experience very bad, not once, but twice. 
Air India has the potential to improve its reputation for sure and the staff that genuinely did have the best interest at heart will hopefully bring this up one day, but at the moment, Air India has a lot of work to do to reach the standard that people would hope to expect.

Was checked again before entering airplane by Air India staff and again all ok( they checked my bag also).
Going through transfer at Gandhi airpor and now security says I can't take vape, charger etc. So now how do you deal with this. You can't have it in luggage and now not in carry on.

"2023-06-27T22:18:51-04:00","5","review","0","Delightfully surprised!","I had the opportunity to travel on AI flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to India. I haven't been adventurous enough to try them out international as I've heard my share of horror stories. I'm going to base my review on the 2 Pune-Delhi flights I've taken in this period.

Booking: Honestly, approached the flight with some degree of trepidation based on the bad rap AI have had over the years. During the booking process, AI fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines. AI is full service. Which means 25 kgs of check-in luggage and meals served on-board. A huge win right away. Online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites. Rating: 10/10

Check In: The check-in counter for AI literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones. That did make me somewhat nervous the first time. As it turns out eventually, the flights both times were completely full so I have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at check-in. Maybe fewer flights? Nevertheless, the check-in agent was quick, efficient, polite, addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate. I was out and about in no time - both times. No complaints. Rating: 10/10

Boarding: Boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled. On both the flights I took. However the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time. Rating: 8/10

Stewards: On both occasions, the cabin stewards / stewardesses were polite, efficient and thoroughly professional. Albeit the first flight, they weren't overly keen to smile. On the second flight, they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please. A very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience. 10/10

The craft: This was an older A320. Not the Neo version. Strangely, there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and I had (non working) screen controls. None of the others did. I guess, they reused some seats from other aircraft. The seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers. At 5ft7, I had decent enough knee room. But the seat width - that was definitely a bonus. Wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights, but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer A350s and B787s. That made a huge impact and I did not have to fight it out with my co-passenger for rights over the arm rest. Of course, the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics. But it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting. Rating: 7/10

Meals: Dinner was served. Chicken korma with rice and some veggies. Some yoghurt and a brownie cake. Was decent fare. Served with steel cutlery. Thank you AI! International carriers make note, it's criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery. Why do you do it? The cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and I did a stress test, it was actually quite rigid and strong. Well done. Service was quick and as efficient as how I was getting used to by now. 8/10

Punctuality: Both times on AI, the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached New Delhi 30-35 mins ahead of schedule! I repeat - 30-35 mins ahead of schedule. On a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs!! This is serious WOW. Super impressed. 10/10!!!!

Extras: So throughout the trip, I kept getting emails and SMSes from AI with status updates on departure gates and other bits and bobs of info. I even got an alert to state that my bags have been loaded onto the aircraft! Which top airline does that? Cathay? Singapore? Etihad? Nada. Well done AI. 10/10

Overall - a resounding 10/10
I have been overwhelmingly pleased with both my trips on AI domestic. I hope this is experience is not specific only to the Pune-Delhi sector. But as of now, it's an all thumbs up from me. I don't hand out 10/10 scores that easy.

I had booked two tickets from Birmingham to Kochi via Delhi and return. On the way back, the flight from Kochi  to Delhi, AI466 (14 June) was delayed for nearly 6 hours due to some technical problem.  We were informed by the Air India staff that our connection flight to Birmingham from Delhi will be held in Delhi as there is more than 20 passengers heading in that direction. 
However, when we reach Delhi the flight to Birmingham had already left, and after a long wait we were moved to a hotel. The attitude of the ground staff at Delhi is terrible, as we had to explain everything to one officer over there who refused to accept responsibility and made everyone wait for a couple of hours. The only apparent solution that was offered was a flight the next day to London and we were promised transport to Birmingham as according to him there are no seats left to Birmingham. But while waiting for him to finish this task, we found out that his shift finished and he left without him explaining anything to the people taking over. So now we found ourselves having to again explain with the new person who came in, and at last were moved to hotel. The lack of responsibility and order within the staff was apparent and appalling. We were given coaches to and from the Delhi airport and right in front of our eyes, our suitcases were being thrown and abused. We reached back to the airport next day and we flied in Vistara airways (UK17, 15 June) to Heathrow London, and landed in London an hour late than what was scheduled. When we came out we found that there is no one from Air India to arrange or provide information for our ongoing transport to Birmingham. Thus, we called the custmer service and the person who answered the phone said he cant do anything and that we need to go to Air India counter at the Heathrow airport. Keep in mind that no information regarding the location, a local contact number or even an email could be provided by the customer support and in one instance they hung up on us mid conversation saying they cannot help. As our flight landed in terminal 3 and Air India had their counter only on terminal 2 according to the Heathrow staff, all of us ,almost 20 passengers, pushed all our luggage and walked to terminal 2. After a good 15 minutes walk only to find out the terminal was closed and no one was there, we again called the customer service and they said they cant do anything. Keep in mind that the transport from Heathrow to Birmingham has been promised ever since Delhi. As the responsibility fell under Air India, the staff there could not do anything and everyone in the flight that were in the same situation had lives and responsibilities to get to. We were left stranded with all our luggage, 3 hours away from our destination and we had no choice but to call our own taxi at 1 Am night to Birmingham which cost me £300. And as there is around 20 people every one had to call individual taxis as the Uber or other viable options cant fit more than 2 or 3 suitcases. We only reached Birmingham around 4 am.
Among the passengers, there were some older couples, parents and people who were new to the country and I felt sorry for them and for myself as this was an enormous setback and overall rude and disrespectful to my son and I by the Air India staff and company.

So please avoid Air India if you are travelling with elderly persons, to a new country or just travelling with them in general, as they can delay your flight, give you false promises, show you bogus emails impersonating a responsible person and push you out to the next location and leave you stranded."

"2023-06-14T19:12:54-04:00","1","review","2","Worst operating airline and no humanity in the staff","On Jun 10, my wife was on Air India flight AI-462 from Amritsar to Delhi. The flight went under some turbulence after which the pilot lost control of the flight and dropped the flight by 20 feet in a free fall. It was quite horrifying for all my fellow passengers. Unfortunately, my wife was waiting for the restroom with my little one and she almost flew in the air, hit her head with the roof, and landed on her right leg where she suffered 3 fractures. My little one had some bruises as well. All this happened in 15 seconds of so-called turbulence which #airindia folks called “normal”. Apart from her injury, I am sure fellow passengers went through a lot of trauma.
We were assisted by a fellow passenger who happened to be in the medical profession as the cabin crew had no understanding or experience in handling such a situation.
Once the flight landed, an ambulance was called in to take her to Medanta Hospital.
Now the sad part is how #airindia officials started to shy away from their responsibility. Not even a single person accompanied us to the hospital. Cabin crew Mandeep and Ground Staff @Mukut Kumar at Delhi airport were there but no one took the responsibility or considered on how the family of 4 (2 US citizens and 2 NRIs) will manage by themselves.
Another disappointing part was pilot and co-pilot came in with no remorse or apology for what happened. After talking to some people I found that such incidents are quite usual with #airindia flights. I have traveled across the world and over a million miles and have never gone through such an experience that they claim to be normal. I have two basic questions:
1) Why are people so tolerant of such incidents? Shouldn’t there be an investigation on how #airindia pilots are trained to fly during such weather conditions?
2) Shouldn’t #airindia take any responsibility if a passenger gets level 3 injuries? The victim had multiple fractures and had to undergo surgery. There is mental, physical, and financial trauma involved and #AirIndia was completely silent.

I hope #airindia learns to put their act together and realize that flying lives is not a joke and take ownership of their corporate social responsibilities. #ratantatasir I hope this airline stands up to your name and fly safely and shows some humanity in the future. For me, #airindia is blacklisted going forward till the time they do some major reforms. #trauma #experience #airline #india"

But here I am. Some people travel Air India to show their patriotism, I traveled for expedient purposes. Nevertheless, the experience I had on the evening and night of June 11 convinced me that I will never touch this sorry excuse for an airline again.

A cyclone delayed several flights on the evening/night of June 11. Our flight that was supposed to depart at 6:10pm was first delayed to 7:10pm and then to 8:10pm. But 8:10pm came and went and with passengers milling around the check-in counter, Air India's staffers had no updates on when/if we would fly out that evening. The reasons for delay ranged from not having an aircraft to not having a crew to the vague ""we don't know"". The words ""we don't know"" should not be part of an airline employee's vocabulary when it comes to providing updates on a flight delay.

As the night progressed (and no updates were provided) the scene at the gate deteriorated to a series of shouting matches between travelers and employees. Traveling with children, we felt very unsafe and if not for bags we had checked in we would have canceled on this flight ourselves and taken another one. The night wore on with no updates forthcoming. No supervisors were available to answer our questions and all we had to do was ask the same questions over and over again to the low-level employees who would give us a deer-in-the-headlights look. Meanwhile, all around us Indigo flights (another Indian carrier) were taking off, further causing immense frustration.

Finally, at 4am on the next morning (after having spent the night at the airport), we lined up to board (Air India mustered a flight and a crew). But the saga was not over. Two unruly passengers from another flight (flight 576) actually blocked us from boarding stating it was their right to get on this flight as well. Air India's employees did nothing (did not call police for example to arrest them) and a fight ensued between passengers of AI573 (our flight) and AI576. Finally, a Star Alliance member took charge from the spineless Air India employees and helped us board (but not without going through that unique Indian experience where people will not line up for anything).

This experience has left me shaken and I have taken the decision not just to never fly Air India again but to get on my soapbox and shout out loud to anyone who would listen to do the same. Air India does not deserve your business."

2)I flew with Air India on the Kathmandu-Delhi-Tel Aviv route. I was just shocked by this airline, I have traveled dozens of countries and used at least 100 airlines around the world, and I have not seen this ANYWHERE.

1) On the way Delhi-Tel Aviv turned on the entertainment system (video), it did not work, and not only for me, but for half of the plane. I contacted the crew member several times, at first I received only promises in the spirit of “we will now restart the system”, “we are working on it”, then she finally admitted that the system simply did not work and offered some logs. So do not believe what is written on the ticket, ""video of your choice"", this is FAKE. Not to provide services for which the client has paid, and not to give compensation, this is the same as STEALING MONEY, fraud. I have video proof that the system didn't work.
It's not just about the video. They have a button to call the stewardesses built into the remote, which did not work. So if you feel bad - shout (if you can), there is no option to call someone with a button; if you need it - go to the other end of the plane and ask for it yourself.
So it's just dangerous for you."

"2023-06-08T06:57:14-04:00","1","review","3","NEVER AGAIN!","Hi Air India, 

Why do you insist on being the worst airline on the planet? Even worse than Domestics like Spirit airlines? I had a sudden, surge in patriotism, after a bad experience with Lufthansa in 2017. So I started flying Air India. Living on the West Coast I used to take the SFO-DEL flight. I was pleasantly surprised how well the service was in-flight and by ground staff. So, I thought well, “acche din” is coming. 

Oh, how wrong I was. Since then, I have flown your airline, now from EWR-DEL about 5 times, and every time the experience got progressively worse. If I had to summarize, I would say that in 2017 your staff started behaving like proper human beings, because they were afraid, they would be cut when privatization happens. But when they were not cut, clearly, they have gone back to their old pattern of treating the customer like dirt. Even a “bus conductor” is more polite than your staff members. 

The absolute worst was the flight on May 23, 2023, that I took from EWR-DEL. To begin, unlike the staff of every other airline, Air India staff at EWR do not seem to greet customers either at the beginning or at the end of the transaction, unless they are white (more on this later!). So, I check in with the help of a grumpy middle-aged woman, and then go through security. I see that the flight is on time, which surprises me, and I hope for good things (oh how wrong I was). As soon as I got on the flight it smelled like a urinal. Somehow all the storage space on top of the seats were taken, so the flight attendant put my weekender bag about 20 isles behind me, and my backpack a bout 5 isles before me. You know, even domestic airlines in the U.S., have figured out how to fit their luggage. Seated on my seat, oh well, I was almost reminded of a rackety old chair I picked up from Goodwill when I was in college. The in-flight entertainment center of course did not work, which was hilariously predictable. The flight was alternatively too hot and too cold. Food were terrible. Whatever, I just closed by eyes and was half-asleep when we landed in Delhi. 

Now, mind you, I am newly minted “patriotic Indian,” so I was going to forgive all these, and never badmouth the titular airline of my country on the internet. But what happened next was truly surreal. I was, by design, with a white friend of mine who was travelling with me to see India for 2-weeks. I told him to watch the difference between how your airport staff treat him and me. And as I type this, this makes me sad for the future of my country, my friend got a much superior level of service than I did. Mind you, not at the immigration desk, or by the police or security, who were all nice (they get a bad rap for no reason in India). But by the so called “trained” customer service agents of Air India. Firstly, there is no one maintaining line at the transfer desk, so it’s open season on polite passengers. My friend transfers his bags before me and I see the Air India girl who is working at the desk be very ncie to him, which gives me hope. But by the time I go there, she has reverted to not even acknowledging my presence, until I ask her, “is there anything wrong here?” “No,” she replies and keeps texting on her phone. So I put my bag on the conveyer belt, and this girl starts shouting at me, until I shout back (my friends, you don’t have to tolerate the BS they put you through). So then she lowers her voice and says the belt is stuck. So, I want and check in, finally. I am still perplexed by the total colonial BS that this woman has in her head. Still perplexed, but not surprised, at the open racism that a supposedly educated Air India staff is showing. 

	But it doesn’t end there. Same, behavior then is shown by the guy who is checking out boarding pass when we board our connecting to Kolkata. To my friend he says, “thank you, have a nice flight.” To me he doesn’t even make eye contact, and hands over the boarding pass like it’s a piece of dirt. Again, same for the flight attendant. But at this point I am too tired to count the offenses, and my patriotism for Air India has vanished in thin air. 

	See I can tolerate almost anything. I mean we all know that Air India is the absolute worst airline that exists on the international stage. But what I won’t tolerate is blatant racism, by the colonized staff of Air India. Behave yourselves Air India, serve people, and stop acting like a GDDM government entity. 

	When I landed in Kolkata, my patriotism for Air India now gone, I realized that I would have another horrible return flight in a month, but after this experience, I am NEVER booking Air India. 

	You know us Indians are always decrying racism, and biased treatment in foreign countries, but you know, those countries have rules against it. The flight attendants go through training and retraining after even one customer complains (see United). But sadly, there are no repercussions to the blatant racism, and discrimination shown by, especially, your staff in Delhi. 

	Sorry you were always the weakest link, amongst the giants of the skies, but I gave you a try simply because of your name (not your reputation). And now, well bye bye and so long, thankfully the staff at other airlines are not empowered to insult their customers. 

Adios, 

Sandip Roy"

Due to terrible experience then I stopped. I gave it a try again this year. To tell you the truth it was even worse. First they emailed me night before telling me flight was delayed for 3 hours. Once I boarded the plane, there were no headphones  and the answer I got from flight attendant was sorry we have no more just easy as that. Imagine 14 hours without any entertainment, i will let you figure that out. Now we are 1.5 hours late still hasn’t taken off. I heard an announcement after one hour saying they are fueling. They had 5 hours to refuel so what they were doing. I doubt that’s the real reason. Let me stop here. I am sure I will have more unpleasant surprises waiting for me. Not to mention, I will miss my connecting flight. I thought once TATA was taken over the management, there was some hope but there isn’t. If you need to manage something simple making sure we have enough headphones in the plane, even a child can do it. I am extremely disappointed."

I selected a vegan meal online prior to the flight to ensure that I had meals to last the 10 hour flight, unfortunately I didn't receive these meals and was told by your staff on board that I could only eat certain parts of the first meal (despite not knowing which parts) and your staff incorrectly informed me that I could eat the second meal, but this contained milk. I shouldn't have to explain, but I selected this meal as I'm both lactose intolerant and vegan, I don't want to think about what would happen if someone had a more severe allergy and ate this meal. 

The second issue after not having meals that I could eat on the long flight was the fact that the entertainment system was down for the whole plane, so I was unable to watch anything for the entire 10 hour flight. There was very little explanation as to what was happening and I had to ask multiple times as to what was going on after hours had passed.

The third issue was the USB charging port for my seat and apparently other seats around me did not work, so I was unable to charge my phone on the flight.

I find the lack of food that I requested, paired with the lack of understanding about the issue, lack of screen and entertainment and lack of charging to be unacceptable."

Flight: AI174
Destination : SFO to DEL 13th May 2023, departing at 10:30 am
- During this extensive journey, we were disappointed with the limited meal options. We were only served a small pack of lunch and a small portion of cold pasta with mushrooms. Despite informing Ms. Nisha about our mushroom allergy, she responded very rudely that we could remove the mushrooms ourselves. Regrettably, the airline did not offer any additional meal services and denied even basic requests for water, cold drinks or alcoholic beverages.
- I unfortunately faced an unprofessional situation with cabin crew member Ms. Nisha. Her behavior towards my wife and me lacked proper communication and courtesy, leaving me concerned about the presence of such crew members on a 16-hour long-haul flight.
- Additionally, the inoperative entertainment system deprived passengers of any form of entertainment for the duration of the flight. Adding to the disappointment, the broken seats, including our own, were unable to recline properly, hindering our comfort and ability to rest. Even the food tray couldn’t be opened adequately to accommodate a meal.

I kindly request Air India’s acknowledgement of the inconveniences and shortcomings faced during my SFO to DEL flight. Appropriate compensation is sought for the subpar service, which included multiple issues such as rude behavior of a cabin crew member, limited meal options, malfunctioning entertainment system, broken seats and lack of basic amenities. These factors significantly impacted the quality of my journey.

Background:

I initially booked Boston to Dubai and Dubai to Hyderabad using #united. United Airlines and Air India are part of the star alliance and partner airlines. I booked these two tickets separately after confirming with both airlines that I will not have any issues with baggage and, they would transfer over from one airline to another and no extra fees. United flight had some technical issues and, they transferred us to Emirates. Asked to collect our bags in HYD. 

I am traveling with my daughter and we landed in Dubai as expected from Boston and found our way to the Air India counter in Dubai airport for our boarding passes. The misery starts from here. The Connections Air India crew at Dubai airport asked us to pay $500 for baggage excess fees or else they will not take my bags or give me my boarding pass. My ticket was only $130. I explained that I am traveling internationally and I confirmed before buying tickets I paid for these tickets using the Air India reservations line and listen to the recordings of my conversation. It was a huge fight with them, they said my Air India flight was not on the same reservation as United and they said they will provide baggage services to only US and Canadian citizens (We both are US citizens) but traveling back to the US and not India. The crew was not at all helpful and didn’t give us a boarding pass and didn’t let us in as I didn’t want to pay the $500 bag fees. After a huge dispute, they refused to give us our boarding passes or any form of written evidence that we were present at the gate or to log a complaint. Moreover, they refused to cancel the ticket and issue a refund, leaving us stranded at the airport and in an incredibly vulnerable position.

I and My daughter were left in the Dubai airport by AIR-INDIA stranded. Right infant of us Airindia crew asked the baggage transfers team to hold our bags over the phone, even though the United and Emirates both gave us baggage transfer tickets to collect our lounge in HYD. We were shocked and my daughter was crying, no sleep and we were in bad shape mentally and emotionally. We called several times AIRIndia customer service and they didn’t help us either. We were scared and we didn’t know where our baggage was (Terminal 3 where the United and Emirates operates or Terminal 1 where AirIndia operates) and how to reach our final destination. Airindia customer service people barely speak English, we had to repeat ourselves many times to explain one line. The crew at transfers/connections and over the phone, has no compassion, empathy, or sympathy for our situation, no feelings at all, very very RUDE.

Dubai airport:

After this experience, I had low expectations of getting help. Dubai Airport suggested that many people go through this situation with Airindia and asked us to buy another ticket with another airline and asked us to go back to Terminal 3 and work with Emirates for baggage claim. Helped us with the bus that takes us back to Terminal 3 

Emirates crew:

Emirates handled our situation with compassion. It was a bit tricky situation, we had to visit many Emirates locations in the airport finally they located our bags and without any hassles or any more trouble to us or any extra fees, they sent our bags to Terminal 1 arrivals and asked us to collect it there and re-check them with our new airlines. Helped us with directions and getting out of the airport and coming back as if we are boarding from Dubai.

Indigo:

Finally, amazing service they listen to our situation and were willing to help and they understood how we ended up buying an Indigo ticket. Please know that Airindia and Indigo have similar baggage policies, however, they weighed each bag and where we had some extra lbs, asked us to transfer it over to carry-on and allowed us to carry 2 carryons to accommodate and help the situation. They helped us with some adjustments and finally, we landed in HYD.

-Unhappy and frustrated passengers of #airindia, please do not travel with them, if you have the choice to take any other airline to your final destination, you are better off with the other option."

Reason to select Air India was 2 fold - one the timing was well suitable, then we have been tired seeing only Indigo as the option in our prior trips oflate and waiting to try other reliable ones.
Flight was on time and reached 20 min before schedule, the flight time was 70 min which was higher for the route but the norm is so.  Meal options were subject to flight time and while this was about 40 min flight, Air India provided a decent pack (a mini water bottle, cookies and a kathi roll) and neatly packed while for less than 60 min no hot meals are provided in general.  
All crew were very professional and helping.  It was an Airbus A320 and quite comfortable.  It was also fitted with inflight entertainment system but disabled.

Overall thank you Air India for such pleasant take off to a happy vacation with family."

Recently, on a hunch, worried that I may regret going to a sub par facility, AI lounge at international departure gates, JFK, I did go in and sure enough, a terrible facility. Tata took over at least a year before. 0 rating on everything ....food, crockery, cutlery, furniture and people. This is JFK mind you. Imagine any other smaller airport.

Subsequently when others who wanted to see me off called AI office for revised schedule, AI refused to give, even claiming shockingly that they had no information about the flight AI 175. When I called, I was grilled about booking confirmation, date of travel, email address, frequent flyer number whereas just with booking confirmation all the other information would have been available.and then was on long hold repeatedly before I got the revised schedule. Why was departure time, which should have been available in the public domain, treated like a State Secret? The Associate then tried to make me postpone my flight. Shockingly inexplicable behaviour.

Firstly, there was no callout for Air India passengers while we were getting the security check at the departure counter where we were standing for almost 20 mins. When we reached the bag drop area, we were late by 10 mins only of the boarding time. However, the staff refused to allow us to board the flight. We requested a lot to allow us to board the plane since we still had 45 mins left for the plane to depart. But she plainly refused and told us to visit the reception to reschedule our tickets. The reception counter is a little away from the baggage drop area. We went there hoping to get some relief or discount on our rescheduled ticket. However, the staff at the reception told us that they can't do anything and that we will have to book fresh tickets. This was a total waste of time shuffling from one counter to the other just to hear that they can't do anything. Since we had no other option we had to book our tickets but we decided to book Indigo. We definitely had a good in-flight experience with Indigo.

Air India is a pathetic airlines with very bad customer service. Please do not waste your money because if we are late they do not adjust, but when their flight is late we have to adjust."

There was food on the carpet near my seat, and everything from the table trays to the screens was dirty. This was one of the worst experiences of my life, and I will never fly with Air India again. The entertainment on the 15-hour flight didn't work, and I couldn't even call the flight attendants because the remotes were not working either. It was so bad that it could start another pandemic. Even public restrooms feel cleaner compared to Air India.

Additionally, the airport service provided by Air India was terrible. Our gate was changed last minute without any announcements, and we had to walk five miles to get to it. The staff was unorganized, inefficient, and slow. Overall, I wouldn't even rank this flight a negative because it would be an insult to the negative numbers. I would much rather walk 50 miles than take another flight with Air India or even be near an Air India flight with a 10 ft pole.

 - After getting on the plane when asked for paid baby bassinet they said they don't have any? Now that was too much.
 - All 3 entertainment screens in our row did not work, they restarted the screen 7 times with zero results. 

- they runout of meals that we requested, so no food to eat.   

Now The Customer service (Unrealistic)

 - Made bout 15 calls to ask for refund for paid seats and baby bassinet, they said they will give points as a discount for next flightI said you must be joking they hung up the call. 

-   I tried both customer services in Hindi & English, both were unprofessional and had no manners. 

- The phone always cuts off, when you call back someone new answers the call and you have to repeat everything - happened to me about 10 times.   

- When on the phone I could hear people selling vegetables and fruits in the background and you can hear them louder than the Air India representative, I simply felt like Air India opened customer service office in a sabzi mandi?   

- That was our first time flying with Air India and also the last..

Air India refused to follow baggage protocols on my itinerary; They also refused to follow their own baggage rules when I pointed to the info on their website. One bag was checked in with no issues, an additional oversize package @ 8 kgs was supposed to be $15/Kg, charged $370. This package was less than 158 centimeters in total length (less than allowed max), (This package was received at at my destination broken in pieces). I was also not allowed to carry-on my bag which was 4 kg overweight, straight refusal and forced to check-in as well @ $240 charge. I was also told that it was my choice if I really wanted to fly today as intended or I would need to buy a new ticket to return home in the US.

Check-in agents were shocked at charges laid out by their onsite supervisor. The first guy decided to go on break and the second person raised her voice at the supervisor appalled at his behavior. Initial quote was $130 but ended up paying $609.71 in baggage charges that are equal to INR 51,800. When I filed a complaint today, their customer service agent verified that the charge should have been $15/kg for the additional package as stated on their website and no other charges were necessary. 

Inflight experience was very poor in regard to entertainment screens and/or remotes not working - changed seats three times but ended up flying with blank or frozen screens. Inexperience was evident as far as the in-cabin staff were concerned with no help from them. I do have to mention that this was a very unclean/stinky Dreamliner aircraft.

What did not make sense to was that I was asked by the onsite supervisor if I was a US Citizen…!

I informed immediately the crew members, and they didn't even apologize or speak to him they just told ""You can look if there is any other available seat""!!!! when I find another seat on my own the tv screen didn't work and we are not talk about a 1 hour flight! it was a 8hours flight with no tv screen and middle seat even though I payed and chose a window seat!!! I complained once again and with a loud voice the lady from the cabin crew tells me ""Ma'am 70% of our tv screens don't work and if you want you can't ask people who are not using their tv screens to switch their seat with you, I am not going to bother them for that""

But after trying twice I thaught to wait till evening and need to decide what should I do, i called again in evening around 8 pm on 5th April but they were saying the same thing I made them understood the criticality that If I would wait then it can happen that I would be loosing my ticket without rescheduling it. So they have generated a new link where it was showing me 5040 INR however previously I had paid 4200 INR which was still pending and as per them it will be refunded back to me for sure however I was already loosing my 800 due to their application issue so when I have asked them about that and they where putting excuse of dynamic rating but I kept telling them that it's their application issue not mine so someone should be paying those amount should be air india not me. However after this time payment application was showing me that my ticket got rescheduled on 11th APR, but again on 10th I called them to check status and as per them it was still showing them as pending and this time they told me that use some other payment option instead of UPI. they tried to generate link with no luck and after 2 3 hours of struggle their link came however it was for evening flight not the one for which I was trying. And after payment i called them again and this time they were saying that payment they received but I need to wait till 3 4 hours and it was already 10pm that day so i called them in morning 7:30 am, but they still saying me same status and when I asked when it will get confirmed, so they said their backend manager will come and they will help you around 12 pm so after a long call i agreed to them but I made call at 11 and they have helped me to confirm the ticket but after 20 30 minutes of waiting they come with confirmation but as per them I paid only 4000 inr which is cost of one seat only i have to pay another 4000 to get both the ticket confirmed and to prove it they told me to check rescheduling fairs and all but then why they had provided me link for 4000 last night if they would have provided me exact amount i would have cancelled my ticket. After this much struggle with air india finally I reached my destination but now after 2 weeks my 4200 transaction refunded me back and nobody is replying on their complaint email for my 5040 INR refund and it seems it won't get refunded me back ever, let's hope for better relation in future if I would prefer to fly with them."

We were ready to take off, when, only 5 min before take off, the captain announced that the left engine and AC had developed trouble and would be mended soon.  Until 6 pm, captain Deshpande kept on telling the 380 passengers that the left engine defect would be mended soon and we will take off for Dubai, any minute. The AC system was part of the breakdown resulting in sweltering heat and a choking sensation due to lack of fresh air and 35C heat. Children, old folk and women started wailing and some people raided the cockpit to ask the captain to arrange buses that could ferry us back to airport lounges where they could breathe some fresh air and escape the heat.  The captain ignored all pleas and kept on saying that he will take the aircraft back to bay where it would be mended within minutes and then he will take off for Dubai. We spent nearly 5 hrs listening to this silly captain's announcements. Finally, light dawned on him and he ordered buses to take us back to airport lounges, until his superiors from AI would decide what to do. The buses came but we were not allowed to go inside the airport as the ""superior"" orders had not been issued yet. We all spent another hour huddled and sandwiched in the buses.This included the business class passengers who were part of the crowd. We were not allowed to speak to anyone in higher authority. People were dying inside the buses for want of relieving themselves in a bathroom. At about 10 pm, passengers literally broke the cordon in the building and we ran inside towards bathrooms and the AI lounge to help ourselves with food. All of us, including children, were hungry and thirsty. No food or drink was offered to us for 5 hrs in the plane. At 10.30 pm we were informed that a new plane had been arranged to take us to Dubai. We were told that this new plane would take off at 11.45 pm. We all rushed towards this new plane and boarded it through stairs.  Luckily, the AC was working in this plane, so we all sat back in our seats, expecting a quick take off. Lo and behold, the aircraft was moored to the ground without any sign of movement. No enquiry was properly replied, until, by some trickery, some sly passengers found out that the plane had no fuel in it, and was being refuelled. This took another 1.5 hours, during which time we were sat in the plane looking at each other. We finally took off at 2.30 in the morning and arrived in Dubai at about 6 in the morning (4.30 am local time). The food served was very basic and stale. No drinks. The aircraft was an old banger which they dug out from a forgotten hanger somewhere. It was making awful noises on take off, during flight and also in landing. We were scared to death and hoped that the ever merciful Allah will save us and bring us to our destination. 
There is a lot more to say about this episode, but my time and energy does not permit me to proceed any further.
I very much hope that this message receives a viral certificate."

1. The staff members would charge for extra luggage even if it was 0.1kg over the limit. We even spoke to the staff members, who were rude about it, and in the end, we had to pay for 5kg cause some of our luggage was 0.1 - 0.5 kg extra. 

2. They have also started to weigh your laptop bag, which no other airline does. We would always carry it with us, not even put it in the cabin.

3. They had technical/operational issues with their system, where people got the same seat assigned; thus, the flight was delayed.

4. When arriving at Varanasi airport after the domestic flight, one of their staff came to us to help with our luggage (which we never asked for), and another staff member gave us a slip to pay for it. It was annoying how we get asked to pay for something we never asked for.

This is just to re-iterate, for the money, we thought it was fine. You are not paying BA or Emirates prices so don’t expect premium.

Decor is a bit dated, my wife thought it was like having a seat in someone’s old living room. Legroom is decent and I am 6ft 5in.

Food does the job, again don't expect gourmet.

Flight entertainment was a little limited but found enough to watch. There were a few people's screens that didn't work on the return leg and my review would be very different if it was me!

The transfer: you have to collect your baggage just like you're leaving in Delhi, haul it through a maze of very long terminal, actually get out of the freaking airport and then come back in through the front door just like you're taking a domestic flight from Delhi, clearing two different security checks, immigration and customs in the process. Impossible for senior citizens or people with disability. The last thing you need after a 14-hour crappy flight.

Bottom line: You want to save, you want to spend less time traveling. But what a miserable travel you're signing up for!"

Why don't we hear anything about what happened with passengers. There must be Two sided stories for people to understand it. I read more than 6 articles from Air India complaining about issues with passengers. Why don't we have a single story from passenger to vouch his story. Lastly, Air India have pathetic staff who serves everything more than enough including alcohol to avoid having more trips to passengers seats and don't even come back to pick up excessive items. Well this is my view but I think they need to change their behaviour so that we can have a world class flights taking us to the best destination in the world."

We had a flight AI-471 scheduled at 1320 hrs. which got delayed to 1350 hrs. we reached at the Airport at 1245, I understand it's quite late, we got in the queue without the check in luggage with only two hand bags, after standing for half an hour in the queue the staff at the check in counter told us to go to another counter, we went there & showed our tickets, to my surprise the staff told me that the boarding is closed & we cannot check in, I mean after standing for half an hour we are told to go to another counter & then the boarding gets closed....?? I kept on requesting them as I was travelling with my senior citizen mother & as an exception & out of empathy & excellent service they could have let us in for check in & boarding, however the Air India staff showed no empathy & compassion, I understand I was late but not enough late that cannot be considered given that I was travelling with a senior citizen. The Air India staff needs to learn to anticipate & understand the passenger's situation especially when it comes to senior citizens. They should understand the seriousness of the situation, If any senior citizen is travelling, in such a case & exception only the company's level of service & mission could be translated in the way the staff serves to it's customer's. I am extremely disappointed & don' t appreciate such kind of work environment. You could only raise the level of your services & reputation of the company by understanding the customers who don't get late purposely after paying for their tickets, especially with the senior citizens travelling, the staff needs to change their approach & go the next level to make their customers happy & content. Otherwise the company may survive anyhow but their level will always go down."

At the gate, we informed the staff who were actually very switched on and helpful. Not only did they let us pre-board but they also did a thorough clean of our row and of the rows adjacent to us.

On our outward journey to the US, slated for 3rd March 2023, we learnt through sheer chance, at nearly the last moment, without once being informed by the carrier, that the flight had been cancelled. We literally had to move heaven and earth to able to fly from Delhi to Mumbai the following day and then pile into a flight to Newark. The return journey, on April 2nd, was distinguished by our pre-allocated and web-check in seats being changed, at the airport, because these were “unserviceable”. The substitute seats given to us were a disaster. Most controls did not function and the seat jutted out at odd angles besides having tattered upholstery and a food tray that tilted precariously. The sound system, with head phones, functioned poorly. The staff was courteous but forgetful and the food served was good but cold. The on board service was lackadaisical but was redeemed somewhat by the politeness of the cabin crew. The efficiency and comfort that characterises business class travel, in most other airlines, was conspicuous by its absence. Earlier, while boarding, business class travellers were shoved into the long queue of economy and when asked about it, the Air India official at the gate said this was done for the sake of “convenience”. Overall, a sorry experience."

Eight of us travelling together took the Bombay - Nagpur flight on 21st March 2023.

We were transported by coach from Gate 45 to the Airbus 319 plane that has 3-3 seating per row in economy.  The flight was only half full and most passengers sat in comfort occupying either a window or an aisle seat with the middle seat mostly empty.  The leg-space was adequate for me.  There were many mosquitoes within, as we boarded the plane. I was the executioner for quite a few of them! 😍 However, as the air-conditioning took effect, they became less active!

The scheduled take off was 0535. Actual take-off was however delayed until 0555. The flight time was 1 hour 15 minutes.  A snack of a tasty veg sandwiches and mineral water were served during the flight.  Enjoyed watching the sunrise from my window seat.

I don’t know what happened between late January and early March. I had heard rumors that things were going to improve but things seemed to have gone downhill. The food in January was very good but the food in early March was barely edible. The chicken looked so blah and deadly that I dare not touch it. I had gone on a domestic Air India flight from Delhi to Goa on economy and the food was surprisingly excellent. I did not expect inedible food on international business class. 

We had a very comfortable  heavy cover to cover ourselves while resting in the January flight. In the early March flight there was a flimsy useless blanket.

The business class seats have slots for the right size water bottles and we had them in the January flight. In the March flight, they did not have this. Since I like to keep hydrated during a flight I asked for a water bottle and they gave me an oversized one that was cumbersome to keep.

In January I received a charming and absolutely delightful vanity kit that was bursting with goodies - besides the usual things there was a small bar of sandlewood  soap and a small mirror. The vanity case in March was a Tumi case with a couple of generic things. 

What’s going on with Air India. To recap on my international business class flight 
The food that was previously good has gone downhill.
Generic vanity case - earlier charming with plenty of things, 
No bottled water that fits into the slots - earlier we had this.
Thin blankets have replaced the earlier very comfortable covers."

A very comical discovery that really did amuse me, on arrival into the aircraft, I noticed that there was no entertainment system. Whilst sitting in my seat, trying to pass the time (as one does), and exploring my surroundings I noticed that the seat headrest has a seat cover installed over it, underneath there was a redundant video screen, probably from a by-gone era.

We all have valid Visa's to India since we didnt know the dates we would return to UK, we had not booked return tickets also the mother of my children is a Indian National. The front desk forced us to book a inbound return ticket or they wouldn't let us board the aircraft they had recommended to book a ticket to Nepal to show that you would be leaving India. Surprising all the flights available to this destination was Air India & Vistara all a part Tata Group it became so obvious they wanted to make a buck on the tickets we would book .I have travelled several times to India by British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and never was i asked for return tickets also immigration as well in India didnt ask for a return on any occasions when I travelled to India. I am surprised Air India being a part of Tata Group with a high reputation this Kind of practice is allowed. It is so evident they are waiting to take advantage of the situation and con people for money. They started threating mother being Indian can board the flight however my children & I being Foreign European National wont be allowed in-spite of having valid entry visa's to India & can be deported by Immigration on arrival only because we don't have a return ticket. I don't understanding how this can happen mother of my children is Indian and she can stay with them in India till the visa's expires. Also on the entry visa application it is no where mentioned on a granted Visa you need a return this rule looks like is made by Air India and probably is practiced by all air lines that are associated with Tata group. Well I will never travel by Air India in future and also any airlines that is now associated with Air India directly or In directly.

I highly recommend you DO NOT travel with this airline. As a small example, the armrest fell off my seat and I had to put it together at least a dozen times on my flight. Also, there was an old phone that was inside the seat which made it incredibly uncomfortable for me to sit in my seat. The condition of the plane does not do much to make you feel safe traveling. It was a very old and very poorly cared-for plane. As another example, I'm traveling on business and needed to stay a few extra days. They wanted to charge me just about as much to move the flight home a few days as it cost for the entire round-trip ticket to and from the United States. Now I need to pay for a completely different flight with a different airline to get home.  Their policy feels very predatory. I tried calling customer support. They didn't care. I asked to speak to a supervisor. They refused to transfer me to a supervisor. They told me a supervisor would call me but nobody called. I am a frequent traveler between the US and India, but I will strive to not fly on Air India, even if I have to pay substantially more with another airline."

Then we were delayed almost missing our connecting flight. Then it got worst.  I was in the middle seat in the middle row which is normally fine. However, my husbands' seat had springs stabbing into his back for the full 17 hours we were on the plane. My chair would not stay reclined and popped straight up every time I moved making sleep impossible. My friends' tv screen didn't work. When we asked about it 5 different times they said, ""oh all I have to do is reset it in the back."" It never happened. We begged for water from every flight attendant that walked by and never received any unless we walked around to find someone and actually had to hover over them until they handed us water or we would not get any. The movie options were very limited and unheard of. Same with the tv options. No games. No music.

Bathrooms 0/5: pee on the floor everywhere like in dark ages, staff won't attend to it, need to step into a pee puddle basically.

Seats and legroom 1/5: I am 180 so not really tall or long leg range but my knees banged on the seat in front of me the whole time. There was some sort of nasal or oral bugger on the side of my seat which stuck on my fingers when touching the appliances... LOL

Health check not really good, person next to me basically was dying of some sort of cough fix, no-one even cared to ask if she is okay, staff just went by. Luckily I have 5 vaccines for COVID but still fashioned my FFP2 during the flight.

Asking for signature on boarding pass, destination address , weighing of carry- in baggage etc etc are not heard of with any other International Airline. Taking at least 15 min time on average  to clear one individual passenger is Not a very professional approach. All this is synonymous with  bureaucratic attitude.

On 27th Feb 2023 my husband’s grandfather and his aunt flew by Air India from Ahmedabad to Delhi and delhi to unites states. The flight numbers were AI532 and AI105 respectively. While booking the tickets we clearly mentioned that the passenger needs a wheelchair as he is old and sick, but they were not provided with one when they landed Delhi, when asking for help, the crew member did not even had the audacity to provide them with wheelchair, after waiting for long time he was left unattended while she went to get him a wheelchair all by herself. And the worst part of AIR INDIA is they don’t have a diet for patient with diabetes. We booked a economy class ticket for them, but they were also not provided with proper seat, he was provided with the seat towards the end of the airline when we told them to change the seat and give us something v near to the exit, they clearly denied us. We even told them to charge more on our card but they still did not help us. Moreover, the worst part is the original flight schedule was cancelled and they kept on going back and forth about the rescheduled flight times. My grand dad in law was feeling helpless and disrespected by the air India staff. He even cried while waiting for the flight. When arrived in United States his health detoriated and he became even more sick than he was when boarded the flight and was rushed to the hospital last night.

I had to cancel my last domestic flights and rebook all on my own expense literally 24hrs prior to the flight because Air India decided to delay and inform within 24hr of check in. I had a 12hr delay on 14hr flight. It wasn’t cheap to begin with. $1600+ was the amount of the round trip. When I contacted them the dude kept saying, “madam we cannot do anything” and he transferred me to another woman who said she will call back with details regarding extra fare fees if we switch airport to DC instead and she never called back. Their customer service is a joke. I get it that they are lazy and don’t want to work but the fact that international flight had no sense of responsibility whatsoever just amazed me. In Delhi airport, the officer we asked for a lounge access because the flight was delayed from 2AM to 6AM and she was like we cannot give you access it’s only for gold members. What in the world you mean gold members, who would be an idiot to have gold membership with a flight that doesn’t have attitude to show that they r responsible and well punctuality is not even part of the equation. The woman at the airport was rude and didn’t even give us information when we asked okay fine if you don’t want to provide free lounge access for delay can you at least provide us with access if we pay extra. She just straight up said no. Basically, “no we cannot do it” is their service motto. Also, on my way to and back the screen in the flight wasn’t even working. One of the bathroom didn’t even had soap. If you are flying domestic, it’s fine. But if you are considering Air India for your international travel, save your money and time and book with literally anyone else. They don’t compensate whatsoever and or provide any kind of voucher. You don’t want to be traveling alone and all of a sudden find out you have to deal with the stress of getting your next flight canceled and rebook.

2. Boarding at both Chennai and Delhi :  I have never experienced any boarding gate delays. While returning from delhi, there was a delay arriving from other destination, however, all including ground crews acted swiftly and boarded the passengers and baggages quickly. delay of 20 minutes, which i am ok. - my rating 3.5/5

3. Hostess : Good initiative by TATA that they replaced fat belly aunty's with young chaps. Very polite and all smiling face with ""Namaste"" greeings. - my rating 4/5

4. Seat : Pathetic, not much cushioning, feels sitting in a government bus. all seats covers were torned apart. - My rating 2/5

5. In flight Entertainment : Considering the price and the hours in the sky (2.5 to 3 hrs), AI could have provided LCD monitors. domestic policies should be revisited by AI  - My rating 0/5

6. Announcement : Captain announcement were clear and audiable. Glad that captain was telling which route we are travelling (Bhopal, nagpur, hyd and chennai) - My rating 4/5

7. Food : I ordered Diabetic meal and for my daughter i ordered normal veg meal. The first service they start with serving Diabetic passengers first, hats off to AI. However, for Veg meal, the veg salad was not at tasty and mayonnaise spread over the vegetable was spoiled the entire taste. 
The tea they served is like Indian railways Rs.10 tea, very watery. Coffee was good. This we experienced To and Fro. - My rating 3.5/5

My opinioin,  still they are far away compared to other private jets. but improving slowly.

My flight from Chicago to Ahmedabad was the worst flight I have ever had in my life.  My flight was delayed for hours due to weather conditions which is understandable and I am not upset about that but everything on the flight was broken. It seemed like a broken down plane. My wife's tray table was broken so eating for her 16 hour flight was difficult and for some reason her meal was veg oriental which is not what we wanted and we were told we had to take that and not change. My headphones were barely working but I suspect it was not the headphones but the plug-in connection as I had tried multiple headphones.  My TV would randomly blank out or go to a completely green screen. Also completely stop working if there was an announcement.  There was a very very limited amount of options to view movies or TV shows with my barely working headphone and TV screen that would randomly stop working.  My wife's TV DID NOT WORK AT ALL. NO TV FOR A 16 HOUR FLIGHT. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. I asked to move to have a seat with a TV and was told the other seats would not have TVs either. WHAT? There were so many things wrong with this flight.  Many things I understand were not the fault of Air India such as there were so many crying babies. The kids sitting behind me repeatedly kept kicking my seat. The guy in front of me fought with the air hostess becaause he wanted whiskey. I don't blame Air India for these things things.

Not always the perfect experience but then which airline gives the perfect experience 100 pct of the time ? Anyway, flew Air India for the first time after Tata takeover on Feb 15 2023 from Newark to Mumbai. Flight took o off 5 min earlier than scheduled. Full flight in Economy. The flying was excellent and smooth - takeoff, landing and turbulence handling all very expertly maneuvered. The service was equally smooth and efficient. Air India staff was always the best and still is. The toilets were clean throughout the flight. I saw a staff cleaning a toilet. The food was excellent, Air India food was always the best, and still is. Seats were comfortable. Air India seating was always less cramped compared to other airlines, and still is. The aircraft was old so the entertainment sets were not working. But to me not a deal breaker with so much else going well. With the new fleet that will also be fixed. As the pilot said after every announcement, Namaskaar and Jai Hind."

Caring

After leaving home at 3 am for 5:45 am flight 
Breakfast at 6 am was just 2 veg mayo cabbage 👎 sandwich and water

No coffee juice 

Flyers are sleepy and need coffee tea juice to waky waky 

But that’s air india fault not the crew’s 

As I said everyone was wonderful 

The landing was rough jerks

No apologies 
I guess they did their job reaching your destination in one whole piece 

Mangalore airport and staff are wonderful too

I noted that the airport pre booked taxies are more expensive than Mumbai 

For a 25 minute ride at 7:45 am I  was charged 700
Whereas for the  same Distance I Mumbai was charged 375 at 3 am  by ola

They are partnered with United Airlines and because we purchased our tickets with United Miles, our flights in and out of India were operated by AI. The planes were all disgusting. I'm glad I didn't splurge on business or first class because there would be no point to it. I would never want to ""lie down"" on one of those seats. The upholstery is tattered, smells like excrement, bathrooms were disgusting. Toilet paper ran out on a long haul flight and no one resupplied it. They were SO stingy with providing drinking water on a 10 hour flight. Like subhuman treatment. Actual PIECES of the airplane's interior trim were coming apart, on one of our segments.  I thought the Tata acquisition would improve things, but this embarrassing mess is just so on-brand for Indian politics\business as usual."

Don't make the mistake of imagining that these dollars will even let u reserve ur preferred seat in economy, u have pay extra CAD60+ for a window seat or CAD20+ for others. Also, bring your own entertainment for 14hrs long journey coz there entertainment system it beyond our expectations. Their screen shows air India's vibrant orange colour  for the whole flight (doesn't even shut down) which says "" This selection is not currently available. Please try again later"" , so by the end of this 14hr journey in air reading this you would start hating the orange colour or promise yourself for life u won't sit in this flight or may be both. 
What should I say about food, u will be served tea in most hygienic cups of worst quality plastic. Rest eat it at your own risk.

Last time when I travelled with AI it was under government authorization and price was around CAD1800. That was much better experience. I expected much from its privatization as the fare increased almost 2-fold but the quality has only degraded. Tata is following the policy of cost reduction to its very end. Feels like sitting in a Punjab mail. Nothing to do so people are just talking and wandering around just to pass time. 1 minute is like an hour. 

If this the flight is taking any tourists to India, they are definitely getting the impression of slum dog millionaire. This flight reflects poverty from every angle."

AI0489 Delhi to Surat 

Air India removed us from our flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. the next flight is a whole 24 hours later. because THEY CHOSE TO GIVE MY SEAT AWAY. I am stuck in Delhi FOR 24 HOURS.. I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic man by the name of Sarvish was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. 

We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. 

Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. I want a full explanation of why i was denied boarding. 

Were we sidelined because we are foreigners? Is this what Air India is about?  

They lost our baggage on another flight and then discriminated against us on this flight. They ruined my entire trip. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service.  No responsibility. No accountability. No explanations given. I want to file a lawsuit against them."

This came after flying AI381 (787 Dreamliner) in the opposite direction a few days prior. To put things mildly after the experience I have had I would expect to be paid to take this flight as opposed to paying any sum for it whatsoever and the audacity they have to offer a business upgrade on a bidding system is fundamentally disgusting. I flew in economy and this “star alliance” carrier wasted no time in reminding me of the same. We were greeted by seats that were textured like sandpaper with knee room suitable for a toddler. This was further bolstered by splatters of curry all over the seat back and armrests with a cheeky grain of basmati or two to punctuate the morbid scene we were in. A particular highlight came right after the inflight meal which included a slice of cake that would be excellent if you enjoy a slab of unsalted butter on an abrasive kitchen sponge. While the clearly vexed steward cleared our trays he told us to keep our bottles of water for them to clear at a later time. The only problem is this park bench of a seating arrangement did not come with any storage space below the tray-table or otherwise which therefore bestowed us with the privilege of developing sweaty palms as we clutched these 200ml PET bottles like they were bottles of petrol in the current energy crisis. All in all the irony that this plane had a maharaja class a mere few feet away was amusing and the fact that this is India’s national carrier made me very proud to be Singaporean. Will not recommend, either fly Indigo or get your cash up. 

P.S. the person in front of me tilted their seat back and I found myself in a full padmasan for half an hour after in a forced yoga session."

OLD AND DIRTY AIRPLANE

Food was terrible!  My entertainment screen didnt work properly. So eager to get out of the plane I left a very expensive jacket behind. Wrote to air india 7 times , response took two weeks, jacket lost , no apology,  
On the flight back to London from Kochin on the 3rd of February the plane was slighly better but filthy, crumbs and grime everywhere. We had paid for leg room again and this time  we were near the kitchen, where it was obvious there were some staff tensions. The male attendant (that's an overstatement)  was incredibly lazy.  He never explained the procedures for emergency door (I was sitting next to it) and he spent at least 9 hours with his hands in his pockets, checking his phone  whilst slamming (i dont exaggerate) each door, drawer, and cabinet constantly , so bad that I had to ask him to stop. Lots of babies around that he almost enjoyed waking?  It felt like he didnt really wanted to be there, but as a passenger in the air , his behaviour was slightly unnerving . Being a 12 hour flight , there was never  a care from the team for the passengers to manage rest, there was almost zero hospitality, just dumping some terrible food on our trays , and retrieving them.

"2023-02-01T06:01:31-05:00","3","review","2","Here is my Most Honest Review","I had booked Air India because there was a direct option, and this was before I had read all the horror stories online. I was dreading my vacation - I travel frequently both domestic and international and this was the first time I've felt travel anxiety because of everything I have read. I was genuinely concerned I might miss my connection on the flight back or lose my bags or the flights would get canceled without any reason and before I got into much more detail of everything, none of that happened.

Here is the truth - no one is going to write about their mediocre experience. And after flying, it's hard to imagine too many people having an overwhelmingly positive experience with Air India, so it makes sense why all the reviews are bad.

For Context here is my itinerary:
Washington Dulles (IAD) to Delhi (DEL)
DEL to Mumbai (BOM)
BOM to DEL to IAD

IAD to DEL
1 day before, they emailed saying the flight schedule changed from 10 AM to 12PM. No big deal but I remember thinking ""crap its all coming true"". Once finally at the airport, it was time to board and they made an announcement for everyone to sit down because the flight is delayed by ""1 or 2 hours we don't know"". They needed to change the tire. After 2 hours they gave us free meal vouchers to use at the airport. What made the process annoying is besides just asking the people at the ticket counter, there were no updates via the app/on screen so we were kind of just on stand by. By 3:30 PM we took off so that was a delay of 5 hours (2 of which were anticipated).

Prior to the trip, I booked seat 11C (exit row) and when I got my boarding pass at the airport, I had 29C which wasn't an exit row. The lady at the gate counter got me an exit row seat when I explained the situation (but not the same one I paid for, which I didn't care about).

DEL to BOM
No issues here. Flight was on time, bags made it ok.

BOM to DEL
This flight was delayed by about 30 min because they were waiting for the crew from the returning flight. Again, it was just annoying that the time wasn't updated on the app/in-person so you're just left waiting. Someone had puked in the bathroom sink. Not sure if the staff were informed or not. Also this plane was extremely old but the flight is 1hr40 min so who cares.

DEL to IAD
Flight was delayed by about an hour. They did not say why. However, we only arrived 15 min after scheduled arrival

General Positive Feedback
-Seats go back a good amount
-I read a lot of reviews of staff being very unfriendly, I didn't have that experience. I thought they were just as good as any other airline.
-No issues with bags being delayed/lost
-No missed connections
-They had a lot of on-board food (even on the short domestic flight) felt like they were giving a meal or snack or tea/coffee every few hours which was appreciated. I brought my own food because i'm picky so i barely touched the food but it tasted exactly what airline quality food should taste like.
-I did get text confirmations about baggage being received
-2 free checked bags

General Negative Feedback
-The app/website sucks. Takes forever to load. Would check me in but not give me a boarding pass
-No real time updates on Google.
-Didn't frequently update the screens at the airport with real-time flight info
-changes to gates/schedule change came to my email only
-I brought my own entertainment. The infotainment looked old and limited with movies but it looked like everyones was mostly working just fine
-Planes definitely were outdated but ""filthy"" ""Disgusting"" is a bit of an exaggeration 
-their general operations do seem a bit chaotic. During the delayed flights there were like 20 people at the counter trying to figure out what was going on."

I paid 5000/- by google pay and the amount got deducted in no time from my bank account. Google pay also showed payment success message. But airline counter at the airport did not receive it. They checked with concerned agents and said the same thing that the amount has not been received at their end. I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for this confirmation. Then they asked me to pay by cash. I had no choice so I paid 5000/- by cash. Means I paid 5000/- twice once by google pay and once by cash. They told me I will get the refund automatically if that google pay payment gets credited to their account later. They also asked me to check with my bank. I called my bank the very next day and they said that the amount of 5000/- has been credited to Ghodawat Enterprises(Star Air) account at midnight. Ever since I am calling Star Air customer care, writing emails and following up with Indore airport staff as well. But everytime I get an unsatisfactory reply that we will check and revert.

Its is humiliating that everything being digital they are not able to catch the excess amount of 5000/- in their account?
What should I term this..carelessness/ fraud?

I would not recommend star air to anyone.

Phones are not answered and emails either are wrong or no answer to an inquiry.  At last, I called SFO airport customer service phone and they told me that it's very hard to get a hold on Air India, their voicemail is mostly full, and they do not reply to calls/voicemails.  SFO airport customer service advised me to come to  airport and talk to the manager.  SFO airport is two hours away from my place but I managed to go.  I spoke with two managers, Geeta Chandrashekar and Sandeep Singh, who assured me that they have a tracking system and will get back to me.  I had life threatening medications in the bag.  I explained it to both of them.  Geeta told me to send her the names of the medications so that she can arrange it from somewhere else.  But it was just an excuse because she denied it when I asked for it again.  I was told in the 2nd week of December that they could not find it and I can claim it.  I was told to send them the list of items I had in the bag.  I sent them the list of items, on December 15, 2022.  On December 30, I received an email letting me know that they are willing to compensate $120 for the bag.  I spoke with Geeta and asked how they came up with the amount and she did not have an answer and told me that she will talk to higher authorities to reconsider it.  I received another email on January 4th letting me know that they are now willing to compensate $360.  I spoke with Geeta and asked her to justify it and satisfy me with the amount.  She did not have an explanation but showed an attitude like I have done a crime flying with Air India.  This is nowhere close to the amount of compensation for a lost bag per the U.S. Department of Transportation.  I am so frustrated with the services provided and the way my claim was handled.  On January 6th, I received a call from unknown number from bay area that they have my bag.  That guy said he got it from the airport by mistake.

I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a callback. Then I called again and the phone was answered by Shreyas. I was on hold for more than 20 mins with no solution. Then they transferred my call to some manager who never answered."

My mother suffers from diabetics only for that reason i wanted to visit the washroom with her..the lady crews had intentionally turned on occupied button from inside without anyone inside and did not let us use it.the other washroom did not have water it was all dirty.Pathetic service and complete waste of money.i think these crews how did they become certified as they lack minimum integrity and honesty while serving customers.
I think they have taken the customers for granted because we have hardly any option for traveling to jfk.
I would not have been so rude if this set of same ladies who behaved mean on our way to jfk on 22nd Dec 2022 from del and from jfk to del on 21st jan2023. Same set of ladies who are dishonest and lacks integrity issues.
Suggestion to air india team have some respect for the old people and also to the management build a separate washroom for staff so that they don't have to fake things...
On the other hand the flight from del to kolkata had crew of hosts and all the gentlemen were extremely kind and helpful. Then how come these shivani and gauravs team from jfk to kol was so reckless and the team from del to kol is so gentle.The airline in same then i think training needs to be same as well.

Everything from check in to seating was terrible. Long queues at Melbourne and Delhi airport for check in as the staff was taking too long to process the check ins and this is despite doing a web check in and just queuing to get our boarding passes and dropping off our baggage. 

The inflight entertainment service did not work, the seats did not recline, the hygiene and cleanliness was terrible, food from previous flight was found on my seat belt and food tray, rubbish from previous flight was still in the front pocket of my seat, there was no toilet paper in one of the toilets, the other toilet's door was not locking. The meals were distasteful and the main meals from Mel to Del only had carbs (Rice). 

Ground staff was very rude to a lady who requested for a bassinet for her child but was not provided with one enroute Melbourne to Delhi. 

The tickets costed us 6000 AUD round trip and the service was not even close to the amount we paid. The 787 dreamliners looked old and ready to retire.  Being the national carrier of India I had expected some decent level of service from them.

Air India needs a good amount of wind beneath its wings to be at par with the other international airlines. I will not travel with this airline again and would not recommend anyone as well."

So they charged around 1600 Rs for my baby's tickets that allowed check in luggage upto 10kgs and a stroller as hand baggage but because they upgraded us to a seat that has the bassinet, my husband and mother in law had to pre book their seats just beside me costing to INR 2000. I fed my baby and put her to sleep but when we entered the flight and could not find the bassinet, the crew just came and apologized for it stating that particular aircraft didn't have a bassinet. We weren't mentally prepared for this and by baby started like crazy, continuously for an hour, inconsolably, we couldn't do much in a moving flight and by sitting in our own seats. On top of that, when I asked for an infant seat belt, their air hostess throws an attitude and mentions that they don't recommend the same!!
Can u believe it? When did seat belt for anyone become a CHOICE and not mandatory?
As you can see in the attached image that there is too much space in front of our seats due to the imaginary bassinet in which we were supposed to keep our baby, imagine there's turbulence and no infant seat belt, I as a mother, can think of unimaginable things.. 
They didn't even refund any amount ... And getting that refund would take closely 20 email exchanges, few tweets.. Hence, please note

I was amazed at how tasteless the food has become on both my outbound Flight 888 and this return. 
-- Under-salted
-- No trace of oils which confers taste
-- Instead of the former tasty sauces, now chicken or vegetables only in tomato ketchup.  Awful.
-- The chicken pieces cleaned of ketchup, themselves had no taste
-- The vegetables and chicken tasted stale, as if purchased past expiry date.

This is a self-inflicted wound on an airline that under previous ownership at least had tasty food. What could be the reason?
A. Foolishly observing nutritional fads such as ""vegan"" or serving bland hospital-quality food??
B. Extreme cost cutting??
Whatever the reason, it seems from previous reviews, this nonsense will hurt Air India, especially with Asians who are taste-conscious.

We want Air India to succeed. So abandon the faddish, health-conscious approach. A few can order special meals. for the majority of flyers, they at least want some taste (yes, traditional Indian recipies with salt, oil and other ingredients)."

I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. 

My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit. 
1. How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple. 
2. Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air india can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. 

Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues!!! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. 

Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. 

Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment AGAIN. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. 
Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. 

Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. 

We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. 

Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. 

So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed.

I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. 

Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. 

WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. 

after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE. 
1. Why is it not being made clear to your customers about IMPORTANT UPCOMING FLIGHT CHANGES.

2. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. 

In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions. 

Therefore I would request a some compensation to be given on the following. 

1. Level of flight service for my flight on 23-11-22. No entertainment system. 

2. Return flight again level of service no entertainment system and no other option given. For both myself and my mother. 

3. Change of flights , no notification of cancellation and rerouting. 11 hour wait instead of 4 for my sisters flight on 15-11. 

I am happy to provide our flight tickets confirmations and pictures and videos that I took during my travel on your planes. 

I would appreciate your assistance and timely response. 

As stated I will definitely will not be travelling with Air India in the future and travel vouchers would not be of any use. 

I look forward to hearing from you please do not hesitate to reach out if you require further information."

The food is borderline garbage and on the return journey I ended up violently vomiting for a day – and that was the only thing I'd eaten. 

My entertainment screen on the return journey didn't work at all and when I removed the remote control the whole thing fell apart. I left the pieces on the floor.

I have spent all night in Delhi airport as I have to catch the next day flight to Hyderabad. The inflight service was good but the ground staff were so irresponsible and rude.Not a good experience."

Otherwise everything in the plane is broken, literally!
Only a 1/3 of the TVs worked no headphones provided probably because most of the TVs didn't work, many seats, trays plugs lights etc didn't work. I ve seen occasionally before 1 or 2 seats broken in a plane but never on this scale! Plane needs complete refurbishment or retirement.
If Air India are offering the cheapest ticket by at least a couple of 100 hundred quid then book and take your own entertainment snacks, and headphones etc. Expect nothing from the plane.

You get one drink either whiskey or wine nil else on offer. Dinner was OK, breakfast best left alone. Whilst in India an Air India scandal broke in the news that a drunk passenger urinated on passengers and there may have been several instances like this on AI flights. This may make them restrict drinks further. 

Air India are being taken over and will improve, they were pretty decent before, like 8 years ago.

So just check aeroplane number."

They charged my card never gave me the receipt when I asked they said they will email me never received the receipt. Asked them to put the shopping in to the duty free shopping bag again but the Duty manager and supervisor won’t listen, insulted me, bullied me, humiliated me again and again in front of about 8-10 of your staff,  threatened me to not to let me board and remove me from that flight.

(Both your manager and supervisor were from Indian Asian ethnicity, when I asked the names none of them were ready to give me their names!!!)
I already complained to flight supervisor because even after paying My bags didn’t have space in over head compartments, so one I had to keep it under my seat and another one far away.

I have sent couple of emails to log the complaints and automated response said someone will get in touch within 24 hours but it’s been more tha 15 days no response whatsoever."

On the plus side, the food was very good. I enjoyed the Indian vegetarian meal (I’m not Indian so I may have enjoyed it more that someone who regularly eats Indian home cooking.) and my husband’s salmon was quite good. The flight attendants were friendly and responsive. On the other hand, the planes are very, very old. Our business class seats were comfortable and it was very nice to lie down but there was very little storage by the seats, as opposed to newer seats that have a place for glasses, reading material, or a small purse, so I placed them on the floor by my feet. The worst part is the entertainment system. It didn’t work properly and had to be rebooted several times. And this is after they moved us because my original seat was “broken”. The charging outlet also didn’t work.  I want to add that my husband flew the same route in 2019 and had the same issues with the seat and entertainment system. The flight attendant submitted the complaint but there was never any follow up or compensation. 
Air India was cheaper and got us to our destination directly instead of having to change planes in Europe We got there on time and I got good food and some sleep on the plane. The planes are very old and have problems that could be expected for that age. The flight attendants are good but don’t expect any corporate response to problems you have with the flight or seat so judge for yourself if the pros outweigh the cons."

At check-in in Washington DC, the staff seemed new but there were two managers who were stepping in to help where needed. I have TSA pre so had to approach them to get that added to my boarding card.

Boarding at Washington Dc was a bit chaotic and it seems to be outsourced. Once you enter the 787 Dreamliner the experience is great. I like the uniforms and the greeting from the crew was very genuine.
As people boarded a few of the elderly passengers wanted water and the demand was fulfilled with a smile. The overhead bins were spacious and there was enough room for my carry-on as were the others.

The seats were comfortable, I felt like they have more space than other airlines. Meal service was fast, and I feel that the passenger-to-crew ratio is higher. The food was good and very much Indian plus I like the fact that there was plain yogurt with the main meals. People felt free to walk up to the galleys and ask for water, a drink or a snack.  In economy Air India has beer ( Heiniken and Bavaria) wine and whiskey (Ballantynes). I didn't get my vodka tonic which I thought would help me sleep!

2 main meals and a snack before landing in Delhi. I wasn't happy with the croissants
 with cheese and wished that I had packed some snacks as I was still hungry. 

Coffee was pretty bad and tea was nice. 

The entertainment center choice was good but then the touchscreens did not work well to touch. The volume at the lowest setting was too high. 

I enjoyed the crew taking good care of us and my fellow passengers. Nothing was refused and follow-up was excellent. Many of the passengers felt comfortable with the multilingual crew.

i will vote with my money and if I find my next flight to India is competitively priced , I will choose Air India again."

-Crew on the flight was nice.
-Food was excellent.
-Flight departed and arrived on time.

The bad:
-The seat was very uncomfortable, even for economy class!
-The bathroom had no toilet paper and a clogged sink.
-The screen did not work. Nor did the screen for the neighboring seat.
-They lost my checked bag and their customer service on the phone and at the airport constantly gives me conflicting instructions. Once I realized the bag did not arrive, an Air India staff member gave me a brief form to fill out with my bag ID and contact information. I was then told to return to the airport the next morning. The bag was not there. Their phone representative informed me that I should have received a file number, but was never given one when I filled out the form. I was then told to return to the airport yet again to file a complaint and receive the number. The man at the airport desk told me to e-mail bdq.apt@airindia.com. They have yet to reply. A customer service rep did eventually call on the fourth day, then requested more time to search and asked to call back later. They have refused to provide a file number and the staff at the airport and on the phone are not helpful. 

I will never fly on Air India again after this experience. I was reading about their financial troubles and have 0 sympathy. As far as I am concerned, the trouble are deserved."

I’ve travelled nearly all my life, and can say with complete confidence now, that Air India can star in the top 10 list of the worst airlines ever, and this is after it was owned by Tata.

Air India was the only airline where passengers 'totally' ignored mandatory mask wearing. Attendants wore them and there was little or no indication that they tried to 'encourage' passengers to wear masks. It was ironic that the in-plane recorded message about not wearing masks would result in either removal from flight or penalties - neither happened. Wrong messages sent and passengers shouldn't be allowed onboard without one. Vistara and Indigo Air had no problems with their passengers meeting obligations and safety measures - how can Air India not do so - failure in responsibility. The comment is for this flight only.

We were not the only ones affected there were lots of others who just wanted to get to the destination straight away. The stopover is not too bad but when I spoke to another person on the same flight they said that there was a 10 hour flight time wait and on the way back to London there is a 16 hour wait in Delhi. The worst factor is that my mum did not even get on the flight and they are already causing problems with flights.  If this airline wants to thrive they need to seriously reconsider the services they offer because they were not able to commit to what they said they would which was a direct flight to Ahmedabad in this case.

Recently I had to plan a travel to DXB and booked myself in Economy assuming I can upgrade myself to Business using miles. 

I was surprised that there is no official way to redeem miles available online, one can only dial AIR INDIA customer care and do the needful, on every occasion that I made the call I was assured of a call back which never happened. After getting fed up with waiting, I also complained to Air India on the official Twitter account and they also assured a callback. this time a call back happened to say that they will have someone call from the FFP team call me, which again did not happen. 

On repeated reminders on the Twitter account, I got a call saying that an upgrade is not possible since there are no seats available and can be checked at the airport. When I reached the airport, the ground staff clearly refused that no upgrade against miles is possible at the airport.

Again no response from the twitter team or customer care team.

On my return flight, they once again told me an upgrade is not possible since no seats were available. as expected, i went online on-air Indias app and keyed in my flight details, and checked availability which showed 5 seats available. I shared the screenshot also with AIR INDIA customer care, but as expected there was no response.

I don't understand what are AIRLINE MILES meant for... the intention of the airline is to sell tickets and not redeem miles.. this is simply cheating and misrepresentation to travelers and not the case with most other airlines.

Booking Experience on Air India website ----->
surprisingly this was fine. shortest flight time and 2 free check in bags was the ONLY reason i chose Air india over emirates/united. but honestly, now i regret that decision a lot.

A personal Misfortune ----->
just 2 days before the departure flight (1st leg of journey) i somehow got caught with COVID. I informed the air india customer care, they changed my ticket to open ticket (this is all good btw). But when i was well and fit to fly, i had to pay additional fee to rebook the date which is against the rules as per the "" Amended Covid 19 Waiver dated 21 May 2021"" which has been posted on Air india website. It clearly says that if there is an availability of seat in the same class of travel as previously booked, there is no fare difference to be charged. Due to time constraints and covid related weakness i did not have the energy to fight with them at that moment and i had to pay the fare difference. Upon reaching the customer care again, to my surprise the girl on the phone understood the issue and assured me a refund ( to be processed in time). However, that never happened and later they withdrew that statement. This is not just bad but also ILLEGAL. I have processed the legal action now. 

Online Check In ---->
Ok. this part is weird with Air India. Despite having an online boarding pass with me, my efforts on getting myself checked in ONLINE were futile. They simply dismissed my check in and boarding pass and rejected it. I had to check in at the counter all over again. I believe it happened to everyone (that day at least).

The onward flight from Delhi to EWR ----->

Seats Broken, Remotes all broken, screens not working, food service (presentation) was terrible. It was equivalent to some of the food service we get in trains like Shatabdi in India. I would rate the train service better. 
Food quantity was just adequate may be. ( certainly not ok for diabetics if any) Snack packets were on the seats at the time of boarding. I havent seen that before in any other carrier. 
Quality of snacks - not so good but safe to eat for sure.  
Crew was OK, may be understaffed but trying to accommodate. 
Flight reached on time. 
Baggage was ok so far. 
Overall a bad experience but yet not disastrous. 

The Return Journey (EWR to Delhi) Nov 7, 2022

Check in only at the counter, i didnt even try the online based on my prev experience and rightly so. (coz it wouldnt have worked). BTW the terminal for Airindia is different that United in many ways. Baggage was taken at the counter - not on the belt but just being stacked at the corner of check in counters. This was weird too. 
Security check was long and ardous. No special que for differently abled or people on wheelchairs ( felt bad for them). NO Special ques or CLEAR pass or anything Valid in this terminal. 

Plane 777 300 ER -  Very Old aircraft

Seats - Broken, clear signs of spillage, my seat's arm rest was broken and lying on the floor. No reclining. Remotes never worked in almost all the seats. Tray was broken and things were sliding down the tray table. Screens were broken, certainly no sound but not working at all. 
Flight was delayed by 2 hours as many passengers complained of spillage on their seats and ground staff was called for cleaning and attempt to drying the seats.   

Food Service (presentation) was Awful as expected. 
No Snacks on seats this time.
Quality of food - taste awful, but may be it can be termed ""safe"" to eat (Not sure though).
In a fourteen hour flight with 2 hours of delay, there were only two food services, which was terrible especially for the elderly diabetic sitting next to me. Thank god she had a glucose sensor placed on her arm and it sensed the hypoglycemia setting in on her. I was able help her with glucose tablets and water (FYI this is the best thing to do in such events).

Nursing mothers on the flight with babies were left to their despair, food was not served to one of them. Crew was not good. certainly understaffed for a full flight but not able to accommodate either. 

Landing was ok.

(Disclaimer - I am an Indian citizen, live in delhi and very well aware of the Airport services in Delhi. T3 is an enormously large terminal with no possible shortage of any kind of services as far as infrastructure is concerned. if there is any lack anywhere, it can only be attributable to lack of staff, lack of management and lack of intentions mostly)    

Baggage Service was Terrible and Very Weird at delhi airport. For some reason (clearly not understood by me), the baggage staff at the delhi airport were taking off all the baggages from the belt and stacking them on the floor, while the belt was running EMPTY. 
OK. This is disastrous on many levels --->, bags get extremely difficult to locate especially when they are so many in numbers and stacked in a corner. Due to chaos, people were pounding on each other to find their bags. people on wheelchair had no chance to find their bags at all. god knows what was done about that. One of my bags was severely damaged - probably bcoz of this activity.     
I went to the baggage counter to register a PIR (property irregularity report), you must get this in case u find your baggage damaged. Till date i havent heard back from them. No replacements or repairs done so far.

Overall experience - terrible is an understatement. I paid about 1600$ for the return flight and will certainly recommend AGAINST flying AIR INDIA especially international flights to anyone. If you have any special needs - travelling with babies, wheel chair assistance etc- Flying Air india could be dangerous.

I have no clue why many people are way too excited about TATAs acquiring this airlines and are highly optimistic of an improvement in this carrier. Insider news is that TATA is never going to do anything on ground as yet. the transition has happened only on papers and they are preparing for another one with a possible merger with Vistara. Honestly, i just hope it doesnt affect Vistara's quality which by far is an excellent carrier - atleast domestically. i love their premium economy services."

I've never had such abysmal service and couldn't believe the lack of empathy or care from everyone working there. I'd organised emergency repatriation home to Australia because my partner had contracted acute viral hepatitis and wasn't getting the care he needed in hospital there. We'd caught a domestic flight to Delhi then booked the Holiday Inn Express inside Delhi airport (side note: do NOT book there, the service was even worse than Air India) for the night, because our flight to Sydney didn't leave until midday the following day. We couldn't find the Holiday Inn Express but were told to go to the Air India counter and they would call the hotel and ask someone to come and escort us inside, as we weren't allowed in the airport before check-in time opened unless escorted by someone from the hotel. Air India told us to call the hotel. I did, they refused to listen, hung up on me, and refused to answer any of my calls. My partner was passed out on the floor and desperately needed somewhere to stay. I told Air India staff how sick he was and that we were ending our trip early to get him to hospital in Australia and he needed a room for tonight. They shrugged, and refused to help. Only when I started crying did they attempt to call the hotel, but after two attempts and no answer, they refused all other help. We were their customers the following day, and everyone we spoke to told us that Air India was who we saw to help us with getting to the hotel. I tried to contact the hotel for TWO HOURS and continually asked for Air India's help before giving up and catching a taxi to another hotel. The following day our flight had been delayed by 4hours. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable and small, the service was poor, the plane smelt unclean, the toilets were filthy (although that was the fault of all the customers), and the in-flight entertainment was incredibly limited with poor choices for a 13hr $2000 flight. I will never fly Air India again and advise you to find another airline."

They will cancel your flight and never notify you via text or email. When you arrive at the airport. That’s when you find out your flight has been cancelled.. but then you can’t leave the airport. So you’re stuck there. And while you wait for your flight… you find out the flights been delayed another 5 hours… I spent 18 hours at the airport waiting for my flight to finally take off. We also sat on the tarmac for 1.5 hours. And again for another 1 hour once we landed. The WORST experience! Waste of time. But on top of it. The people at the service desk do not care about you. They won’t help you. People are extremely rude. Completely unreliable! 

I just wanted to get home. And they kept stopping me at every security check point. Even right before you board your flight. They had to make a phone call regarding my passport.. but with no explanation.

There was nothing on the electronic boards in the airport. Chaotic scenes all around,  the customer service officer (Pramod S) was offering no option other than asking the passengers to get refund; but he did not know where to get the refund.  After two hours at the airport and no chance of any realistic alternative option, we took a taxi and came to hotel. Spoke to their representative (female, name starting with Lixxx) around 9:30 am. She cancelled our booking on the return flight from Aurangabad to Mumbai, and offered to refund the fare after 21 days; let's see. We asked for an email stating that the flight was cancelled so we could take up with our insurance company and also inform our employer. Lixxx said that the airlines policy precludes issuance of an email. There was nothing on the electronic display boards in the airport. So I have no proof to show to the employer, no written communication from them, and yet I am paying hefty hotel charges.

I am a customer from the UK, right from the onset I have had horrific problems with Air India, and not just myself but multiple passengers !!!!

1. On the outward journey passengers were made to wait at the airport for over 12 hours with differing information, snd mostly they are fixing the problem, and will be resolved within an hour....this continued for 12 hours. I recorded everything, lies upon lies, to the extent that a blind man was left neglected, the elderly struggling, and apprehensive, snd people were in tears. One lady had had a cancer operation, was so sick yet they didnt care. 

The flight was eventually cancelled and it was ultimate chaos. The manger of Air India rebooked the flight for the following day, the 31st of October. In addition, on my ticket I had an option of one FREE change for the same class/status flight. I also lost several days of my travel. The aircraft was old tatty, cramped seats and the television didn't work. Staff ignored my request to fix it and thr food very poor.

2. Due to the above delay I wanted to extend our stay and utilise the ONE FREE CHANGE. To my shock and horror i realised there is no sense of customer service, having made 32 calls,  disconnected multiple times, and proposing to charge me £250.00 plus penalties to change my partners flight date when it should have been FREE. Every advisor provided differing information and fees. Eventually I settled on 4500 rupees which is £45.00 after spending several days and nights on call to them ! I have a written log, and my calls are recorded, 

3. Today, I spoke to several advisers (Shabnum, Vishali (wouldnt even transfer my call to a supervisor as she was lying), and then Rohit. Again, all providing differing information. From 19765 rupees to 3000 rupees,. I agreed to pay 3000, the payment was taken snd the ticket issued. The advisor also checked both manually and the general system. I was informed that it is the same class status flight and time just different date. The ticket, and payment went through fine.

Several hours later I recieved a call from Air India SANJAY KASHYAP. (acting supervisor) claiming that there had been an error and I now need to pay 19765 rupees. WHAT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AND THE HEIGHT OF CORRUPTION.

PLEASE NOTE  the same issue happened with my partner previously.

I REFUSED to pay the additional as its a contractual agreement. Even if there were a system error then it should be HONOURED as the payment had been made AND a ticket issued. Sanjay Kashyap threatened that my ticket will be cancelled if I don't pay. So abrupt and rude.

Furthermore, If there was an ACTUAL ERROR MY PAYMENT IT WOULD NOT HAVE GONE THROUGH.

I have lost all sense of patience with these people now, and am pursuing this matter through Government official Ministers, the head of the Police department and a LENGHTLY AND DETAILED CONPLAINT TO TATA group directly. WITH EVIDENCE. I shall also post a full account of the disruption/corruption that I have experienced on Facebook.

This is certainly not the end. Every advisor provides different prices, and information within 5 minutes of calling one after another.

PLEASE DO DO NOT DESTROY YOUR HOLIDAY OR YOUR SENSE OF SANITY BY FLYING WITH AIR INDIA. THEY HAVE A REPUTATION TO DECEIVE THEIR CUSTOMERS.

PLEASE BE AWARE !"

Not a good experience. Air India has a very long way to go to catch up with other international airlines in terms of service. 

The overall impression was of sloth and carelessness. Seats were cramped, the tray table was grubby and kept falling open mid flight, the In flight entertainment didn’t work and neither did the USB charging port. Lots of maintenance work is needed. Food standards have also fallen. A 15 hour flight that left in the morning hours ought to have had more than 2 flimsy meals and a bag of chips. The food was stale and tasteless. In the past at least the food used to be good. 

One strange thing I noticed was that the air hostesses uniforms had not had any update since my last flight over 20 years ago. Not a huge point but I noticed it and I wonder if that is also because nobody really cares about this airline. 

In all fairness this would not be a review without acknowledging what is good - I have to praise the pilots’ skill in bringing me safely on a 15 hour journey across the globe. It is not a joke to have the responsibility of more than 300 souls in your hands. The flight crew on the whole were courteous and pleasant. So thanks is due where it is due. 

The airport experience at Delhi is another nightmare altogether and that will be its own review. Air India has a role to play to make things smoother for its passengers where transfers are concerned but it did a very sloppy job."

The London to Dehli legs were on a 787 which, despite being a fairly new aircraft, looked tired.  The power sockets didn't work, the screens were temperamental, and some of the fittings were quite worn already.  The seat itself was perfectly comfortable, a bit like how the first class cabins of the 70s and early 80s used to be (before business class was invented).  It was a bit nostalgic in some respects.

The food was OK, but not great and certainly not up to the same standards as other business class offerings.  The menus were on photocopied sheets of paper that had obviously been used a few times.

The cabin crew, however, were good; courteous, helpful and attentive.

The Dehli to Singapore legs were on A320s, which was a much less pleasant experience.  Despite this being a 5-6 hour flight, there was no in flight entertainment and the leg room was about the same as BA premium economy.  Although shorter than the London leg, this was more of an endurance test.

The Air India lounge in Dehli was decent.  A good range of food and drinks, not busy, and there were leather fully reclining seats which I took full advantage of when arriving at 3am on the return leg for the 6 hour layover.  In London and Singapore, I had access to the Singapore AL lounges which, as expected, were very good indeed.

The reason I chose Air India was simply price.  Singapore AL and BA are charging an arm and a leg at the moment for the direct flights to Singapore, whereas Air India was less than half as expensive.  Would I do it again?  If they had 787s on both legs, I might.  But not with the A320s on the Singapore leg.  Just too basic."

The lady next to me asked for a blanket at the beginning of the flight and eventually got one half way through the journey.  Other passengers  complained that there were no headphones provided.

I hope this might be of use to anyone who's going to or is thinking about booking with Air India.

My girlfriend and I are currently enjoying a very lazy afternoon on Agonda Beach having landed in Goa last Friday morning. We flew from London Heathrow to Goa and it was a flight I was pretty nervous about. Not because me or my girlfriend are nervous flyers but more so about the reviews we had read online about Air India. Beaten up old planes, no in flight entertainment, bad food and rude staff. All the sort of things you don't want on a 8.5hr flight!

The flight left on time at 1300. Upon boarding the plane, I noticed that a few of the seats were a bit shabby, the odd bit of tape wrapped over the arm rests and the general appearance of the plane was a bit tired looking. We found our seats and to my instant surprise, the TV appeared to be working which instantly lifted my spirits, even though I had downloaded plenty of films to see me through the flight, should the TVs not work. Our TVs worked throughout with a good range of new films and TV shows. I must say, not all the TVs were working but having walked around thr plane, i would say the majority were working fine. The plane took off and shortly after, the cabin crew got to work handing out snacks and a good selection of drinks. The lady looking after us was excellent, very friendly and had a lovely, calming presence. An excellent example of this was shortly before takeoff, she noticed a young lad, maybe 14/15 years old sitting on his own. She asked if he was travelling with a parent or guardian and he said no. She explained to him and she would personally look after him and if there was anything he needed during the flight, he should let her know. Although this is standard practice for a flight attendant, she had about 100 or so other people to attend to but she popped in to check on him multiple times during the flight and made sure he was served dinner before anyone else. This brings me nicely onto the food which I have to say, is the best I've ever eaten on a flight. We chose the Veg option and was served 2 meals on the flight, both as delicious as each other. There was also tea and water offered throughout, again all by the lovely flight attended (I wish i got her name). It looked as though there were 3 or 4 attendents on the flight and the flight was full but even being under staffed, they seemed to be very much on top of everything..We landed in goa 20mins ahead of schedule and departed the plane without any issues.

So i guess the point of posting my experience is this. From my experience, don't let the reviews of Ir India put you off. Our flight was fine, no problems at all. My only piece of advice would be, make sure you download enough stuff to watch throughout your flight, just in case your TV doesn't work.

Now back to my kingfisher...."

Both ways we had the worst experiences regarding meals and baggage collection and transfer from aircraft to airport in Bangalore. Despite being in Business class, there was no decent meal available for people, who wanted to eat light and non spicy food. Seeing this, we booked a blend and one jain meal on our return flight. Shockingly, the blend food was spicy and had garlic in it and jain meal was also too spicy. The crew expressed inability to provide us any alternative, even such as fruits. The baggage in Bangalore could be collected by us after 45 minutes, despite having 'priority' tag on it. On reaching Delhi Airport on 8th November, it was worst. The flight attendant announced belt number-1 for baggage collection at the time of de-boarding. We waited for 30 minutes and then started searching from belt to belt and finally found our baggage for IA-507, was off loaded on belt number-5. Again after waiting for a long time, we were able to finally collect baggage. Both sides, the experience was terrible. Also that a lady seated on a seat ahead of us behaved in a very rowdy manner throughout the flight. Despite my telling the flight attendant, she did nothing about it. We were lucky that all seats were not occupied in the Business class, that day, therefore, we could change our seats on our own."

My flight AI 905 Dubai - Chennai was very comfortable in seat 2D.

Of course the plane was very old. The saftey announcements were antiquated. Entertainment systems were absent. And the seats had limited reclining.

But the ticket was cheaper by 40%! So I was happy to accept this shortcomings. And the plane was on time.

However, the seats were clean. The 2 lady flight attendants were very attentive and empathetic, not just to me, but to all passengers.

I had ordered a gluten free meal and they made sure I was comfortable with it.

They served and helped as if it was natural to them. On other airlines, the flight attendants mostly behave as if they are doing you a favor, that they are very busy and you are a burden, even in Business Class.

But these 2 ladies were a credit to Air India. I don't know their names but hopefully Air India will commend them too."

I flew alone from San Francisco to Delhi, Delhi to Kolkata and came back with my father-in-law, and I didn't face any problems. The seats were comfortable (mine didn't go straight up all the way, but it was better than it not reclining at all, like some people complained), entertainment was more than enough to keep myself engaged on the 16 hour long flights, although some remotes did not work and touch screens were not very responsive.  Also, the reading lights could only be turned on with the remotes, so that was a problem. But other than that, everything else went smoothly. Added bonus was, the food was great (non-veg Hindu meal). They even served Chicken Biryani (my favorite dish)!  And we were served three full meals in the two flights! I won't hesitate to fly with Air India in the future."

When I arrived at Mumbai, my suitcase never appeared. I logged this with their team and was told that there were several flights from Delhi to Mumbai later in the day, and it would 100% be on one of those flights. 
My next flight back to London was on the following day at 8am, so I really pushed for my case to be at Mumbai airport before then.
I made several phone calls throughout the day to check the status of my case, but made no progress and instead was shouted at and hung up on by a member of their team! At 10pm I was finally told that there are 3 flights left and it is 100% guaranteed to be on one of those flights ready for the morning. 
On Sunday morning I had still heard nothing from them, so I decided to head to the airport an hour or so earlier than planned to see what was going on. I was escorted around different sections of the airport for about an hour and a half before they gave up and told me when it arrives, they will send it on to London for me to pick up from the airport.
I checked into my next flight and made my way back to London without my case. 
It is now Wednesday 2nd November and they have only just got it on the way to London for it to arrive at 7pm tonight. I have queried if the case will be sent to my door as it was not my error, but again I have not heard back from them.

Of my entire travel history , the experience flying with Air India has been the worst so far. I never wanted to book with them in the first place but ended up booking , as it was the only airline with whom I could book a direct flight without any stopovers  as I was travelling solo with my baby. 
Travelling solo isn’t easy and to make it easy and comfortable, I made sure before hand that I called up the airlines to arrange for specific things. For example:  providing assistance with the baggage . The staff hired by them are the worst of all. Arrogant, inhuman, heartless creatures, worst of all they are super ugly. They looked at me struggling with the pram in one hand and pushing the trolley with the other , but none of them offered to help. The flight supervisor at the London airport was the worst of all. He knew about the issue as I raised my voice and stood my ground about the argument but, he just steered away from the conversation as expected because he was just dumb. There was another skinny guy who before I could say anything, went on to say that I shouldn’t be talking to the staff like that, without even trying to make an effort to know as to what I was going through. One thing is pretty clear that these guys working don’t seem to be literate and were hired out of boredom. They seriously lack empathy for the customers. 
I would advise anyone who’s travelling solo with a baby or in general as well, avoid travelling with such an airline . It’s a big NO."

Well, one of the main reasons has been that while landing and take off, i have no idea what the pilots do but my ear drums dont feel like exploding, unlike other Airlines where I dread last 15 mins of landing!  Also, landings with Air India are smooth unlike some other airlines where they land with a thud! How can we miss the free food the airlines offer! Total value for money. They mostly get bridges to walk from plan into the airport which is a lot more convenient than being carried in buses! My experience though goes beyond all this!

 This September of year 2022, I found one more reason to continue flying Air India - their hospitality and going that extra mile for a passenger, which is me! No! I dont fly business class and i am not their gold or silver member! On my flight AI560, delhi-hyd sector, Seat 20F, dated Sep 26, a day which also happened to be my first ""navratra"" the flight purser ensured i get ""navratra meal"" as my breakfast and i dont go hungry! Unfortunately, i didnt get her name. When the flight purser reached me, I requested for curd and fruits from the tray she was holding. She asked me why i wasn't eating and i told her its my navratras! She promptly told me that they got navratra meal on board and if i would like to have that ! I was surely hungry and accepted the offer. The thoughts that didnt leave my mind was that i got navratra meal on a fligh!!  I rattled the story million times to everyone i met in next 4 days.

Sep 29 i got on AI840, hyd-delhi sector, seat 30F, 8.40 pm flight,  to go home. Of course, i am fasting all 8 days. The airport or lounge had nothing i could really eat. And i wasnt hoping for anything anyways. It was dinner time and the flight pursers started serving dinner. The person serving our side was Shiva Choudhary. He offered me my tray and i picked curd and spoon again. He asked me why to to which i Responded saying i m fasting. He came back after 5 mins with a bowl of fruits for me saying ""i can have this"". 2 times in a row! I was surely overwhelmed and was full of gratitude towards the staff and the airlines! 

Btw, my experience of Air India has always been pleasant, especially when it comes to the staff - be it ground staff or flight staff! But these 2 times, i was surely delighted. Thx to the management, pilots, and staff! Keep it up!

Her VOLATILE actions were seriously not required. She screwed up my on-boarding experience. Self absorbed and ill-mannered woman!

FYI - Nobody was interested to film this lady. (especially not me). Not even men on board would be keen to film her! 

To air India team, please be vigilant about this woman. Her behaviour throughout flight of 8 hours was volatile and she showed attitude even while giving meals. Her seniors and Co-staff members were apologetic but she dared not apologise at all.
Again, be cautious of this woman SONIA M - this egoistic woman can literally BITE anyone!"

As soon as we went in we found there were snacks (Haldiram’s Kashmiri mixture and Karakare) kept on our seats.  At first we thought the people before us left at the seat, Then we were told it was for us.  We didn’t find any blankets on the seats and when  we asked for blankets, The air hostess just looked at me curtly And said I can give you one.  I thought she did not hear me clearly and I said “I’m asking for blankets for me and my son we both traveling together”. She replied annoyingly “I understood what you said but like I said I can give you only one”. I was a bit puzzled and I asked her why we both are traveling with both people for tickets it’s not like me and my 12 year old son are traveling on the same ticket then why can’t we have two blankets and she replied back we have a shortage of blankets.  She said let me look and she disappeared luckily since I was carrying blanket to me and my son views that and the address is never came back without blankets.  The passenger next to me so everything and he said let’s take this out again and when she passed by here asked for blanket and he said she said look we have a shortage of blanket we are not able to provide blankets for everybody so if you want I can give you one.  This point we were really livid with her blunt replay and she just shrugged off.  I had just gone to the restroom just before the flight started and I saw The bathroom floor was covered in water.  Totally unhygienic and I asked the steward can you please clean this up.  He said just give me a moment and he started causing some passenger scene they don’t bother to do do things in a clean way and so on and so forth and it was making me really embarrassed and knows and I just told him I’m sorry, I’m really sorry that you have to go through all these things. He said oh no it’s a part of my job but I wish passengers would be more careful and I agreed with him and Cell he was in the process of cleaning up when he got a phone call and he told me to wait for a minute until he finishes the phone call and then the phone call somebody from the front I guess and a air hostess was calling him inquiring about the blankets and he told her “yes we do have 200 blankets but we have been instructed only to provide hundred blankets and we have to use the next hundred blankets for the next flight”.  I return back to my seat and I told the passenger next to me what I had heard and again he said “let’s ask the air hostess”, Which we did and to our shock she replied “ Yes we do have 200 blankets but we have been instructed only to distribute  hundred blankets to the passengers on this flight”. I was shocked when I said “but these are basic necessities we have beat for them we expect a working TV and blankets”so she said “I understand but this is our instruction from the management and we have to follow it”.

Nobody I was just water or anything after we entered the flight I thought it was basically to see that they provide us something to drink even if it’s just a flight that takes up at 1 AM they should offer us at least something to drink which they didn’t and many passengers then started going towards the kitchen demanding tea/coffee/water/soda etc.  

The seat had bugs in it and I kept itching my whole body.  I even complained to the air hostess who said it might have come in when the door was opened for the passengers.  I came home and applied lots of cream but I am still not better.  

Everyone expected that when Tata took over Air India things would change.  But it’s a big sham.  Another request the ground staff that help people with wheel chair have a large badge on them which says “NO TIP”.  But they will not let you leave unless you give them something.  In fact I asked the guy who was helping me how come you take tips? He said Ma’am this you are giving out of happiness where are we asking for it?.  He outright demanded that I give him tip and stopped the wheel chair in the middle of the ramp before going into the plane.  I gave him 500 Rupees which he accepted reluctantly.  Well it was better than before when I was going from Delhi to Cochin when those guys cornered me and my son and I had to pay him 60$.  

Nobody should travel in Air India.  People deserve to be treated better."

Well, my aircraft  from London to Ahmedabad on the AI 172 could be called as one such horrible step like behavior from Air India. The aircraft was either old, badly maintained or both. Toilets were dirty, cupboards falling apart under the sink, majority of the screens not working,  bad food (but that's to be expected) etc. etc. Why would Air India send such a bad aircraft into comission.  Would an aircraft bound for Delhi or Mumbai or even Banglore for that matter have a similar ghastly state? I doubt it. Ahmedabad is like a step-child, despite being full, despite being financially viable....
What saved this flight from becoming the worst flight of ours were the 2 gentleman cabin crew who were extremely warm and generous.  And above all understood what we were going through. 

Why even after such a big group taking over Air India, do they not have the vision of not sending these kind of aircrafts. Wouldn't a person like me, get re-affirmed about  what everyone was telling us about Air India.! Instead of changing the conversation about its image, this flight was what everyone had told us to expect, but we didnt. Surprisingly, our flight from Ahmedabad to London was not like this. It was a good aircraft,  clean, nothing falling apart, great cabin crew, what went wrong with this one!!

We paid extra for our emergency exit seats.. and I feel we need a refund. Who is going to bell THAT cat???"

Even though my friends advised me against it , I purchased 2 tickets on AI 101 to JFK and was traveling with my daughter. I was totally perplexed the moment I entered the flight. The aircraft was a total dumpster and I’m sure it’s more than 2 decades old minimum. The seats felt like wooden planks and to our horror , there was no entertainment system at all…!!! We were forced to spend 14 hrs without any sort of entertainment. The crew came around thrice . For 2 meals and then during landing. I was hoping to see some changes after TATA took over , but now I’m convinced that Air India will never change and I will never choose AI again in my life ..!!!!"

Upon arriving in the business cabin, I was surprised to be greeted by name by the cabin service director. I was offered orange juice or water.  The cabin is dated and the seats, although lie flat,  are not of the comfort of the most modern business class seats today.
A very good quality amenity pack was distributed but  no menus.
After take off, the drinks service started - I selected Lanson Champagne . Pourings were generous and my glass was refilled when empty. 
The lunch service offered pan fried trout or chicken curry. A a white table cloth was laid. Starters were a chicken salad and a separate bowl of salad. . The starter and salad  came on a tray with the main course being served separately. I chose the chicken curry which was medium spiced with rice, Dahl, pickles and a poppadum. It was tasty but not of the quality one would expect for business class. Garlic bread was also offered. Desert was a toffee pie. Cheese was not offered.. I continued with champagne with lunch as the only white wine offered was not to my taste. Service was very attentive and friendly.
The IFE was frankly rubbish. About 2 hours before landing a second meal of 3 types of chicken was served. It was not to my taste.
It was a comfortable flight with attentive service. Sort out the IFE, the food and attend to the little details and it could be very good!"

The seat I had paid extra for didn’t even come with a working handset so I spent 9-10 hours without any source of entertainment except the window. The flight attendant was kind enough to try to reset the handsets but if you are paying extra for a seat, all these things should be checked in advance and the seats should be reallocated. The complimentary non-veg meals were served first but they were cold, no butter for the bread and looked like sloppy goo. I only ate the fruit out of them. I was jealous of all the people receiving normal meals and honestly thought I should have just gone for a regular seat. The window had a weird crack in the middle glass (see picture of cloud) which made me a bit anxious but I just ignored it and nothing went wrong so that was good. Cracked arm rests, broken USB Ports, just a really tired aircraft that needs a lot of cosmetic work and attention to maintenance."

This will be my 10th or 11th trip to India over the last few years.  I've come to dislike every aspect of Air India. 

Customer Service - Does not exist - After hours on hold they provide nothing to help ever.  

Check in and gate - Always disorganized and they come up with new rules that doesn't even make sense most of the time. I truly believe, the staff just make up stuff as they go and do whatever they feel like to make the traveler's life miserable. 

Flight Seats - most seats are broken or flat with no cushion at all. I end up with body ache for days after the flight.  

Air Host/Hostess - They are rude and are never of any help. Cannot find one, and when one does show up, they are not helpful at all. This has been true for  all my flights with Air India. I think they are finding a comfortable hidden place to sleep. who cares about the travelers.  Whenever we ask for anything, they act as if we are bothering them talk back in a condescending manner. 

In Flight Food - I stopped eating on board. It is tasteless  and horrible. I've had packaged frozen meals that are so much better than the crap they serve in flight. Mind you, after each meal, the tray will sit in your lap for over an hour. No sign of the Air service staff picking it up. 

In Flight Amenities - Disgusting restrooms is an understatement. Urine all over the floor is common, it stinks like the public restrooms in India. Reminds you of the slumps. The attendants don't give a dam and the place is filthy all the time.  The customers are the down market people who travel like it's the public transport in India (Ghaties). These people sleep on the floor of the flight and the attendants say nothing!  No regard for other travelers. It is absolutely embarrassing, to have people travel this way.  

All my flights were absolutely horrible and will never fly Air India again.  Typically, I've taken Air India for the direct flight from US to India. With these unsightly experiences, I'm better off with layovers and flying any other airlines but Air India. 

Only advise for all travelers, AVOID Air India at all costs!

Hope this review helps others.

Our flight from Pune - Delhi was good but the ordeal begins at the New Delhi International Airport starting from Immigration check.

After boarding the plane - Staff was rude. Even rude is a nice word for them. Cleanliness was almost negligible.

To avoid the same exp., had to cancel my return flight from Frankfurt to Pune. When asked for a refund, they cut almost 70% of the fare by giving some cheap trick excuse as - my ticket was discounted price ticket and if i cancel the partial ticket, they will charge me regular fare.

When I asked them, where did they mention - 
1) What is the regular fare?
2) What is the discount %age that I got (as they claimed)?

They don't have any answer.

They don't even have clear terms for cancellation and Refunds. Imagine, being deducted 70% of your ticket price all by giving some cheap trick excuse.

1. Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight.
2. The seat as per the allotted was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly.
3. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.
4. When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence)
5. There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat)
6. International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask,   dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.
7. The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.
8. The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.
9. Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than  Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 
10. The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened.
11. The map was continuous  on “Flight Data not available” 
12. LUNCH- It was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.
13. After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.
14. After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. 
15. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.
16. The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.
17. The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.
18. The hot tea/coffee was served in paper cups of roadside quality which can be bought in market for Rs 25- 100 pieces. “Horrible standards” and shame for the purchase team and approving authorities of Air India.
19. We were ashamed of ourselves by booking Thru our national airlines but later realized the airlines has been taken over by some private owners. AND considering private ownership and muscat of MAHARAJA, we thought that days of 60s must have been back but oooooof!
20. Moreover the rates are almost equal as of other operators and at times more, hence there is no brilliancy in choosing Air India as option or economical substitute to others.
21. I alert all flyers to be prepared for similar experience after paying huge amount to these *Businessman*
22. Please never, never fly with Air India."

Like XL seats charged extra in other airlines. The seats were comfortable with clean fabric seat covers instead of the raxine we are now used to. Fabric was definitely more soothing. There were three washrooms at the rear instead of the usual 2 and were clean and functional. No long queues there. Take off and landing were both smooth. But the best part was the service given by the air stewards. All of them 5-6 I encountered in the two legs were very efficient, polite, smart and caring and were happy to meet any extra needs without any signs of irritation.

Of course it was the phone support people who told them they had to go to an office in the first place. I finally received an email saying that they would provide a refund (about $100 less than what they charged me) in 7-10 days. After 2 weeks, I emailed them back, politely asking them to look into it. They replied as if they knew NOTHING of the entire issue, asking again for all the original documents! I have been trying to log onto my Flying Returns account for months - impossible. They keep directing me to call them, which I did today. The representative told me I would have to send an email with a screen shot of the error to flyingreturn.base@airindia.com in order to get help. Unbelievable. Their airplanes are filthy, the technology (screens at the seats, audio, etc) don't work - the ONLY reason I fly Air India is because they are the only airline that flies direct from San Francisco to Delhi. I pray that Tata does something to improve their service."

I had to pay excess and rush through security, thankfully they were accommodating. When I reached my gate, everyone was still there, the flight hadn’t even arrived yet. In two other instances in 2021, the staffs at the ticket counter were so rude and talked as if I owed them something. People  like me that are very nervous and anxious get horrible jitters even if we’ve been travelling for years. There was no consideration except some female staffs who were very helpful. This is a plea to Air India, please moderate your staff and train them proper. I have on the other hand almost never experienced this kind of attitude from the staffs on flight. Why is there such a vast difference between them? Also I am the type of person to just suffer in silence because I know they are humans and will make mistakes but it’s been the 3rd time I’ve experienced such things, I would like to experience  a smooth check in process for once.

I was travelling from Kolkata to Uk first time with a toddler and was standing in children's check-in queue for 1.5 hrs. Not sure what the helpdesk did with the two families in front of me. When my turn came, I got to hear that check in has closed. Out of sheer helplessness, I pleaded the woman in the helpdesk to issue our boarding pass, only to be shouted back stating that she has only two hands and she has been continuously working and now the system will not allow her to issue the boarding pass. After lot of begging and convincing her manager, one boarding pass was issued and I could board the flight from Kolkata to Delhi during the final call 
I got myself seated with the toddler on the lap, only to get a surprise which probably Air India can only provide. Another person got the boarding pass with same seat number. The cabin crew took him to God knows where. In this context, let me tell you that I tried to do the check-in the day before but the Air India site crashed after charging me money. I heard later that this is a common experience with many other passengers of Air India 
After reaching Delhi, I walked all the way through the Airport along with the toddler and luggage to reach Air India helpdesk. There I was kept waiting for 1.5 hrs as the people in the helpdesk were trying to decipher the exact situation and the probable solution. After charging me an extra 15000 for no show of my child's boarding pass from Kolkata, they issued me a boarding pass along with the bassinet seat pass. On boarding the flight, I realised that bassinet seat was occupied, as it is provided on first come first serve basis. I requested one of my co-passengers to vacate the seat next to me and take up another seat, which he kindly did and I got my baby seated next to me.
No food was provided for the child although she had a separate ticket and an additional extra cost was paid in Delhi helpdesk."

I tried to check in online from vijayawada to sydney flight but
couldn't choose any seats. I then called the airlines for help. An
agent from Indian Airlines (Shweta Pandita) happen to cancel
my connecting flight from Delhi to Sydney. I was not informed or
notified by phone Or email. The only reason I found out was
when I tried checking in for the flight and I couldn't see my
connecting flight. I spoke to several different airline agents over
the phone for hours on the 3rd of Aug( a day before my actual
flight). No one were able to assist me. I went through a lot of
stress specially when I was travelling with a toddler and not
getting any help with any authorities. 

I was given a SORRY and changed the date of the flight. That did not stop there, I was constantly harrased by the group staff for carrying a bit over weight hand luggage as I had to carry a lot of stuff for my 13 hr flight for my toddler. 

Flight was smelling bad and food was horrible.

She filed the missing bag report with the Air India and they gave a file number.  Since then we have been trying to track the bags but there is no change in status. Air India customer service at  800 number was not useful,. They provided  general info about filing the report and aked me to call  the Delhi airport number. After several attempts I managed to talk to someone. He mentioned that they are still trying to locate the bag. I also called United airlines as they were the first carriers of the luggage. Their rep mentioned that bag was last scanned at Chicago. As per the process the bag was delivered to the Air India transfer location in Chicago and there is no trace or scan after that. Possibly it was never loaded to the Air India flight to DEL.  I mentioned this to Air India person asking that he contact their Chicago location to check it there. He said he will inform us when they locate the bag.  So far there is no response. Don't know what to do next.

- no effort to book me on any other carrier
- a planned trip is really  something they messed up

now my theory of why they do it
- gas prices high
- they cant get full capacity
- they cancel and indirectly have passenegers merge flights to get a full flight

takeaway
- never again fly air india at any rate

Passenger used wheelchair because of her knee trouble she was also wearing heavy braces but at two point wheel chair guy asked for money one guy even stopped her from boarding and said give money first. First guy dropped her to the boarding gate and asked for money second guy who was suppose to drop from boarding gate to flight stopped in between and asked for money that too if amount is less they wont accept.

Passenger booked 18 K Seat( paid extra for this seat) because of her condition she requested if its possible to get front seat because she got knee problem and she was wearing heavy braces but instead she was given same type seat that to at the back seat 50 then she complaint why you give me this seat 18K seat was same type for which she paid extra. They rejected her request and said we gave your seat to some one else and then gave her another same type of seat 40. No staff helped her she repeatedly told staff that her luggage is at seat 50 but they didn't cared and at one point they were rude to her but  thanks to passengers who helped her with her luggage . Don't change or give different  seat to passenger if you don't have just tell them on face we will see how it work we will inform flying staff instead of saying go go we only have this.

Air India operates like Haryana Roadways they will drop food and after that they wont care same behaviour when this  airline was under government hand and if they continue this way they will face same fate like Jet Airways.

Chicago Airport experience was outstanding wheel chair assistant helped her with everything and even called her family and said she will come soon because it was taking time  at this point family  was very impressed and assistant never asked for money but family did gave tips happily.

In short rude behaviour of staff and when you address this issue online they don't care at all.

It was cheap but a horror.  Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there...) 
If you book a hotel and organise a transit visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. Then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without a boarding pass.  Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque.

No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray.  Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom.

Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian warzone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping the embargo.  French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between.   So you pay a moral price too."

The customer service given in flight was horrible, the attendants were so rude. Only one of them were nice. The immigration check and luggage checkout was very slow. The line looked short but it took at least one hour for each. The cabin was not bad, only because I brought my own pillows. The food wasn’t the best, but good enough to eat. There was nothing really good at all, but the worst part of my experience was the flight attendant that just didn’t help us properly. Baggage claim was not bas, as we collected everything quicker than expected."

Travelled in May from Australia to India , that time too flight was delayed by more than 5 hours -

Delays are regular and on time flights - very rare (should learn from Indigo)
Dusty seats.
Dirty food trays.
Broken buttons on Entertainment screen, remotes.

Half the entertainment screens in the flight not working .

Even after paying bomb of prices- what we get at the end of it is very poor facilities.

Even Air Asia has better facilities for fraction of prices.

I think Air India is taking Indians looking for direct flight catering to mostly families and senior citizens FOR GRANTED."

My parents lodge a complain at Air India after arriving at Heathrow and given a receipt of a complaint. Air India staff asked to enquire in a couple of weeks time on the customer service numbers written on receipt and said it will then reach to the address in London with us.

After couple of weeks we couldn't get through their customer service numbers!
We managed to check at Ahmedabad Airport and they confirmed one bag didn't get on flight and is lying on Ahmedabad airport itself. After few days we got confirmation from Ahmedabad airport that they have sent the bag in another flight and has been arrived at Heathrow after 21 days. 

However, the customer service numbers at Heathrow/Air India (in UK) are left unmonitored so we cannot go through anyone at Air India in London. The customer service number  020 7760 3290  always rings and no one answers ever and another customer service mobile number 078 2594 0060 also rings and goes to voice mail which is full so no one can leave any voicemail. So basically they not being monitored! Now these are the numbers given to my parents in the receipt of a missing luggage! This shows how incompetent their customer service across the world is. We don't know how else to contact them and thinking to go to the airport in person now to get the luggage! 

I believe that's what Air India wants from their customers as they don't have resources (or the resources are incompetent) to fulfill basic requirements after we spent huge amount of money for flying. Worst customer service by airline."

1. No lounge for business class passengers
2. Rude check in staff - took 40 minutes to check in a handful of business class passengers
3. Flight started to taxi and then returned to gate due to technical snag - eventually was cancelled after passengers kept on board for over 4 hours
4. Passengers taken to hotel after midnight and told to wait for further announcement
5. No news from Air India in morning - I called their call centre and was told 'flight has flown'!!!!
6. Eventually found out at about 10 AM PAris time from contacts in Mumbai that flight would take off on 3rd June at 1645 - this was also put up on the Paris airport online departures but AIR INDIA gave no information!! 
7. At about 1330 Paris time on 3 June passengers got information to go to airport
8. Even though check in sign at airport counter was open, rude counter staff asked passengers to move away
9. Eventually passengers checked in and went to gate - and found no aircraft,no staff and no announcements
10. Gate was changed twice but still no announcements or staff
11. Eventually this flight took off after 2000 Paris time on 3rd June

My parents were scheduled to travel to USA and unfortunately my father contracted covid 4 days before travel. We requested for rescheduling the travel dates and what a torture it has been to get this simple thing done. 4 days , 10s of calls , multiple emails, 2 visits to delhi airport air india office to JUST reschedule the flight. Wow!! If we have an award for inefficiency and incompetency Air India deserves it hands down. From customer service to their employee and delhi airport office employees to their systems to their policy everything deserve a standing ovation for making sure even simple tasks like rescheduling flights are torturous ride for customers.
 Sincere note to everyone : Choose Air india at your own risk, system is so outdated and inefficient,  employees so indifferent and insensitive to your problem that sometime it feels like they are being paid extra for troubling customers. As I write my parents flight are yet to be rescheduled and i am forced to write this review.  Pledge to myself - Air india is not even going to last choice going forward.

I had to change my flight (which they wouldn't let me do online or on call, someone had to be sent to their offices in Delhi) and was downgraded from Business to Economy. I was told I can apply for a refund on the upgrade but when I tried, they always say we'll get back to you and no one ever does. I've been writing to them consistently for over 3 months. The call centre is hopeless and no one has a clue whats going on. On email all I get are automated replies and every time I follow up a new query is created and the context of the case is lost.

I thought if at all anything food will be great given the new owner's hospitality experience and the place of origin this time. Check-in, and flight attendants gave extremely good service  pleasant,  polite and helpful. I had requested for indian vegetarian meal. Breakfast and lunch were bad and the rotis were hard. I didn't even bother to take the third meal. I expressed my disappointment but the crew offered Western vegetarian at which point I couldn't eat any more.  They blamed it on thr caterers in Melbourne buy I have flown Singapore Airlines,  Qantas and Cathay pacific from Melbourne and Sydney to various international destinations in economy, premium economy and business and I have enjoyed excellent Indian vegetarian meals on all those three Airlines which are not owned by an Indian.  What was shocking was the fact I have had great food in their Shanghai to chennai flight on 2017 under the government ownership. This is not acceptable.

They told me to go down stairs and get direct flight to Australia instead and the cost was about $3000 extra for a flight which would have been in two days time .
I waited in the queue at the ticket booking office for a long time and a rude lady was in the office serving , as I was talking to her she got her handbag and other personal items out out from under the counter and just walked out as I was speaking to her , it appears it was the end of her shift and she was going home , I lost the money that I paid for my 3 tickets and the staff were abrupt and unpleasant .

Generally do not have too many expectations from the cabin service, and none from the ground staff. Flew AI-173 Delhi to San Francisco non stop 16 hours, Economy. Entertainment system did not work the entire flight! The hand control panel had buttons missing, couldn't switch on the reading light or use the call button. No pillows or blankets. Cabin crew made a total of 3 service visits the entire duration to serve food twice and beverages once. Were rarely seen at any other time. The flight itself was excellent as are most Air India flights. The service and crew experience was, however, a new low that was unexpected after the TATA takeover. Can't blame it on COVID; the return flight AI-102 from New York was excellent on all parameters (even though the aircraft had broken seat panels!)"

It’s such a poor representation of India and it’s embarrassing as an Indian to see my country be represented in such a poor manner internationally. The customer service is ridiculous. They are rude and treat their customers so degradingly. The seats were torn, and so old and uncomfortable. They didn’t even provide us with pillows and blankets, even after we asked for it. Since it’s a 12 hour flight, there’s nothing much to do except utilise the seat screen to watch movies or listen to songs. Half of those screens weren’t working, and when I told them it wasn’t working, she replied with “there’s nothing I can do about that, you just have to travel without it”. I then said “it’s a 12 hour flight, what do i do for the 12 hours?” and she just walked away. They were rude in providing the meals as well. The charging ports don’t work and the flight is very small and barely has any room to walk with bags when you’re getting on or off the flight. The staff are very arrogant and do not want to help. They were sleeping in the seats when people were turning their lights on to call them. Don’t travel with them - a flight cannot be worse than this flight is."

WORST of all though, I left a computer on the plane so I went to the service desk to retrieve it. I got to the desk a little before 5pm local time and told them what happened. 90 minutes later they tell me they found it and have it there with them but WONT give it to me because its no longer between 9 and 5. My flight out of Delhi was leaving that night at 2am so I couldn't stay until 9am the next morning. I asked them to mail it and they said no and still refused to give it to me even though they had it there. Then they just shut the window and walked away. I tried calling Air India once I was back in the states and their customer service told me that I had to call their Delhi customer service desk as they couldn't help me (This was the same desk who kept my computer and refused to give it to me because it was after 5pm). I haven't been able to get a hold of anyone to help me and I still don't have my computer even though I know exactly where it is. 
THEN on the flight back to the USA, we had to go through a second round of security checks but the conveyor belt wasn't working so they made us all stand around for an hour while they figured out how to plug it into a generator. They were super rude and not helpful at all and the flight was delayed because of it. Flight attendants were rude and not helpful and we got yelled at every time we wanted to open the curtain to look out the window. And AGAIN, the screens didn't work and there was no wifi so there was NOTHING to do for the 15hr flight. Miserable experience and will NOT travel with them again."

But they refused to Check-in Baggage till SFO and did for DEL- While checking at DEL-Airport - they say they should have  checked Baggage till SFO.
I have to claim Baggae at DEL and then wait for Flight to Open till 8 am. I can not use Lounge.  They Issue me Airindia Lounge Pass- But it was Waste as Lounge was closed - so think why they issue when the lounge is closed.

Also they were not helpful to checking my luggage for 8 hours. I have no choice and have to carry with me for 8 hours. I can not use any Lounge due to my checkin luggage. 

This was a totall harrassement from Air-India.

Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. 
Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that.
Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only.

Booked a ticket on line - payment charged on my credit card - AI screen continued showing ""Processing ......  Wait "" for almost 30 minutes and at the end message was Process Failed  - book again !!!!

Tried to communicate online Chat with Maharaja - there are Automated Q and NO WAY to get any response.
 
Called  customer service number - initial reply was We cant do any thing.
After a few calls a lady suggested I should call Ticketing Dept - have to call again same number - they cant transfer - so already an hour and half lost being in Q and trying to get a solution.

When I called the ticketing department - the gentleman on line was nice - but had NO WAY TO RESOLVE or address the issue - his message was I have to wait for 24 hours and wait - otherwise Follow Up for Refund and Book Fresh Ticket !!!!!!!!!
So my Money Taken - almost 2 and Half hour Lost and may have to book at much higher rate tomorrow and May be waste FEW more HOURS for refund of about Rupees 6000 !!!!!

MOST UNPROFESSIONAL Approach - I feel this is  TOTALLY AGAINST BASICS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!!!!

I suggested that when I can provide the seat number blocked , Flight details , date, Passenger name , etc and message from Bank showing Payment Processed - they should block the seat and find a solution - and for any reason there is a fault from even Bank - I can reprocess the payments - but AIR INDIA cant do anything !!

So customer suffer , waste time , continue follow ups for Payments taken away and so on - Customer Service has NO SERVICE to provide .

Hope some sensible person in new management will look at Basic Services and Customer convenience and Fare Business Practices.

I will have to let go my money as Donation, may be for revival of the Airlines or Slog to get ticket or Refund.

Another issue - and have no back up for the same - The ticket value showed at Rs. 5200. In 3 minutes , by the time details were filled up - Rs 6194 was charged - and seems that is also gone !!!

Worst service ever. Today my flight from DL to CCU at 6.50AM. They don’t allow me to board the flight from gate No. 30 (T3-IGI). I was there at 6.30, but they told me they can’t allow me along with other four passengers due to delay with one minute, if you reach by 6.29 AM, we will allow and no alternative flight was provided by them. I tried my all efforts to request them to board as our official meeting has been fixed, but the team was not bother to listen a word. Just for a single minute.

Not recommending this airline ever. The guy who was there I guess their manager or In charge was very rude to customers. The flight was in front of our eyes and flew at 7.00AM. we request almost half an hour to make him agree about the checking protocols and jam-packed at the airport. Very Bad behaviour from senior staff, even she didn’t respond properly (Ms. Reena).

They even didn’t call us for final call and the screen was still showing final call. (I have the photos and video along with their staff who were not ready to listen and ignore us like no one is there.)
#airindia :- You don’t have proper notifications window or any type announcement form airline. Better option take indigo, vistara etc.

Don’t know how this airline ever succeeded. The worst airline in the history of all airlines. Really gives India a horrible name. Customer service of this airline company is next to absurd and despicable. People like them who were their (customer services executives) who claim to help their customers don’t deserve to have such jobs. This airline company needs to close down. With the way they handle things especially during a pandemic, wouldn’t be too surprised to see karma return soon to this airline company. Air India should shut down it’s company and send all their employees to the US or any big country to learn how to deal with customers and actually display the meaning of customer service. Sad to even associate our beautiful country of India to such a horrible airline company.

Honestly the worst service I've experienced, hopefully they'll respond here so I can get my money back as this feels like a full on scam."

I had the immense misfortune of travelling Air India this month. I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. 
 When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager, Gina Patel. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. Gina Patel who is supposed to be a “supervisor” came and without a greeting or an apology states “ you have 2 options –you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.” When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “ then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. 
I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united –unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. 
I explained my situation to the united manager Ms. Dhillon, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that Gina Patel had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager Ms. Linda Chintha out of her office. Lydia or Linda Chintha (cant recall the name) now stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional i.e broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time Ms Gina Patel reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “ I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor Dheeraj Kain and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C. These passengers also made a complaint to Ms Chintha about Ms Patels behavior. Anyway it so turned out that Ms Chintha had also lied and the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were completlely broken during take off and landing. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery. 
My questions to Air India who I hold ultimately responsible 
1.	Why was my assigned seat not honoured? If the seats are broken it is the airlines responsibility to either fix them prior to selling the seat or to not continue selling seats. 
2.	I have never had an airline dump their responsibility by inconveniencing the customer – if the airline cannot accommodate they normally either compensate a passenger or upgrade the passenger but to leave a passenger standing holding a ticket and no support is completely irresponsible 
3.	Why is someone like Gina Patel allowed interacting with passengers (I was informed by the flight staff that she has been known to have a bad attitude and gets into conflicts with passengers and staff on a routine basis)? 
4.	Why and how can an airline keep staff that are dishonest (Gina telling me that she is the boss when clearly there was a manager in house and Ms. Chintha telling me that the seat was manually functional when clearly it was broken)
5.	Does the airline and their staff believes that a mileage ticket is a free ticket – it is not!  Just like money miles are earned and once used to buy a ticket needs to be honored and treated the same. I am sure a lawyer would agree
6.	Finally I would like to know how Air India expects to resolve the mess that was created by their lack of aircraft maintenance, rude and incompetent staff and complete disregard of FAA rules in terms of safety"

When my father explained that there were no weight restrictions on handbags on his previous connecting airlines, Manish replied that they do not care for any other airlines tickets except Air India.

I was travelling with a 3.5 months old baby and did full planning to ensure I didn't face any trouble. I booked bassinet seat, carried my stroller, was carrying all the required baby items ( diapers, wipes, feeding bottles, formula bottles, blanket, spare dress etc) to reduce any dependency on flight staff. But still had a very underwhelming experience to say the least.
To begin with, right after I boared my flight I noticed the seat I assigned was broken. There was no tray table, even the remote was not working. When I asked for change of seat, flight staff said they had full flight and the only other option was the crew seats at the very end of the plane. Not only did the seats have no bassinet option, they were also in a dilapidated state. There were sharp edges coming out from the side of the seat and the tray slab kept falling off throughout the flight. But the staff didn't care at all about this & just told me to manage as it was the best they could offer. And the worst was air India staff's attitude. Even after signalling the staff, they would not come to my seat and I had to wait for them to cross my aisle to stop them and request to watch my baby, if I needed to use the restroom. And after a point I got so fed up that I stopped asking them and decided to use the restroom after getting off the flight. The extent of inhumane nature was that I was forced to pick up the trash diapers with my baby in one hand and dispose. They plainly denied disposing off the diapers. I have learnt my lesson to not take an AI flight ever again but also want you to learn from my experience that Air India is not at all reliable, especially if you are travelling alone with your baby."

Met with an accident followed by the breakdown of the vehicle on the way to airport. Informed the airport staff this is what happened. They asked as to arrive at the earliest at least before 30 min for the domestic connection flight. Flight time was 20:10 from kochi and I have reached the airport at 07:35hrs. But they didn’t allow me to pass through. I requested them to allow me without baggage. They didn’t allow me instead on of the crew on the baggage was laughing at me. Other came in and voiced the you can’t go. Go to the office and change your flight time to tomorrow. Been there requested that I want to go, it’s an emergency as they could have let me in without baggage. But they didn’t. I was upset and they said I have pay 15750 and rebook ticket for tomorrow if I want to go. They were saying about airport rules and they can’t allow You have no idea how traumatic it was.

I reached the airport on time as they asked for and now that declared as late arrival. I sat at their office from 7:35 to 8:30pm for them to rebook my ticket? They know that I was there it wasn’t my fault. I understand boarding closes only before 20 minutes and I came at 07:35. They didn’t even allow me without baggage which you could have for domestic flight. This   is inhumane and ridiculous. I tried online check in didn’t work and ranged airport staff couple of times.

I traveled to Germany on 9th February 2022 with my 3 year old kid and Wife, and this Air India ( Bangalore) staff named Mr.Keila Narayanroa turned out to be a nightmare for us. 

These people are being trained specially to target family goers with small kids and extract money in the name of excess baggage, as they fly empty, so this is the only money making avenue. 

Their modus operandi is very simple, on their website its says that a single luggage of 32 KGS to the max will be allowed but when you reach the airport they totally refrain from it and says the total luggage of only 23 KGS will be allowed. Thus starts the packing and unpacking and poor passengers are being harassed to the core.

Now comes the negotiation and they charge Rs:500 for every extra kilos. Just do the maths and you will understand their money making strategy.

Avoid this airline at every cost."

You may be better not to use it and go about 30 min before as I ended up getting a middle seat though I wanted to pay for my aisle seat. Ended up travelling 16 hrs flight in the middle seat.
2. Only 10% of the TV screens works. USB drives dont work for charging your phones in such a long flight
3. The staff provide some basic service. You may ask for a blanket, some form or some other help - most of them have standard protocol of saying that they will come back later and then they just ignore. 
4. Toilets maintenance is not very good. However it has slightly improved in the last 2 years. Back in 2018 & 2019, it was horrible. At least most of the toilets work.
5. Meals serving sizes have gone down. It is probably 75% what was a year ago. 2 meals and one snack bag may be ok if you are not very hungry for this 15 ~ 17 hour flight. 
6. If you travel 5 times, at least once you may have your baggage lost. We once went for a marriage. We got most of our bags just one day before our return flight
7. Airport check in & baggage drop is a big ordeal. You may want to literally come 3 hours before to compensate the inefficient process and lack of staff. May be two or three counters are staffed typically for a 777 or 747 load of people  "

At first they cranked up the AC to be soo cold that everyone on the flight put on their jackets and we dressed our baby to stay warm and she fell asleep. 1 hour later they made the flight soo hot that people were taking off all their layers and still sweating. Our baby also got soo warm that she woke up crying. An hour to 2 hours later they again made the flight super cold. This cycle of super hot to super cold continued the entire flight in 2 hour intervals. 
Our flight departure was at 10:30am, they served us lunch at around 2pm, which is fine. After that we did not see any of the flight attendants to give passengers any tea/coffee/snacks/water/wine till 11pm!! Everyone was so hungry, they finally came around with diner at 11pm. And soon after dinner, at 11:30pm they started distributing snack bags with chips, biscuits, cookies, etc. I mean what is wrong with these people?!
We had booked a bassinet seat and baby meal for the baby. Luckily we got a bassinet, but it was filled with the remanence of Indian snacks from whoever used it previously, and the flight attendant who was installing it even saw it and didn't do anything about it. Just left all the food waste in the bassinet. We didn't even bother saying anything. When we asked for the baby food, they said they didn't have any, luckily we packed enough food for her to have for the duration of the flight.
And of course, the entertainment screens did not work, the content itself was abysmal, and the picture quality was from the 70s.

During the flight also been treated badly, they do not have staff who can handle full flight of passengers, did not have headset for tv, food was not provided as per selected option. Then in Delhi airport I had a connecting flight in which they kept on changing gate , people are tired they are jet lagged they want to relax for the middle time , but it’s a blame game they played we r suppose to give handbags to check-in because there aircraft does not have enough space , then why give 1 bag allowance in first place??? And certain passengers who reach early get to keep 3 bags it’s like first come first serve  , on top of it felt like they wanted to waste time coz they had technical issues and flight was again delayed by an hour.

- Arrogant 
- Rude 
- Not in the frame of mind to accept the fault
- Unacceptable response when complaint was informed.

Time - 6:30 am - 17th Jan 2021
-----------------------------------------------
With just 4 counters operating and 1 counter getting shut in a matter of 10-12 mins from 6:50 am. The cue at the counter had only 3 people in front of me. 

Seeing the busy gentlemen, I tried to switch to an other counter. Suddenly the Air India Male staff comes and says this counter is getting closed in a while and there is enough time for your flight. (UNACCEPTABLE RESPONSE BY GROUND STAFF).

The gentlemen at the check-in counter took almost 20-25 min to complete an ‘International Flight’ check-in and other domestic flight travellers including myself were just waiting.

Once my turn came to show the e-ticket at the check-in counter and complaining about the above. The gentlemen responds by saying ‘Thank You Sir’. Upon telling him how he is responding, he again responds back saying ‘Thank You Sir’.
Is this the way to handle a complaint.

Being from the hospitality industry it seems he had not been taught how to treat his customers and handle complaints.

Secondly, the inflight crew was amazing. One of the Male Crew on the flight. He was wearing a mask with a black band behind his head. 

He was was ‘Super’. (Apologies for not mentioning his name as I didn’t ask).

Following COVID safety I was not going to eat my inflight complimentary meal. He politely asked me twice if I wanted something.

During clearance of trays, he again came around asking if I wanted tea, something to eat or drink water.

Now this is CUSTOMER DELIGHT. I request the Air India team to offer him a ‘certificate of appreciation’

Hope the Air India training team looks in to the complaint seriously so that it never happens again with any other customer."

I was there at airport before 2.5 hours for my flight  (web check-in completed already) and I stood in the queue for long time. Less number of counters were open and by the time I reached the counter I had only 1 hour left as they were many breach in the queue by the airport  staffs themselves rearranging the people in the queue. At the counter, I was told that I need to have my passenger locator form filled to allow boarding. I agree it is my fault but I had no reminders even while I was standing in the queue. But I managed to get it done in 30mins. I was surrounded by 3- 4 Air India staffs threatening that I can't board the flight and doing all sort of things to not allow me to complete the form. Still I managed and it was available before 30mins. But the extremely rude counter staff just walked away saying that check-in closed and you can't board the flight. I paid 3 times the flight ticket for this travel and not allowed to board means I lost all my money without a refund. Finally I had to book a very expensive one way flight with another service due to last minute booking. I had spend a fortune for my return travel to London. All credit goes to extremely rude Air India Staff and no doubt why the  carrier went on loss and finally to be sold out to private. Never ever I travel with them again in future.

Other service  I booked was with Virgin Atlantic. Extremely friendly staff were checking with everyone in the queue about the documents and helping those had issues. Entire trip was so peaceful and I am happy with every bit of money I spent. It will be good for Tata to replace the Air India staff completely with well trained staff or else it will never be able to become successful with the kind of staff Air India have now. Needless to say about in flight service. Damaged monitors/headphones, Stinky carpets, no blankets, tasteless food."

I have had previous bad experiences with Air India, but I was expecting that things might have improved by now. First of all, the lady at the check in counter did have little manners. I wonder how Air India appoints these kind of employees and that too in Chicago. And then came the 20 year old flight 777 perhaps. None of their entertainment systems worked throughout the whole 14 hours flight that were in front of us. We requested if something could be done. But nothing probably could be done by the helpless airhostess. At least Air India should have checked things prior to departure as an item in the checklist. That is a minimum to have things like that fixed for such long hour flights. I hope they check things which are crucial to fly the aircraft safely. And another hope is that Air India uses some new aircrafts in such long routes so that customers can have some quality service.  Customers pay money for some basic services and you can't keep on saying this doesn't work and that doesn't work when you are at 36000ft. I will probably not take Air India in future unless I have to. But I really hope they take some steps to improve their service.   "

Most US airlines serve food only a couple of times, that too the vegetarian food is hardly any good - they sometimes just serve a banana for breakfast for Asian Veg meal.

Easy check in.
Good boarding protocols.
Very good cabin crew, very courteous and helpful.
Two meals with wide choices and our selections were very good.
Good de-planing protocols.
The downside of this trip was yet another example of how bad Heathrow is as an airport.  We arrived to Terminal 2 and the pilot had to wait 45 minutes for a parking bay.  Eventually arriving at the parking bay there is no operator for the airbridge.  Eventually an operator comes, messes around moving the airbridge here and there and then disappears. After some time we get a message via the cabin crew that the airbridges are apparently not operational and nobody seems to know what to do.  Moving the aircraft to another parking bay was probably not an option because the ground staff had already started unloading and servicing. Then we see some people coming and going on the airbridges and eventually one starts moving towards the aircraft and docks so that we were able to de-plane. This all took about an hour and a half.
We clear immigration and pick up our bags and head out. We had arranged with an airport car service to meet us on Level 4 of the car park.  We get to the elevators for the car park and find two very long queues.  Out of six elevators only two are working and none of the Heathrow ground staff seem to care at all.

I am giving this rating purely due to the ""I don't Care"" attitude from Air India. There is absolutely no response to email, Phone, Twitter even as a courtesy to acknowledge their mistake of losing by baggage for over 5 weeks now or letting me know that they are working on it but they simply work like any government office in India where their customers are under their mercy. 

I lost my Amazon Basics Black Color International size check in baggage while boarding a connecting flight from Delhi to Kolkata and according to the baggage handler they are still looking for it. I don't understand how long will it take for them to find it. I have lost many valuables costing in excess of $500 and more importantly they were gifts for my loved ones which I couldn't give them. 

Even after spending countless hours on the phone and email trying to get a hold of someone I am not getting anywhere with at least a response stating that someone is looking for it. I understand that mistakes do happen from every airline but it their response to the situation which wins or loses a customer. In Air India's case they have clearly lost me and my friends.

This is first time I travelled with AI in my last 10 years to and fro journey from India to Canada and I could not stop myself to write a review about what I experienced. This airline is the worst and their customer service is pathetic. My first flight was from Toronto, Canada to Delhi, India on Nov 26, 2021. On that day we had to wait inside the flight (onboard) for more than 8 hours due to technical issue. They did not even let us to cancel our flight, reschedule, exit or wait outside. It was pathetic to sit inside the plane for more than 8 hours before 16 hours journey from Toronto to Delhi. However, now when I need to reschedule my flight from for my journey back from Delhi to Toronto, nobody is picking up from ticketing customer service. I have been trying to call and reach them for last 2-3 days, they put me on hold for extra long period and the call automatically disconnects after 1 hour. My return flight is on Dec 26, I have less than 24 hours left which means I can not reschedule after trying my best! Also, when I log in online I can not reschedule my flight and I have been told it can only be done by AI agent. In short I will never ever travel with this airlines and I recommend not to travel."

"2021-12-06T20:53:31-05:00","3","review","0","Observations and recommendations to Air India to improve their international services.","Observations:

I will list each stage of the experience flying AI 188 (YYZ>DEL) business class as below:

1. Ease of booking: 
No problem except the Travel Agent could not insert your frequent flyer number (if outside of Air India) during ticket booking. Had to do so at the time of check in to ensure that the United frequent flyer was printed on the Boarding Pass.

Recommendation: 
Air India should ensure that any Star Alliance number can be inserted into the booking.

2. Check-In: Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results.
Recommendation: Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines;

3. Boarding: 
Delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. The business class seats did not recline to 180 degrees as advertised but reclined only up to 160 degrees giving the feeling that I was sliding down when asleep. In-flight entertainment did not have many options and selection of movies and TV Programs was very poor.

Recommendation: 
The reputation of Air India can be enhanced a lot if they learn to keep time!

4. Flight: 
Smooth flight, great Boeing 777 take off and landing and great meals! However, after the first 2 hours, the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not re-stocked;
Recommendation: 
For a 24 hour flight, it is important that the flight cabin crew maintains the hygiene standards and restocks the supplies!

5. Staff Courtesy: 
Extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew from start until the end of flight. Very helpful to the families with kids and the senior citizens as well.

6. Air India Lounge at Delhi airport: 
Very little supplies and hardly any variety of food. Cramped space during the pandemic.

Recommendation: 
Air India should learn from other Business Class lounges and upgrade their Lounge.

Note: I flew AI 868 from Delhi to Mumbai after the 14 hour flight from Toronto to Delhi. It was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by Air India non-flying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes. My own business class seat was changed in favor of a Captain's daughter flying on the flight.
Recommendation: Air India can do much better by not disturbing or bumping around paying passengers in favor of non-paying ones.

Delhi Airport: Crowd management can be improved a lot, especially during these pandemic times."

The whole journey was a series of unfortunate events. 
The first flight to DEL was delayed due to delayed take off. We landed late and I informed the staff twice that I had a connecting flight to make 2 hours after scheduled departure to which staff replied that I need not worry and that I would make it since that was an AI flight. Fast forward to a few hours later, I miss the connecting flight by a few minutes since the staff cannot make a call to the boarding gate that I am at security and will be there in a few minutes. (I have no check in baggage so it would have only taken me a few mins). 
They then mess up rescheduling me to the next flight by trying to get me on the next to next flight. After about 3 trips around the airport and a lot of begging, pleading and some firm retaliation, I am booked on the next flight. 
To no surprise, the next flight is also delayed. No staff shows up at the gate until 20 mins before new departure time. They then begin boarding but are unable to proceed with boarding as they cannot figure out how to open the gate and let passengers into the plane. Which is plain ridiculous. 
We finally begin boarding, way past the delayed departure time too. I write this while waiting to board, expecting many more hurdles on what was supposed to be a seamless trip home. 
I strongly recommend against flying AI!!"

I never bothered to mention how pathetic this airline is due to the fact that their company itself Is in financial soup and ready for bankruptcy. However, this trip on 14 November left me speechless and hugely disappointed.

Details in Nutshell:
1. Food Tray was broken and I have asked for a change of seat - Flight attendant's answer no seats available and I have to adjust with Food tray as he can't do anything until the flight reaches London. I have to use my own lap to eat the food

2. I have asked for Non-Veg, as I have already eaten Veg first time - Flight attendant answer - Sorry no options and Veg is the only option. My next seat customer has got the Non-Veg after some heated discussion, still o luck for me

3. Due to a delayed flight and uncomfortable seating (My seat recliner doesn't work) so I have to stay in the same position for 10 hours. Seat recliner push-button broken hence can not push back. Flight attendant response - Cant do anything, we will check and sort this in London. 

4. Forget about charging ports, as literally all the USB ports are broken and Flight inhouse media needs to reboot twice to work the Multimedia

5. THE WORST EXPERIENCE, I felt cold and wanted to sleep a little and request the airlines to provide me with a blanket as I have seen few customers were offered. Flight attendant - SORRY WE DONT HAVE ANY ENOUGH STOCK IN FLIGHT. I COULD NOT EVEN GET THE BLANKET FOR A 10 HOUR FLIGHT.

6. Toilet Flush broken - Flight attendant response- we will let this checked in London, currently do not use this toilet.

Inflight service was very poor, broken hand rest, dirty seat and there was some mess happened in one of the bathrooms which apparently was wiped with covid overall coat and laid there in front of my seat till the end of the flight. No one cared to clean it up. It was DISGUSTING.
On top of already a worst experience., I was missing all of my bags. Almost 70% passengers missing bags which is beyond my understanding. It was an absolute chaos at OHare international. Its been 48 hours and I haven’t heard from airlines any whereabouts my bags. 
I will NOT RECOMMEND flying Air India until they fix their management and inflight services.

Checked with the airline customer service on Covid requirements and they mention kids below 2 years not required to get Covid testing. A surprise was waiting when we reached on the day of flight. They denied birding since our 8 months old did not have the Covid testing done.
Now the second part started! We were very badly wanted to talk to customer service to reschedule the tickets. In all of 5 hours waiting with multiple dials, we could talk to 3 people and 2 of them just put us on hold saying they are transferring the call and the other was in no mood to help! Though he was very polite and pretended he is pulling the data, heard nothing useful from him and he abruptly end the call. We ended up on feedback post that and left my feedback. Did not hear anything after that. Still struggling to resolve the issue as no response to emails either.

They put my flight ticket open as they wernet refundable, with assurity that there wont be any penalty and just a FARE difference if flying same route, class. 
Now as soon as I heard the ban is lifting, I contacted them and they gave me quote of $500+ with $200 date change penalty. It took me 10 days to fight with them and show them about their assurity and I kept telling them, the flights will be booked if we keep waiting on this.
After 10 days they said, ok no penalty but flights are booked and per persons is $800 + fare difference.
The new ticket of Air India is $1000. I paid $1300 for per person earlier. So, what I understand:
1. Air India is running by pretty stupid people and tends to go in loss.
2. After such a below poor service in terms of everything and such higher and unreasonable cost, if they are still going in loss, it is not running by some incapable or corrupt management

2. Air India had two rows, F & G open for ALL the AI flights taking off during the 3 to 6 hours. 
3. Even then not all counters were open at F n G!
4. Passengers going to 6 7 diff Intl destinations were using two very long serpentine queues.
6. AI ground staff made things more chaotic by every now and then yelling out Chicago, Frankfurt, JFK, Heathrow etc.. by telling passengers going to such destinations, to jump queues and to go to particular counters.
This lead to passengers who were originally behind, to front at the new check-in counters. Often leading to upset passengers and frayed tempers.
7. I and many others had to wait and stand in the queue for nearly 3 hours. I checked in at about 2am, but not before another young passenger accused me of jumping queue!
8. After further waits at Immigration and Security checks and long walk to the end of terminal Gate, I was finally able to sit on a seat at about 3am, inside the plane."

My father called before I did and after one hour they ended his call automatically. He never spoke to anyone and was on hold the whole time.

Their wait time is odd too. I would be told my wait time is 30 minutes, and then it would switch to one hour after about 5 minutes. That makes no sense.

Flight was at 6:am from Dubai. Boarding was supposed to begin at 5:30am. As yiu can imagine with all Covid related procedures,  i got to the airport at 3:30am and at the gate around 4:30am. I could see quite a few people at the gate early. 

Everyone waited until 6:50am for the boarding ro behin. There was not a single announcement as a courtesy to passengers letting them know about the delay. No one knew what is going on. 

They did not weigh the cabin bag and hang luggage at the bag checking. But then they did at the gate and weighed even the hand luggage. They charged passengers 55AED per KG of extra and this even included the duty free shopping people had done. I see so many issues with this. Why couldn't they weigh the stuff at the check in so in case ita overweight, we could have moved some items in our check in luggage. How can they count duty free items in the weight and haven't mentioned thY in the website. Prwtty much a rip off scheme.

We booked an air India flight to Goa, but the flight was horrible so was the ground staff as well as the people sitting at the reception. 
There was an 11 month baby with us. At the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else. But they did not cooperate
The Air India website is so so poor. This is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in. I have traveled so many times before, each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasnt the case with this airline. Rather we got the last seat of the airline i.e., the seat near the washroom. It was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us

Again while coming back from GOA the same thing happened. The same seats were allotted.
I called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call.  After 25 mins. one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude. She said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that
I tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side.
While calling the Air India customer care even if u are in a queue, your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down.

The staff was highly rude and no cooperative and it was a terrible experience. The mother with the infant wasnt given any preference for the seat even after requesting them. 

It was one of the most terrible experience ever. I would suggest all of you to please refrain from booking any Air India flight especially for the domestic travel. Atleast I wont ever book an Air India flight ever."

Hand rest of seat was broken, Screen was not working for an entertainment.  Before departure of flight they left over snacks. the patty looks old stuffed.  I Asked Air hostess to please check the screen. She said in rude way, I DONT KNOW, IF IT DOEST WORK GO SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE. Pilot is so untrained while landing, it gave a heavy jerk. 
While returning flights got canceled due to covid. First my flight got rescheduled  and then later they canceled the flight and send me refund. Normally you guys don't give refund in a year and when it come to cancel the flight without consent you guys send me refund. It was just a cheap trick to book flight on heft cost. Which i did . I paid an another 30 grand extra. I spoke with customer care. He was stick on one statement I DONT KNOW ANYTHING, YOU CANCELED THE FILGHT. i told him that i am Canadian  citizen why should i cancel it. That was complete confirmed that a UKG fail was sitting on chair. SO you SO CALLED FAKE STAR ALLIACE, this flight is worst, useless, garbage. I released if you get cheap flight you will get cheap services. I must say i the CHINA AIRLINES were more better than this. My refund is still stuck from past 6 months, they didn't paid.

Pathetic customer service.","In July 2021, I was in India and changed the date of my outbound flight(New Delhi to London) by paying INR 12,915 to Air India. I didn't receive the new ticket even after 2 days so I called their customer service and was told that it will be done in 24 hours. After a few days, I emailed but nobody replied. They only send you generic emails which suggest you contact customer care. I emailed again a few times as their customer care number was busy but email address is  a farce as nobody responds. Their WhatsApp number doesn't work either. I made another call a day before flying but still no joy. Eventually, I sent them a last email warning them that I won't be able to fly if they don't send my ticket the same day but still no response.

After few days, I called their customer care on 01242641407 three times in a day. Please read the following:

1) In the morning, I talked to Bhavna who listened to my issue and transferred me to escalation team. After 20 mins of waiting the call automatically got dropped.

2) Around 3:30 pm I called again and talked to Shweta who was really concerned about the issue and told me that the ticket will be reissued as I didn't receive the last one. She requested me to stay on call and put me on hold. After 23 minutes the call got disconnected.

3) Around 4:00 pm I called again and talked to Aanchal who didn't seem much bothered about the whole issue. She heard the issue and transferred me to some department. I did ask her what department she was transferring me to but she was in a  hurry and just did it. I was on hold for 35 minutes and then I disconnected as I couldn't bear anymore.

Worst part is that all 3 customer reps knew that I was a distressed customer but nobody called back.

I paid for the ticket but never received it. Their customer care isn't bothered. I don't know why?

PS: I still await a response and a ticket."

I had my return flight from Kolkata to Chicago on 25th January 2021 connecting at Delhi. I had some less than ideal experiences while travelling with Air India. 

1. I was not contacted or notified anything regarding any documentation or requirements regarding COVID on behalf of the airline.

2. I called the Air India helpline one day before asking if I needed any specific document to board on flight due to new CDC guidelines for travelling to the US. The agent said I would not need any such document to board on flight due to COVID. I also asked if there is a problem if I board in Delhi instead of Kolkata. He said there is no problem if I board from Delhi. 

3. So, I went to the airport on the day. At the check-in counter I was asked for a COVID negative report taken within the last 72 hours or produced documentation that I had recovered from COVID within the last 90 days. They also notified me at the same time that since my boarding was from Kolkata and I did not board from there I need to pay a penalty of Rs 27,250. 

4. So I went to the ticket counter and paid the penalty. Then I called up the COVID testing agency Nebraska Test and requested them to send me the documentation which I showed at the counter. They still denied me boarding asking that I still need to produce a negative report.

At one point at this time I wanted to record a video of what's happening around. But, one of the agents came forward and told me I could not do so.

5. Then after an hour or so I went back to ask another Air India agent if there is anything I can do to board the flight. She checked my documentation and asked to get an antigen test from a station outside of the airport one hour prior to the departure. I went there to find out that I can not take the test as it was reserved at that time for the passenger of a specific airline. So, finally I could not board. Neither the airline relationship manager, nor duty officer, nor operations manager will even speak to me properly and had been very rude throughout. I requested them to send me an email notifying me why I was denied. But, they refused to do so.

** Regarding the COVID test, one of the junior Air India employees while ushering me to the testing station out of the airport building, told me that I could have gotten away without the COVID test in hand if I had bribed any junior employer. They would have managed (""jugaad"") the issue. Couple of other friendly people also mentioned that everybody gets a negative report there and asked me not to worry.

6. I had been emailing and calling their helpline to reach and seek information during these hours. But, even after more than 6 months had passed they did not email me back to address this issue. The agents on the phone would sometimes hang up, stop talking suddenly, or promise that someone will call back shortly which they never did.

6. Then after that flight departed I went to the ticket counter to ask what other options do I have. The lady at the counter told me that I could board a flight at 1:45pm on 26th January with a penalty of Rs. 25,000. But I need to produce a COVID negative report by then. She assured me that I will get the flight and the amount of penalty won't change. So, I went outside again to get a COVID test.

7. When I got my report in the morning around 8 am the crew at the ticketing counter changed. I mentioned what another agent told me previously. But, she told me that I could get a flight earliest on 28th January and I need to pay a penalty of around Rs. 52,000. 

8. After some deliberation, I realized that I can not trust their word of mouth. So, I bought a new ticket with another airline and returned. I wanted to cancel the ticket since I was not flying with them anymore. The agent at the desk cancelled my ticket and then informed me that I need to contact the third party agency from where I bought my ticket to get any return.

9. Throughout this, nobody from their behalf came forward to address any issue. Every time I needed to seek their attention to speak. They were extremely rude and unprofessional. Sometimes, in the middle of conversation they will start walking away or start talking to someone else. They will talk while leaning on the desk, without even looking at me.

Fortunately, I used credit cards to pay for the ticket and penalty. So, I easily got back the money as I disputed those charges. Go Amex and Discover"

But due to some reasons the flight got canceled. Surprisingly I did not even receive any email saying that the flight is canceled and need to reschedule to another flight. I realized this thing when I checked the PNR status in the air India Site simply. Then started my trouble. 

I was (am) calling customer care service but the wait time is about 1-2 hours. When I ask for a reschedule , support agent says they will have to connect to Ticketing department, and the call does not even connect. We wait like a sheep for 2 hours and finally call will disconnect.  I have tried  6 times and every time is same scenario. Wasted my whole 12 hours on waiting on a call with no result. And in the AirIndia site I cannot event  cancel the ticket as upon giving the PNR number in managed booking,  the ticket is not retrieving. So we are purely dependent on Customer care but that never connects.  Still trying to call them but no luck

I would not recommend this air lines to travel . Very poor in customer support. Very very bad.."

I have been waiting for my refund ever since and there have been no courtesy messages sent back despite the countless number of calls and emails I have sent them.

I have heard from other friends and family that other airlines have issued refunds to them when the pandemic happened and here is our lovely airline taking their own sweet time to even respond to an email. 

The agents over the phone are a bit clueless because I don't think the management has even given them the adequate steps to take when a customer is calling for a refund. They seem a bit too lost every time I speak to them. Each time they give me a different number to ring or a different email to write to.

"2021-07-06T17:19:44-04:00","1","review","2","Worst airline out there, categorically the worst","All travellers be warned. Air India is a beggar airline. They will take your money and you will never see it again, even if you do your due diligence and cancel within 24 hours, even if you call them every other day for 2 month, wait on hold for hours, write 20 emails and create 5 escalated cases with their sub standard, rude and good for nothing customer support agents. 

All of the above happened to me. I booked a business class ticket and tried to cancel online but the system was down so I called to cancel within 24 hours. But the customer support agent casually said, and I quote ""please call back later. The system is undergoing maintenance and I cannot cancel at this time"". That was my first red flag. What kind of an agent cannot cancel even it the user cannot cancel?

So I left an email asking them to cancel within 24 hours. 

I called several times after that and I got the same response:

1. I'd have to pay the $200 cancellation charge because the 24 hours has passed. Otherwise, they said its wise to hold off on cancelling until my escalated case would be reviewed by someone at a higher level (classic Indian bureaucracy). 

2. That the customer agents do not have access to emails because they just dont and only the backend team can see my emails (this was new. I haven't heard of any other airline that keeps its phone staff and email staff separate). 

3. That I'd get a response within 24 to 48 hours (but didnt). Even if I did, it was always automated or tightly scripted (was I ever talking to a human?).

Exhausted with the constant back and forth and going nowhere for a month but before my flight date, I called them to cancel my booking, agreeing to pay the $200. I was promised that my escalated case would be seen to but it never was.

I left them multiple requests in email, in consumer.com, on their feedback form but talking to these people is like talking to a wall. 

If you dont believe me, please go look at airindia reviews on any website or consumer complaint websites and you'll read all the horror stories. All of them are true. 

Save yourself the hassle, please book somewhere else, unless you're desperate and there are no other flights."

There isn’t enough space to write everything but here’s a summary:
- Business class has middle seats! Yes you read that right.
- much costlier than other airlines. Compared United to same journey, business class is cheaper by around $300 and they have tie ups with COVID testing sites.
- they cancel flights without letting anyone know. Only indication is retrieving your booking fails. Yep - and airline that doesn’t tell you if they cancel the flight. 
- God help you if you decide to cancel - they won’t return your money. No Sir! We’ve been calling every week for 7 weeks now. Still no sign of refund. Internet has horror stories of refunds taking even longer. 
- absolutely downright pathetic and rude staff.
- if you think their ground staff are bad, try their call center. Not making this up - one of the calls I couldn’t hear the guy because his internet connection was so bad and when it was okay there was a loud party going on in the background. 
- couple of times I had to insist on asking for a supervisor and the response is to disconnect the line
- website is slow and too busy, looks like it’s designed by a high school kid in the 1980s
- I had a query for them - called them no less than 11 times. Different answers each time. Finally I took the best answer that said come to airport early and we’ll sort it out. Came early - they don’t even open the damn kiosk that early. Waited and waited. Finally a lady said no to the request. We said but we called and some said it was doable. She says no and walks away.

Inflight food is OK but with unpleasant airhostess attitude you feel like why did you fly. The service is the same even in business class.

Despite of hours on the phone to customer service reps and several emails to various departments, they failed to give me a definite answer about my refund(even though it stated that refund will be processed within 7-21 working days. I understand the covid situation and it’s impact, but they could have send me an email explaining the delay for refund and ensuring the definite refund. 
Thankfully, As I payed using my MasterCard, I ended up getting the refund through them. Still no response from air India.

Despite of the polite nature of the customer service reps, they didn’t have a clue to answer my questions and to clarify them. The English was very poor too and hence difficult to communicate efficiently.

At first they said my ticket is not confirmed so I called Air India customer service and they were like it’s all good, I should be able checkin and board. I told that to the Air India staff at the airport. So then they changed their reasoning and were like this is Vandebharat and not Air India. I don’t remember  booking for Vandebharat, AirIndia made that change on their end without consulting. So I requested to do any type of accommodation but nobody at the airport or their customer service offered any kind of help. They made us run from one place to another and even thou they had office there, they were like office is not here but some place far. Then, I called United since my connecting flight was with United Airline after multiple tries, I was able get United to talk to Air India and United was able to get us a solution. Guess what? AirIndia has another flight 45 mins after this flight to same destination, they just didn’t wanted to help me out. United Airlines customer service agent was able to help us book that other flight with AirIndia and I was able to get on that flight. Thank you to customer service agent from united or else I would have had to just go back and book entirely new flight. He was kind enough to help us even thou it was an error on Airindia end. 

AirIndia did not take even slightest responsibility in all this. Worst airline and worst airport workers ever. Eventhou AirIndia customer service agents were not rude, they provided zero help or support. Never taking that flight ever again, I wish I rate then in a negative number."

Worst airlines ever!","I generally don't curse anyone to the extent that I want something bad to happen to that particular individual/company/organization etc. but Air India tops in my list. I was tempted to book the non-stop flight from SFO to BLR and I booked the trip to India in April but soon it turned into a disastrous experience for me. I didn't get my RT-PCR test result on time so Air India didn't allow me to board the flight. Least they could do is put me on the next flight which typically runs half empty due as not many people prefer travelling during the pandemic. Air India was adamant about their so called policy and didn't offer to help. Customer service is so bad that the folks on the line aren't even trained enough to understand the situation. Talk to a new person you get a new perspective of their policy. I had to rebook my trip at my own expense after spending a night at a hotel. Sadly, I had no other option but take Air India that day. I board the flight and get seated and I notice the seating area hasn't been cleaned even. This is probably a time where cleanliness is at its peak and Air India just doesn't care! The infotainment doesn't work. Feels like its running on a Windows 95 OS and just struggles to boot. One can only dream of having a good time on this flight.  Now I have a return flight with them and I am desperate to cancel it and needless to say Air India will introduce all sorts of fees to loot its customers even in times where there is travel ban or other pressing issues. Apparently you won't even be getting any communication once you request for refund. Why? Because Air India's ""policy"" says so!! Business is important but customers aren't. Shame on you Air India.

"2021-05-12T08:08:51-04:00","1","review","1","I Am Crying. So Upset. So Unbelievable","I booked a trip to India on a medical visa with Air India. 
My flight from JFK was delayed because they were handing out masks, robes, and face shields. I asked what to do about my connection since I only had one hour layover and the representative said the connecting flight would wait. Once on the plane all passengers were seated in the same 10 rows without social distance while the remainder of the plane was EMPTY. I asked if I could change my seat to an empty row and the first flight attendant said NO seat changes. Luckily another flight attendant heard the interaction and secretly helped me into another seat further away from other people. The flight obviously arrived late in Delhi so I missed my connecting flight to Bengaluru. The man who helped me reprimanded me for missing my connection even though it was not my fault. I had to wait an additional 8 hours for a new flight. The airline should never have booked this series of connecting flights with a 1-hour layover. 

I have contacted the airline to make a change to my ticket with the same itinerary on a different day and they booked the WRONG flight from BLR to DEL giving me another 1-hour layover at the airport. My mother, my father and myself have all called countless times to attempt to fix this so that I have a longer layover because if I miss my flight from DEL to JFK I will have to wait in Delhi for three days for the next flight to New York. That means high covid risk for me. 

A customer service representative said that it would cost money to change their mistake. Another representative said that the flight from BLR to DEL is ONLY Americans flying to JFK and that the flights will wait (I’ve heard this lie before). Another representative said that they could not complete the request on the phone and to send an email instead. Three different representatives HUNG up the call. Another representative said they would not change the ticket unless the original travel agent who booked the flights called themselves to change the flight. 

So I am crying from frustration and disbelief as I do not know how I will get home to the United States and I am legitimately afraid for my safety. My family is scared for me and worried because of this extreme lack of customer service help or support. The news on covid in India is terrifying. I cannot believe how hard it is to find my way home. 

I am contacting my travel agent to see if they can cancel this return trip for a refund so that I can book another airline altogether. 

I would give ZERO stars if I could."

The early and mid 80s were the golden years of air travel and Air India, Thomas Cook ( travel agency) formed our memories. Even then Air India was notorious for customer service ...  ticketing was a time consuming process which often involved going to the ticketing office in Hyderabad and badgering the staff as they tend to be as bureaucratic as an SBI banker.   No wonder the graffitti in their toilet was ""Fabulous prices, lousy service"".

Having lived in the US for almost half of my middle aged life, Air India beckoned as patriotic fervor overpowered the seeming inconvenience of a limited network and the sedate ""aged"" flight attendants ( stewardesses or air hostesses as they were know back in the day). 

There was a travel ban due to COVID and I had to pick between Air India & United. I naturally opted for Air India despite it being 20% more expensive than United for a one way ticket as my return flight by British Airways was cancelled.

I tried booking with a few of my Indian debit cards which simply did not work but eventually I used my US credit card which went through but I had an error message ""Your payment has been collected, sorry we are not able to ticket your booking due to some technical reasons,  we shall mail the tickets to you shortly"" ...
well I thought it was strange that I did not even have a PNR number. I called the Ar India call center and after about 15 mins , spoke to a live agent that aws able to lookup he PNR number and reassured me that it will go through and he asked me to wait for about 8 hrs since it was booked online, the ""SYSTEM"" would generate a ticket and email it. I waited the whole day and I called subsequently in the night ( 1AM)  and to my dismay I could not even see the reservation. Upon waiting for anout 30 mins I got hold of an agent who calmly inormed me that my reservation was cancelled and there was no availability for a similar itinerary.

While on hold, the announcer tells my position in the queue and how long I might need to wait .. all these numbers are bogus and at best random numbers because how can one's position in the queue go from 10 to 30 and the time from 2 hours to 30 mins etc ....

I booked through United and got a cheaper fare and it was a hassle free experience like it should be ...

Why is life so hard in India??  It is companies like Air India and banks like SBI that think that the average Indian is not discerning and can be pushed around ...which is why even British Airways likes to use 30 year old aircraft without USB charging ports in their seats for their India routes unlike flights that ply between US and Europe which are more modern and have better amenities."

Torn fabric of the seats, leg rest button not working, seat when done flat has a bump in the middle, only way to deal with that is to sleep on your side, no place to put personal nits and bits with the seats. Basically an economy type seat which will become flat barring some buttons not working completely. No blankets, no bedspread, no pillow, no cloth napkins. No Jazz!!

Covid 19 has been blessing for AI. This gives them good reason to do NO SERVICE. Large number of attendants do the welcome and departure with folded hands and that is the extent of the service. They huddle in the galley and never show up. If you ask for something, there is always some sort of negative attached to the response. These people have no hospitality training whatsoever. Only one meal service. No Beverage service. Meal service is in a prepackaged tray with meals likely packed a week ago. Yogurt had dry crust. No alcohol except for a one small bottle of horrible SULA  wine. Cheap cheap cheap. 
I bet 75% of the passengers in business and first class were non paying passengers who got upgrade by ""knowing someone"" in Air India or aviation ministry.

My suggestion: sell this behemoth to TATA or someone who knows how to do business and fire at least 80 percent of senior staff without any termination package. Completely revamp inflight service training. Send them to Oberoi or Tata for some courtesy and hospitality training before they step into an airport. Mr Amit Shah and Mr Modi Ji please do something!!.

It is disgrace that in India where you get best service in hospitality in hotels and resorts has a national airline which so dysfunctional. Disgrace to these IAS officers and secretary of ministries of aviation for doing a very lousy job."

Now, I didn't expect an emirates quality experience from their business class, but I did expect something that could be in the slightest worth some of the money we paid. The only difference between the economy class and Business was that Business so kindly welcomed us with child-like cartons of mango juice, and perhaps a bigger seat and leg space, apart from that there was nothing else I could differentiate between the two. The TV's seemed to be bizarrely covered and not able to use. Now, I appreciate the extra leg space, and the free mango juice but I do not think (in my humble opinion)   its worth an extra £600.

- Had to book separate flight via Indigo airline from Bengaluru to Chennai on my own expense.
Airline response:
- We have problems with Bengaluru immigration on Air Bubble policy
- We have for future travelers cancelled this leg of the itinerary
- Sorry for the inconvenience
- Refund procedure is not worth your time, you will get very little money
- Everybody is affected due to COVID"

Check in process was smooth, temperature checks, covid results, other documents, etc. Boarding process was chaos. Snacks were already in the seat pockets. Everyone was issued a mask, visor and hand sanitizer packets. Flight was approximately 15 hours to Delhi. Hot food was served 3 times. Entertainment system was broken. Flight attendants handed out customs and immigration forms and announced the procedure. 
Upon landing in New Delhi, after a long walk from the gate, process was again chaos, but manageable. Officials stamped boarding passes for those with exemptions and covid reports. Immigration was quick and smooth. Final exit had 6 counters with health officials reviewing covid reports. Upon stamp from the final counter, you may exit the arrivals area. Domestic entrance was right outside from the arrivals area, checked bags and proceeded to security, and arrived at the domestic gates.
Flight to Chennai was about 2.5 hours, hot food was served. Upon arrival at Chennai, international and domestic passengers were separated and ask to provide covid results and contact information. Thermal scanning was also done to all passengers upon arrival in Chennai."

When I had to change a ticket soon after booking there was no option to do so on Air India’s website. When I called customer service they said their site was down. I called back hourly and finally when their site was back up the customer service people I spoke to could not help me cancel my tickets. I called multiple times and asked to speak to a manager and every time I was told it was against their policy!!!! I questioned tjsf policy and was hung up on. I will never fly Air India again even it it means I will not be able to take a direct flight to India- I do not trust this airline. Aside from the horrific customer service I recently experienced I can also attest from traveling in India air in 2019 and 2020 that the planes are old, not well maintaining nor clean. It’s a government entity in a developing nation so I guess that explains why it’s broken"

"2021-03-12T09:28:53-05:00","3","review","2","Its okay airlines. Lot of room for improvement.","During these covid-19 times, I had to visit my home country and selected Air India. I would say that it was an average experience. Air India definitely does not feel like the Emirates or other better flagship carriers for the following reasons,

1. The website is really really bad. It does not work in some browsers like Firefox. The layouts are out of place. Lot of things does not even load. The information presented is not very intuitive in presentation.

2. I had to extend my flight for personal reason, and I could not do that online. I had to call Air India customer service number and for some unknown reason, every time the call used to get cut automatically once the operator puts you on hold. They said that in case call gets cut, they will call back automatically, but they don't do.

3. The inflight experience is average. I say this because some seats have broken entertainment system. Remote control does not have working buttons or in some cases missing buttons. I needed some help from the staff but the button to call inflight crew was not working.

Although it lacks in certain areas, following are some of the positive experiences,

1. The general staff is helpful and nice.

2. Food was great. I asked for Indian Vegetarian food, and it did not disappoint.

3. They took enough precautions at Indian airports for Covid-19 checking."

"2021-03-04T15:03:29-05:00","1","review","3","Terrible Customer Service. Not able to board the flight even with all right documents","We were all excited to travel to India. We had all the documents ready and did the web check-in in advance. 

After reaching the SFO airport 3.5 hours in advance, we had to wait for 30 minutes to do a Thermal Checking to find the body temperature, which was at a random place and pretty confusing. We guided several passengers on how to get there.

After that, at the Air India counter to check in our luggage, they asked for the negative COVID-19 results. I gave them the printout I took, which said negative COVID-19 test results with ""PCR"" testing from Kaiser Permanente, which is an internationally recognized hospital. The lady at the counter was frantically searching for the word, ""RT-PCR"" and said we cannot board the flight since our document doesn't contain the word, ""RT-PCR"". We tried to reason with her but she asked us to talk to her supervisor for any queries. So, we talked to the supervisor and He said the same. The document needs to have RT-PCR and not PCR. I called my physician at Kaiser and gave the phone to him so that she could explain it in my medical terms. 
My physician tried to explain that even though Kaiser does RT-PCR testing, the term used in the COVID testing in the US is PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing and it follows all the CDC guidelines. He was not even ready to listen and was repeating the same thing, He needs to have the word RT-PCR in the result document.
After that, I called Air India support, where the customer service representative was able to understand my situation and said they wanted to talk to this supervisor. The customer service representative said the COVID-19 negative test result I have is sufficient to board the flight but this supervisor said He will not accept that. 

After 3 hours of trying and reasoning, we were not able to board the flight. We called customer service to cancel the ticket. They said they will charge us $100 for the cancellation fee and $200 for the no-show fee. I said we showed up but you didn't allow me to board the flight. They said they can't help it because I didn't board the flight and have to charge a no-show fee. This whole thing is a complete mess. So many people were not able to board the flight and had the same problem as us. 

Advice for travelers traveling during this time:
Do get the COVID-19 test results with the word, RT-PCR in it from external labs like IGeneX or whichever travel-oriented test service at your location and reimburse the fee from your medical insurance provider."

Ms. Nikita Shinde on the Mumbai International Airport should reconsider how she approaches her staff and the customers of Air India. I will never make the mistake of flying with Air India. Ms. Nikita Shinde disregarded the advice of her supervisor and added the laptop bag’s weight onto the handbag weight. She argued and harassed me about this for 30 minutes to scare me. She wanted me to pay extra $250.00 for this. She and Air India simply wanted the money. How disgusting. AIR INDIA PLEASE INFORM YOUR EMPLOYEES OF YOUR RULES AND DONT CHARGE MONEY FOR PATHETIC SERVICE LIKE THIS. Air India should not be hiring employees that have absolutely no morals in terms of how to treat customers with respect but instead resort to demeaning body language such as rolling the eyes. Greedy employees are a staple of Air India’s service and it is horrific that Air India represents such a great nation. The supervisor agreed to let the bags go and she argued with the supervisor saying that she will not allow it under her name when her supervisor said that it is fine. To blatantly ignore and go against the supervisor and then to continue to scare the customers simply for extra money is repulsive treatment, especially during the times of the covid pandemic. One should be thinking not of profit but of compassion. It is not just a shame to have such awful employees  and treatment but it is a disservice to Air India to tolerate such behavior. Proper action should be taken to rectify what happened and prevent this harassment from happening to anyone else in the future."

It’s better these type of businesses should shut down, any how they are bringing countries reputation to dust.

The Ticketing staff at Delhi Terminal 3 is worst, I don’t know if they even check their educational credentials at all before hiring.

I had to stand for 2 hours just to drop bags even after e-checking and when my turn came I was thrown here and there and charged filthy amount of Rs 20,000 just for luggage weight. I don’t Mind giving the amount if it’s the rule and is legit.

The behind desk person named Manoj Rana just in front of me let go a girl without even weighing her carry on telling her, why do you want to weight it, if you can lift it, that  means it’s not that’s heavy, like seriously and the same guy charged me around Rs 600 per kg, he made me weight every luggage of myne.

I don’t mind doing that but what I saw him doing with that girl and this discrimination literally is totally unprofessional, unethical and wrong at so many levels.

I flew from US, had option of either taking Indigo or Air India, took Air India as was just feeling patriotic, never again will I fly with these unprofessional people.

They have no idea about any rules, all the staff is rude especially the young guys.

Date of travel 2nd feb 2021 from Chennai airport.
Well with the covid 19 situation,landed at Chennai airport terminal 4 for the scheduled flight  AI1126 to New Delhi  departure 20.25 hrs,at 5.25pm. There were many flights around this time and it was all chaos.
Air India staff exercised extraordinary patience while checking all documents ,in particular,covid negative reports with all details like,passport number ,d.o.b.,test sample time etc. We wondered if we can catch the flight in time,as it took a lot of time. Rushed to the baggage scan followed by visiting the counter for boarding passes,having completed,web check in.(mobile app wasn’t allowing web check in). Immigration was well organised and a kit of visor,sanitizer and mask and ppe kit was provided at the immigration entrance.to security check.
Security check was another delay area,where due measures were in place.
The boarding gates(17) was less crowded. With hardly a few counters for a coffee or snacks,it was really difficult to get even a cup of coffee at krishna,with a coffee costing Rs190/
Boarding was comfortable.Upto Hyderabad,nothing was served in the flight. As a middle seat passenger ,ppe suit has to be worn compulsorily before boarding.
A good meal was served at about 10pm while leaving Hyderabad to Delhi 
Flight landed in delhi terminal 3 arrivals by about 0.45 am 3rd feb 2021.
With flight AI 173 to SFO scheduled at 4am 3rd feb,it was a close to 2km walk(walkathon disabled) to the international transfer with a security check,to gate3B,as economy class passenger.
After waiting for quite sometime, awaiting departure,comes the announcement,that people get out and queue up for a check.
Another security check and documents check,we were given a kit if masks viser and ppe kit and headed to the aircraft Boeing 777 300ER
There was no blankets but,earphone and a snacks pack,fairly loaded with a variety of snacks.we found it ample.
Dinner(call it lunch/brunch) was served nearly 7 hrs after boarding and we found the same good.
Flight had taken off at 4.30am but landed clear 30 min ahead,by 5.30 am SFO local time.
We were provided customs declaration form to be filled and kept ready as well as covid reports for a random check by health officials 
Customs (USCIS) took time as another flight AA from Delhi had landed ahead.
I was surprised that the manual system and not kiosk process was followed at SFO.
It took a near 100 min to clear through.
Air India had kept the toilets neat to begin with but we’re really wanting cleanliness after use by many.Else the airindia trip was fully enjoyable with courteous staff."

The flight was scheduled to depart at 11:55 AM from Toronto airport; however, our flight on 2nd Jan was delayed by 5 hours due to flight maintenance. As a result all the passengers had to spend additional time waiting at the airport during Covid time. As a result of the long delay all the passengers with connecting Domestic flights had to again check in baggage at the Delhi airport. 
The flight was flying at full capacity so physical distancing is not possible. One positive was - they gave us PPE kits and in flight meals.

I am angry at the long delay at Toronto airport something that the airline could have avoided. Physical distancing is also a big concern which I believe is not under the airline's control unless there is seat capacity mandate from the Government for passenger safety. 
I was tested Covid negative before starting my trip from Toronto but unfortunately after my trip I have been tested positive and as a result I thought it would be better to share my experience."

It all began when we arrived the airport and attempted to get our luggage checked in. We weighed our luggage and it was about 90 kgs and as per international flight for each individual is permissible to take 30kg and we were 3 people. However, they charged us 45 thousand Indian rupees even tho we hadn't outdid the maximum weight. They perhaps need to re-do 3rd grade as it's simple sence that 3 times 3 is 90. Even tho we agreed to pay as we had a though the time for our visa to be stamped. We decided to ask another employee how much our weight was and how much we had to pay, she told us a different amount than the first employee, therefore it was a confirmed scam. But we had no other choice that to go with this cruelness. While paying, they told us they won't take card nor google pay etc. And they needed cash. We had to run around to get the money. We weren't the only ones to be cheated for luggage. Probably 3/4 people travelling were screaming at the counters for scamming, an old man near us had a bag that might not even weight 10 kgs, he was charged 4 thousand Indian rupees(he was going on an international trip too). He didn't have change and the employee asked that poor old man to go get the money in change, not caring a bit that the flight will departure soon. We started the check-in process at 4 am but it hadn't ended till 7. We weren't the only passengers here either, all of air India passengers were trying to get their luggage (with a whole lot of money taken) departured. It was a terrible experience. But it didn't end there. While the checking was going on a lot of people were late for the flights and there was no social distancing, the employees didn't even care about the pandemic right now. Air India seriously needs better staff if they want to keep their business going, not mentioning the fact their flights are horrible too. Speaking about the flight, seats were unbearable, it felt like my bones are falling off. The food was a disaster, I saw a lot of un-eaten, moderately full plates of food thrown away, even tho India believes to be a country where food doesn't go to waste. But this ased like old rusted metal served on a plate. Even expired food tastes better. I had to give it 1 star as 0 wasn't even possible. I think they know how horrible the service is that they had to block the 0 ratings."

I called Air India customer service three different times to cancel my flight ticket and get the money back less the cancellation fees. I had to call three times, each time with 20-30 minutes waiting time, before I get to talk to the agent. Despite the vocal confirmations from the AI agents (one guy put me on hold and just disappeared), my tickets were never cancelled and no money was refunded to me. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen. I will never travel by Air India again! 

I used to travel by Air India for international travel due to the convenience of the flight arrival and departure times (ORD-HYD). However, sometimes the video monitors would not work or audio jack would not work or the seats are not good. There is always something. Flight attendants are good, but sub-par amenities!

I have never seen an airline serve so much food on a domestic 2-hour flight (it kept me full during a 10-hour layover).

It was a wonderful experience to fly Air India. Right from entry at Bhopal Entrance where the luggage was first sanitized, then due to contactless policy of COVID norms everything thing was digital. The Air India staff was cooperative and all things including check-in, security etc went fine. At the Boarding gate the Air India staff provided us the PPE kit and mask plus faceshield and sanitizer. Since mine was middle seat I had to wear PPE kit in addition to mask and Faceshield. Boarding started well in time maintaining social distance. Since mine was 3b seat I was allowed to Board in the last batch. This practice was really good to have less contact. The flight started as soon as boarding was completed and left before time. The in-flight experience was also good with less disturbance. We reached Delhi 15 minutes before. The Protective gear were disposed by us at Airport. After taking luggage we left by Taxi to Bareilly.

When I went to board my Delhi Sydney flight home AI charged me a $300 penalty for not cancelling the original Kolkata to Delhi leg of my multi city ticket. They then forbid me to board my Delhi Sydney flight and charged me a $400 penalty for that and escorted me out of IGA with rifle-weilding guards.
I then had to pay for another nights accommodation in Delhi. On return to Australia the next day, jetlagged.. I'd missed my Australian domestic flights home and had to pay again extra for that.
Note, you cancel an AI flight you lose the entire cost of the ticket. Tip - fly Singapore Airlines instead, same price point, full ticket refund if you cancel, and none of this shocking treatment and exploitation of customers.
My original return AI flight was $1000.the penalties (excluding the extra Kolkata to Delhi flight I took) were $950!!! In total more than a Grand including the extra night I was forced to spend in Dehi.
Fly Air India again? I'd rather walk."

Before booking my ticket I spoke to Air India contact centre who informed me it’s a direct flight to Goa with no hault. I reconfirmed with the staff over the phone because it was showing two different airline number and he said not to worry it will be the same flight and I won’t have to change.

I booked evacuation flight on 21st July from London UK Heathrow to Goa,India.
Due to my OCI renewal for the new passport I had to cancel this booking by calling Air India contact centre.
PNR number is HBEMD and e-ticket number is 0982133617468.
Your colleague from Contact centre informed that he has cancelled flight and refund will be processed on the same card in 21days without any cancellation fees. This was in July. 
After 21 days I still didn’t receive refund and when I call Air India contact centre and emailed e-commerce who gave me another 3 weeks. I completed that waiting time and still didn’t receive my refund. I again emailed e-commerce on 6th October who replied to wait for another 3 to 4 weeks. 😳 
Looks like the company is trying their best not to refund my card I used for the payment.
I do understand the inconvenience caused due to the covid situation but if you can sell you flights full then why do you hassle to refund in given time frame.
Please look into this and don’t make a joke of it by asking to wait another 3 to 4 weeks. 
I have attached conversations with your colleagues.

Hopefully 🙏🏼 this time I might receive my money back. 

I’m in India now but you can email me on Fernandes13sebastiao@gmail.com"

On March 3rd I arrived at the airport around 11:45 and didn't find any counter open to check in my luggage and issue my boarding pass until 1 PM. When the counters open at 1 PM, the officials started evacuating the airport for a Bomb Scare, &sent us to an assembly point less than 1 km away from the airport. The ambulance and the firefighters arrived, & the speaker were announcing inaudible things. I was so scared that I called my family back home to let them know what's happening. I decided to leave the airport and go back to downtown to ensure my safety. 
I called the customer care line around 5 times on that day to rebook my flight for the next day and change the dates. The agents kept cutting lines and putting me on hold for long, then they finally came back to me and told me that it is too late to change the flight because it is considered (No Show) and that I was supposed to call more than hour before the departure. I was actually on the phone ON Hold all the time when it was still more than 1 Hour before departure. They then referred me to Air India's airport office (who wasn't answering the phone) and said “they might have authorities to fix the situation”. I asked them if even the return flight was cancelled because I need to save time and book a new flight for the next day? They had no answer. They kept repeating the same words (it’s a no show, we have no authority to refund you Nor reschedule your flights).
I booked a new round trip flight and on the next day I went to the airport and spoke to the Air India agents, they referred me to an email. I also asked about the Evacuation, and the agent laughed and said it was just an “Exercise”. 
1) I lost the money I paid for my 1st Round Trip, and my Non Refundable hotel in Mysore, and paid an extra Nights in a hotel in Bangalore, in addition to that I paid for a new round trip.

I flew finally to Mysore and had to return to Bangalore to catch my international flight in the beginning of April. India was on lock down and my country and India closed their boarders. I sent an email to Air India Customer Care, for a refund for my (second return ticket of the 2nd round trip).  All I got was, we will not refund you! Such a disappointment and loss of money and energy."

So, I made a payment for the upgrade ( link sent to me on my email by the cal centre team)  and got the new tickets, however, at the airport I was told that the seats are not available and I will be provided with refund.
 
Due to the poor coordination between the ground staff, priority seating was not provided to me even though i made the payment and had the new confirmation tickets.

Being the only airline currently plying people to the India they have monopoly over the air transportation and have lowered they're standards even further. 

The misery begins online with an extremely outdated website that makes navigating to your section of interest particularly hard. They're rules about student offers and excess baggage are extremely vague and have unrealistic expectations where they expect students to book they're return ticket for months/years in advance and only then do they recieve student perks. This is extremely unrealistic since most students going abroad to study area unable to book they're return flights back home that much in advance. Air India is also one of the only airlines that has this clause,  other prominent like Emirates, Singapore Airlines and British Airways have no such unrealistic demands and let you avail of student offers on a single journey. 

The next stage of your miserable experience greeets you at the airport in the form of impolite, misinformed ground staff that you will encounter while trying to check in and drop off your luggage. They're lack of knowledge on they're companies guidelines and policies is appalling! 

The only pleasant staff I encountered were the pursers who welcome you aboard, they're polite demeanor almost made up for the incompotent staff I earlier encountered, but the rest of the cabin crew was, again, not particularly pleasant. 

The WORST part of this trip was the fact that they're inflight entertainment systems were ""Under Maintainence"" and I had to endure a ten hour journey with nothing but a blank screen in front of me. To make things worse all the plug points on the plane were ""Down"" and it was impossible to charge a phone or laptop and amuse yourself with your personal electronic devices unless you, keeping Air India's tardiness in mind, had charged all your devices and back up batteries to the max.

And if you thought this flight couldn't possibly get any worse, lo-and-behold,  the reading lights didn't work either! So if you thought you could spend a few leisurely hours curled up with a good book, Air India has stumped you, yet again. About 70% of this flight took place between dusk and dawn. Furthermore, the cabin lights were dimmed for most of the flight so if you couldn't fall asleep you were left spending about seven miserable hours in dark - miserable, cramped and bored!"

My flights got canceled due to Covid, and I had no problem at all to get my refunds from other airlines from Thailand and Myanmar, but it's been a nightmare with AIRINDIA.

You try to contact AirIndia @contactus but for some weird reason they can't help you with bookings or refund (????) or anything at all. Then you try to contact @ecommerce as suggested by Airindia itself and there is where the show begins. They will start helpful, apologetic, they ask you your PNR number, date of travels, etc, and then, they DISAPPEAR. Then you try to contact them again, trying to follow up, and they come up with another story, like you need to call the company in India because they need vocal confirmation, or that they will help you with your re-booking no problem at all, or if you can please share your PNR number (you have no idea how many times I had to share that information).

It's not only the worst experience I've ever had when it comes to an airline, it's mockery I cannot stand, and the fact that I probably lost more than a $1K to a horrible company.

However, Air India is saying they will refund the money only to them who booked from 23rd March. So people who booked flight for 22nd March will not get the refund. I was told to call e-commerce department but no one answers the phone there even if I waited for 30 to 45 Minutes to be connected. 

Secondly, I booked the flights from Chicago to India because I had to come back to India as I lost my job due to this pandemic Covid-19. I’m not sure I flew under “Vande Bharat Mission” or “Save Air India Mission”. The price was higher than the regular. I thought Air India took initiative to bring Indians back to India but I was wrong because Air India is getting profitable business in this pandemic specially from those people who have lost their jobs. 

Now whatever I’m going to write it has no link with what I wrote above. Being in the hospitality industry, This is my observation in the flight from Chicago to Delhi. I was impressed because Air India staff was conscious about the precautions from
Covid-19 at the time boarding. It was mandatory for every one to wear face shield and mask and sealed food on each seat inside the flight but I saw there was no instructions for social distances as it was at the airport. Most of the airlines have blocked middle seats in the aircraft to keep distance between two passengers but Air India is not following this because more passengers more profit. So people were seating next to each other with no choice. 
In 13+ hours flight they provided us one sandwich, one juice and some snacks such as chips packet, one, nuts, one croissant, butter, cheese, yogurt etc. I don’t think that I have to mention here the quantity or size of the snacks as every one knows. Basically, There was not even one proper meal. 

As soon as I took my seat, I tried to keep my food on fold-out table. Unfortunately the fold out table had a missing screw so the things were slipping and falling over me. Somehow I managed. Then, I decided to watch something in-flight entertainment system but there was something wrong. So by pointing on system I asked the staff, “Excuse me! Is it not working?” He replied, “ Yes ! It’s not working.” And he left without apologizing for the inconvenience. Actually, In-flight entertainment system was not working anyone, so I was not the only lucky one. 
Toilets were horrible. I haven’t seen toilets in this condition in any flight, even in the cheapest flights. There were stickers behind the toilet seat I don’t know whether those sticker were to hide some crack or not but surely it was not appropriate. The surrounding of soap dispenser and tap was covered by dirty moss. No supply of tissues. Once finished is finished. I went to get some extra bottled water and I found one of the staff members was sleeping or napping sitting up while on duty. 

I understand some annoying guests make the staff irritated but when you work in hospitality industry as a staff member you have to polite all the time, you can’t be aggressive. However, I saw staff talking to other guests by pointing finger on them and with Forehead Furrows. 

Also when I entered in the aircraft was greeted just for formality. Usually “Namaskar” greeting accompanied by hand gesture in which palms are together but her fingers of both hands were barely touching each other. While leaving the aircraft, none of the staff members was thanking the guests. There were two staff members were standing at the door quietly. 

I’m not going to write any suggestion. Air India must know what to do."

There is one flight on 11 June to Jammu airport. Wait I will get a call from air India. I told them last month same thing happens but I didn't received any call from air India. My father is very sick now I need to be with him. They said don't worry this time air India surely will call me. But same thing repeated again. I wait for air India call, no one called me this time. My father's health getting critical now. I called the embassy no answer. I try to call air India office in Dubai. Seems both embassy and air India staff are sleeping on duty. I tweet air India on twitter about my situation no one responded. I was so helpless. Finally my father passed away on 4th July. Still I am struggling to get a ticket. I went to embassy also. Finally in embassy they answered my call and I explained what air India did to me. They said they also don't know what air India is doing. My name is there in list to go India. Still they didn't called me. Then embassy raised an emergency request to send me to India as I gave them my father's death certificate. After that air India call me and book a flight for me.
I want to ask air India. When my name is in the list to evacuate and I got call twice from Consulate general of India dubai. Both time they told me I will get a call from air India . Why Air India never called me. Why you guys only consider a emergency is actually a emergency after someone's death. If I got the called from air India in may only may be I could treat my father in a better place. May be he is still alive and healthy. Never trust air India."

Is this the way Air India is helping people to evacuate? I am sorry to say but would recommend everyone never ever book flights with Air India who is letting India down."

They charge 4 times the price during this so called Vande Bharat Mission, what kind of mission is this, I had a British Air return ticket for 58000, but using this rediculous airline i endup paying nearly 2 lacs for the return in total.
While checkin, they leave us with no information for 7 hours and oblige us with a $12 food voucher, made us sit in the aircraft with no airconditioning for 2 hours and no information at all.
Do or Die in whichever part of world you are, but dont fly this Airline.

Having no other option I booked in Business class which showed 1200 GBP ea as I reached the payment part it read 1650 GBP ea.This is pure cheating. The flight snack was terrible. Dry.No meals. At Delhi airport all of a sudden we were told to change planes. My computer hard disk was left back inadvertently in the seat due to haste. Afterwards when I enquired from the lost and Found Department,I was told nothing found. Surely it was pocketed by ground crew. I was treated discourteously by all ground staff. Previously I was returned a mobile phone Which I had left by Emirates which courtesy and professionalism.At Kolkata wait for luggage was 50 minutes. Overall I am  disappointed with Air India."

I am writing to inform you of my current situation.  I had a confirmed airticket to fly to Auckland from Delhi on 21 June 2020. 

I reached airport on time and was told at checkout that flight is full and I was late so I couldn't fly. I was devastated to hear that as I had traveled all the way from Himachal to Delhi with two young daughters. I have receipt from airport which confirms that I entered air port on time. You can also check air port cctv footage if  needed. 

I am now try to book ticket on another flight but call centre  staff is giving me different information everytime I call. I request you to please assist me and help me with another ticket on next available flight to Auckand. I am eligible to fly to Auckland.

Look forward to hearing from you.

"2020-06-20T11:28:25-04:00","1","review","1","Worst travel experience","We purchased expensive AI business class tickets for our family (2 adults & 2 kids) trip to india (from SFO->DEL in the end of Jan, 2020). Myself & my 10 year son returned in 2 weeks (to attend school & work) while my wife along my 3 year old son stayed back in India a bit more but eventually they unfortunately got stuck in India due COVID-19 related situation. We were charged change fees on first re-schedule of the 2 tickets for their return flight as my wife fell sick around date of return (first week of March). Most of the airlines were waiving off the change fees though. And the re-scheduled flight (in April) did not take off due to lock down in India.

Eventually after announcement of special repatriation Air India flights when we saw some hope to get them back here in SFO & re-unite the eniter family BUT we struggled painfully trying to get them re-booked. Waited for hours and hours on countless occasions for several days on wait/music trying to get someone from customer service over phone and all the time no meaningful help was offered. Nobody seemed to show interest in re-scheduling the return ticket (which could not be used due to air travel shut off due to lock down) and insisted to pay fresh tickets price (which were unreasonably high in business class). Eventually when my wife visited local air india ticketing office in India (Chandigarh) most of the announced flights were sold out.

Once again after our continuous & countless calls to Air India customer service that usually got attention after several hours of waits/holds on music each time and numerous personal visits & begging in front of their your local ticketing office staff (in sector 34, Chandigarh India) and paying hefty charges/fair-differences/taxes & what-not, we finally still felt slightly okay that after all we got scheduled to fly back on June 12th flight (AI 173).

But eventually it was to our immense disappointment when on the date of flight at Delhi airport we were told that we have been secretly downgraded to economy class WITHOUT any of their staff members giving us a slightest possible hints about this drastic change to our re-scheduled ticket. We had previously been struggling ONLY to get our family booked in same/business class as our originally scheduled ticket which got void due to lock down. Had any of the airline's staff member at the ticketing office mentioned about this such an important piece of information pertaining to the class-change, we would have NEVER gotten settled for this return flight.

It was shockingly harassing experience for my spouse with my little 3 year old son when she was told at the boarding counter that suddenly the ticket issued was NOT business class anymore. And to add to this mental torture there were no upgrades available on the spot when we decided to make our mind to pay even more money on top off already charged huge sum of money. We all were in a state of shockingly huge disappointment and went through huge mental & physical harassment for the entire return journey that my spouse & my son had to forcefully experience, given no choice (after travelling almost full day to airport by road and learning that they don’t have any choice but to travel in downgraded economy class that no one communicated to us at any point during or after the entire re-issuing ticketing process).

To add to this chain of disturbing events during this worst travel experience my son’s stroller was declared lost/missing upon arrival in SFO such that my wife had to hold him as well carry the luggage all the way to the ground transportation point that is actually a very long walk through long queues & waiting times in immigration/custom queues. And finally upon reaching home we surprisingly got call (as if it was some sort of courtesy) from air india ground staff that ""your baby stroller had been found and you would need to come back all the way back to SFO airport from where ever you are currently located and pick it up"". It was ridiculously hopeless response on delayed/missing luggage filed issues that are usually entertained & serviced via shipping in addition to appropriate compensation for the sufferings caused.

Anyway we wanted to share the entire series of issues we have faced during this frustratingly awful travel experience through air india when we had been desperately begging for help to schedule our return ticket to be able to re-unite with entire family, for many many weeks using all possible communication channels and without getting useful response. And when we finally got one by paying countless personal visits to one of your local ticketing office it led to even much bigger & disastrous mess, mental/physical torture with involuntary downgraded travel class, missing stroller & so on.

We will definitely avoid travelling air india in future."

I usually fly over 100,000 miles a year and have never experienced a flight in an aircraft that has been as poorly maintained as the one I was on. On the other hand, flight was on time and flight attendants seemed nice enough. I wonder whether the mechanical maintenance on Air India is as poor as the way they maintain the interior of their aircraft. Just in case, I will not be flying AI again. "

Where do I start? I had a confirmed flight ticket booked for 6 June 2020 from Kolkata to London and the airline cancelled the flight. However, they never notified me of the cancellation (and options available to me). The phone lines mentioned in their website are not reachable at all (I have tried multiple times on all 3 numbers they have provided). When contacted 3 days before the flight (via email), they gave me only one option to reschedule the flight but that would cost me the fare difference (guaranteed as airlines would increase prices after COVID-19 travel restrictions are relaxed). There was no option for the customer to get their money back (even partially). The email responses were a hot and miss - sometimes ignored and sometimes answered. When asked for a cancellation (based on normal cancellation rules), they made charged me a penalty fees. Why should I pay a penalty if I am willing to travel and the airline has cancelled. Finally, they agreed to cancel but not willing/able to tell me the amount that would be refunded. So both the options provided to the customers are unknown in terms of cost - a business like this should be brought to court in any civilised part of the world.

The staff is unbelievably rude, indifferent and incompetent. And goes for both ground and inflight staff. The planes makes you feel unsafe, like they might fall apart any minute, the inflight entertainment on international flights are a joke, the passenger comfort is non existent, and they are not even cheap. You can easily find other flights/airlines who will provide better everything at much better prices.
The window shade on the so called “Dreamliner”, is centrally controlled, which means on an international flight, in the daytime, you are forced to spend 8 hours in artificial darkness. Way to promote jetlag.
I will probably not travel on Air India again. There are many other airlines who takes passenger comfort, security and satisfaction way more seriously.

On Ground

Great job by DIAL (Delhi Airport) in following government guidelines. Easy step by step with most people following instructions. From arrival to check in, Air India ground staff were helpful, compassionate and understanding. All standard operating protocols were followed. So far so good.

In Air

Now the nightmare starts with the she devils - the Air India hostess’s - crude , unhelpful, unrefined etc. Many more adjectives I can go on with. 

This particular flight had lot of elderly and single mothers with young kids. The young mothers who sat on bulkhead seats were not given bassinets for the babies in spite of request. Sad part is that the air hostess’s promised to provide one but never gave one. Imagine holding your baby for 16 hours. Just cruel!

No In Flight Entertainment - what is the connection with earphones and covid. I had my iPad was able to enjoy a bit but it defies any logic not to provide something. I have not seen any advisory on it. 

Restrooms - my fellow Indians, you must practice keeping it clean. Do your part and the staff can do theirs. Don’t litter, be mindful of what you expect. The bathrooms were not sanitized every couple of hours as was told before the flight by the she devils of Air India. 

The food for the repatriation flight was put on our seats - ordinary to say the least but so much junk food. I would advice customers to pack their own food if permitted, check with the airlines. So the Air India Chef is either a duffer or has no idea how to create a menu of cold food that can last 24 hours as there was no HOT food and beverage service. Yes, covid situation is tough but there are far more creative ways of doing then just giving popcorn, KitKat, mixture mix and sandwiches that were not wrapped properly and completely dry to eat - practically inedible. 

Once we landed in New York, all the passengers got up with no regards to social distancing. Please explain this unique Indian phenomenon of taking out luggage and standing before the aircraft door is open. I typically sit for all them to leave and come out last.

Finally what has been said about Air India aircraft conditions are true. Most food trays are broken, seats are uncomfortable and decor unimaginative. No wonder you are going out of business. 

One last point, why is that we have the Indian mentality of cleaning our area and piling garbage in the galley. You were asked to put all garbage under your seat yet most people did not. As long as my space is clean I couldn’t care less about 

I do thank the Indian government for doing a heroic job of getting so many stranded Indians. Very commendable. I just wished Air India would have stepped up with this opportunity of a life time to improve their status."

"2020-05-07T09:56:42-04:00","1","review","1","ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE","summary: simply horrendous staff and customer service and ABUSE OF POWER

My friend and I made our first trip together to India. We are both Canadian students travelling abroad alone for a youth conference and were completely traumatized by our experience with Air India.

Upon arrival, our luggage was missing and did not make it to Delhi when we landed. They had provided no explanations as to why our luggages weren't delivered on time. So this is where a series of lies, deceptions, and empty promises begin! (apparently very common here).

We were told that our luggages will be ""arriving with the next flight coming in"" from Toronto>Paris>Delhi. They had re-assured us multiple times that there is nothing we can do here at the airport and that our luggage will surely be in Delhi by ""tomorrow morning"" (a lie). They also re-assured us that they would deliver our luggage to our hotels in the morning (another lie). We provided our addressed and confirmed this information multiple times. We also had to complete forms describing our travel route and provided descriptions of our luggages. So with this info from the Air India office in Indira Gandhi Airport, we left and took down the customer service number they had provided.

We were in a new country with none of our belongings and left stranded for 6 days. We called the customer service line multiple times every day with no luck. We would get a person on the line if we called earlier in the day (6-7 am) but they were still unhelpful and would not provide any updates on our luggages. They hung up on us almost every call. Without exaggeration, we made over 130 calls day/night for 6 days straight. 

We finally got more info about our luggages once we informed the staff that we were going to report them to the Canadian embassy. Air India staff had said they ""did not have enough man power to make the delivery to our hotels"" and that our luggages ""were with the delivery person"". We demanded our luggages to be delivered. Without luck or further updates, we were able to get a hold of another customer service rep so we asked him for the address of this ""delivery person"" bc we will have to go pick up the luggages on our own. We received a phone number of a random man and contacted him in order to meet up for our luggages. Once we met the man, we realized one of our luggages were missing. He was the only person to sympathize with us and tried to help us track down the other luggage by making some calls. He had told us that this is common when travelling Air India. (we literally met up with a random man and his mini van to pick up our luggages!!!! extremely disconcerting)

After another back and forth with Air India, we returned to the airport and finally picked up the other luggage (after waiting ~3 HOURS to the airport). It was a complete disaster and extremely stressful. 

Our return experience was even worse. 

As students on work trips, we did not have a lot of cash on us. They overcharged us for baggage fees (almost $800USD, which had us mortified). They would not provide any explanation as to how they make overage charges. We were asking multiple Air India staff on duty about how they got to this number (was it based on kg or was it a fixed price for all bags that were overweight?). One woman said it was by kg, I think she quoted ~500 rupees per kg or something like that. In which case it makes NO sense why we were being charged $750USD per person. I had about 8 kg over, while my fried had 11 kg of extra weight. Another staff had said they charge by bag, so any bag that is overweight will be x amount of money... 

We got our tickets via an app called Hopper. According to Hopper, we were allowed one luggage each (as well as a carry on and personal bag) and any ADDITIONAL CHECKED BAGS would be $100 CAD. So we showed our ticket and this message/policy to the Air India staff and they just would not accept it. They were persistent that we pay the ~750USD per person. We explained that we were students and asked them HOW they got to $750USD per person because no-one would provide us with a break down of this fee.

We arrived 3 hours early and they wasted ~2hours trying to generate this $750 receipt for us to pay. They were working extremely slowly and moved us from one counter to the next. There was no manager on site to help us. After this back and forth, a man finally gave me a piece of paper (a random piece of paper with his ""calculations"" written with a pencil about how much we should pay for the extra weight in each of our luggages). We COULD NOT make the payment unless we had this piece of paper. He handed this to us about 15 mins before our boarding closed. 

Once we went over to the other counter to pay this with our USD, the same guy came over and said ""it's too late, you are not going on that flight"". It was a nightmare. No explanations, no sympathy, and complete abuse of power. 

They didn’t let us on the flight, and marked our statuses as “no show”. After ongoing arguments for over 10 hours at the airport with every staff of various positions, they told us to wait for 24 hours at the airport to receive a decision informing that this issue would be resolved. Luckily we had connections to remain in the airport lounge, after waiting for a whole night at the airport, we were informed that we had to purchase new tickets.

ZERO customer service, zero satisfaction, and absolutely no humane decency

Take precautions! You're in a new country, universal airline policies won't always apply. They will simply reject whatever paper or policies you are referring and will not budge. Simply horrendous staff."

I booked my flights at November 20, 2019, planned flight for Sunday, May 10, 2020.
First three changes made to my itinerary were minor, so I didn't bother myself much.
The fourth change was a shock.
They changed my flight from Singapore to New Delhi to May 11, New Delhi to Tell Aviv
remain at My 10. How this itinerary can be made???
I asked cancellation of my ticket and refund of my payment as the itinerary CAN'T BE DONE. 
10 email go and back, they told me to call customer service, not email. But all the 
changes were made by  email, so why I suppose to call?
With no choice left, I tried to call. The Singapore number is disconnected ""temporarily"". The number in India left me online and disconnected me four time. 

Paid US$ 50 for not be able to get to a person, just automated answering.

Fore easy understanding, I will copy/paste the last change Air India made, by email. I think the person was high on alcohol or drugs and no one wanted to help me at Air India Customer Support:

I copy/paste the itinerary but it was rejected as the itinerary is in capital letters

I will lose US$1,250 on the ticket.
THIS IS AIR INDIA. Be aware when you are booking a flight that you may never see a flight or your money back.

Best wishes

We finally got a hold of them once we informed the staff that we’d report them to the Canadian embassy and had to travel 3 HOURS to the airport to pick them up. 

Our return was even worse, we were students on work trips and didn’t have much cash on us. They overcharged us for baggage fees ($800USD which had us mortified), and once we declined to pay this price, they didn’t let us on the flight, and marked our statuses as “no show”. After ongoing arguments for over 10 hours at the airport with every staff of various positions, they told us to wait for 24 hours at the airport to receive a decision informing that this issue would be resolved. Luckily we had connections to remain in the airport lounge, after waiting for a whole day at the airport, we were informed that we had to purchase new tickets, word for word “pay the price, or choose to suffer here”. Even the police weren’t able to help us, and they lied to every authority figure, even though we continuously mentioned to check the CCTV for proof (which they ignored).

Delhi, India. The World Health Organization had just declared a Pandemic for COVID-19. We arrived at Yangon Airport more than three hours before our flight. We had to wait until three hours before the flight to check in with Air India. The airport was essentially empty. One member of our party had to go through the 3rd degree about his wheel chair battery, but to be fair all the other airlines we flew also gave him the third degree about the battery. He did wind up carrying it aboard the plane, which is what he had done on most of our flights. Cost him extra $150 for luggage (20 Kilo over). There was a very understanding Indian  lady in charge of the counter. Found out later she is the 3rd generation working for Air India. She was most helpful and pleasant. She came to us in the Air India lounge to make sure all was well. She was at the gate and even on the plane to make sure everything was ok before we departed. Only 24 people on our flight. She said normally this plane is booked up 6 months in advance, but due to the COVID-19 no one is flying. We did pickup 110 people when we stopped in Gaya en-route to New Delhi.

I have been on many different airlines, and Air India is definitely one of the worst. Firstly, the flight attendants were extremely rude. I understand that their job is hard, but they had an extremely unpleasant attitude. Halfway through the flight, my entertainment screen stopped working, and when I asked the flight attendants for some help, they said “Sorry, we can’t help you fix that and we’re landing in only 4.5 hours”. I was appalled, as I had paid for the seat and they hadn’t even made an attempt to help me. While the food was being handed out, I was sleeping so the flight attendant gave me the non-vegetarian option. I am vegetarian, so I asked the flight attendant for an alternative meal, and she simply said “We can’t get any other meal”. The condition of the plane was horrible, as it seemed a million years old. It was super dirty, and the seats were not comfortable AT ALL. And also, I couldn’t book business class because there was an urgent event that I needed to go to, but if you need legroom, don’t book on economy. Overall, I had an awful experience on Air India and I will definitely never fly on this failed airline again."

So on the 18th march we drove straight to Delhi airport to see if we could fly home. Air India had 3 remaining flights on 18th going to the UK so we asked if we could be squeezed on one of the flights as our flight had been cancelled BY AIR INDIA. Air India's reply was there were no more economy seats available but plenty of 1st class to which we would be required to pay £3500 EACH extra to board. we said we we were happy to pay a little extra but £3500...really. My understanding was that if an airline cancels the flight they have a duty of care to get you on another flight especially in a crisis. 
The queue for Air Indias desk on the 18th March was full of Brits trying desperately to get home, we we were all absolutely appalled and shocked by the lack of Air Indias compassion during this difficult time and less than helpful attitude...they couldnt care less. .

Was there anything positive to say.... the answer really has to be no, other than the check in went ok...

I boarded the plane and was directed to my seat... first thing I discovered the actual seat was broken, which resulted in a difficult flight... this was followed by the entertainment control being broken and in pieces and then the actual entertainment system did not work.

Things did not improve. I asked for a drink.... what would you like I was asked.  Could I have a diet coke.. the air  steward pulled  a can out of the trolley.... it was covered in rust. He searched for another that to was covered in rust aadly he saw nothing wrong with this and was taken aback when I said no... I decided to go with a glass of water..

Part way through the flight i asked for a blanket.... the steward brought one... sadly bearing in mind Corona virus is the air,  the blanket appeared to be used and was not in a sealed packet... there was no pillows or blanket on the seats when we boarded. In fact some people had to ask for headphone as well.

The staff seem to have no interest in keeping the paying customer happy, word like ""what"", ""why"" and ""no"" were the order of the day.. the word ""please"", ""thank you"", ""your welcome""  seem to missing from their vocabulary and training..."

Two months after cancelling these tickets and promising a refund, I can confirm that they never ever intended to pay the money. Their play is as if they are about to do something, but they don't.

We had a trip booked for March 20, 2020 - April 10, 2020. Because of the Coronavirus outbreak out Visas got cancelled and all airports shut down which left us no choice but to call and cancel our trip. 

We called numerous times and we waited hours on the phone which is understandable. However, we called a few times and each time they would hang up on us so we had to call back over and over. 

On top of that, even though we could not go on our trip. They told us that we had to pay $1100 for the tickets to cancel which was almost the price of one ticket. We let them know that we thought thy it was unfair as it was not our fault and they would just hang up which prompted us to have to call again and again. 

I would not recommend this airline to anyone as they don’t care about anyone. Even when you call the people on the phone are just outright rude to you. 

Always take any other flight rather than Air India."

Customer isn't allowed to talk to manager if the issue isn't addressed","The airlines were not even willing to provide a refund during the time of Coronavirus. They just mentioned that they were doing going to refund but all they do is to charge people more during the crisis. This is a terrible airline which I will avoid at all costs. 

Their website is awful and confusing. It has very few options available. 

Their customer service is abysmal. I had to call at least 10 different numbers to find out the airlines correct customer support number, the phone number mentioned on their website doesn't work. After finally getting their number, I had to wait for 2 hours to get a proper answer. To find out the answer to my question, the representative was reading some kind of updates and mumbling, they could have at least used the hold option. My issue was not resolved completely. I requested to talk to a manager, to which I was lied to about first, the representative said they do not have a manager at all. I was shocked and asked how could there not be a manager for a business, the representative then said that the manager was not on the FLOOR. It was the most awful customer service ever."

It's a free for all so you get to your seat slowly and realize that this is one really old plane.  The seat is stained and the best one can do is wipe down everything and hope for the best.  It was a 2 hour flight and food was passed out - rice and some sauce but passable enough to eat when you're hungry.

It was worse than served in jails I feel. Wine was only Indian entry-level or less. Toilets were not very clean this time.

First you have to check your baggage so you que for over an hour because they don't have enough staff on duty.

Then you to to security where they make you stand in a sue for another 2 hours (min) because for some reason they think its necessary to check you through immigration for an internal flight, then they have delay after delay after delay waiting at the gate.

The aircraft are like flying London taxis and are dirty, overcrowded and not clean. Locals carry on too much baggage so you can never find an overhead locker anywhere your seat. When you land therefore you have to wait until the plane is empty before you can retrieved your carry-on bag as its half way foes the plane. Children are uncontrolled, alcohol flows freely and Indians like to drink! Once on the taxiway, a further delay for 40 minutes whilst they threw a couple of passengers off the aircraft, and retrieved their luggage from the hold, then eventually we took off.

Then at the counter you realise that it is Alliance Air and has nothing to do with Air India. It does not support any Air India Frequent Flier advantages. Then the printed ticket clearly says Free Meals Included, which is denied by the crew who is busy selling CCD Food products. I am clear that the alliance air lines should not either use the Air India Logo with Free Meals or honor the commitments of FF and Free Meals."

The food tray that I used did not hang properly and I also noticed other trays that were dangling precariously.  The inflight entertainment system is also pretty old and out-of-date.  The system went out a few times which required that you had to begin watching your movie from the beginning.  The controls in my seat were not properly working.

Think about a putting a small kid away from mother and father in a 20hr international flight. The seats are broken, you cannot sit straight in the seats as the leg space is taken away by some repairs at the leg space or by design. Entertainment systems won't work. Inexperienced staff at checkin who does not have a clue what happens to the luggage if if I have a connecting fleight from EWR.

First  the flight from Kathmandu will inexplicably be delayed, and then further delayed because they don't trust Nepal security. They hand check every passenger one more time on the as airfield before you climb the steps to board. 

Our flight attendant told us that Air India would hold our connecting flight (like many quality airlines do) but our connection to Sri Lanka left on time, stranding 8 of us in Delhi for an extra 10 hours.

To add fuel to the fire, once we boarded, the air hostess was rude and uncaring. When I requested her, to put an empty water bottle that I was carrying, in the bin, she refused to take it and even advised her colleague not to touch it.

We hoped that as part of Star alliance we’d be put on a BA flight or Virgin but we can now see why there was plenty of seats on Air India business class. The only good thing was the very ample leg room and amenities bag with Herbal products.  

This Flight hadn’t been cleaned properly When we got on our tables were covered in dirty marks and we were told by a very grumpy  member of staff that we could clean our tables ourselves if we wanted to (in business class). Not a way to treat a customer who has save up for a bit more comfort. 
No drink served for 2 hours, food served 4 hours into flight. Food was edible but not the same as other Business Class standard. Very disappointed as staff were totally disinterested in providing good service to all travellers. One staff member allowed us all to clear our own tables, there were trays all over the cabin left uncleared. One passenger asked for a Bloody Mary and got just tomato juice and had to ask again for the vodka. We asked for champagne it was still warm 2 hrs into the flight and only received one glass unless we asked for top up.

Staff spent most of the time in the galley and if you appeared you were told to go back to your seats. Another passenger did not take his tray up but after 45 mins actually held it out for her to take away. Two of the screen seats had to be reset (that took 30 mins to get someone to do it).

Toilets okay but a bit smelly but at least clean. Bits of tissue left here and there. 

Food before landing was very basic too. I remember  a very dry sponge and a samosa, but got a cup of tea at least.  Many passengers asked when beverages would be served. In 8 hr flight tea came round once. 

There was no service with a smile or apology. Have travelled business  to and from Mumbai before and was a much better,  more professional, good  service by mature staff. On that flight Food also much better served with mithai and chocolate from Mumbai. I was told when I asked “it’s a different route ma’am”. The cabin was not completely full on this occasion and it could have been a nicer experience with a few changes.

Sadly from our experience and 5 other passengers who spoke to us we would not recommend this from flight Delhi to London."

Morning flight 9:30am did not provide any breakfast and served snack of peanuts 2hours into flight. Main meal was served later and before arriving cold cheese roll.

My wife had had to see a doctor earlier in our holiday due to the usual deli belly but felt she would be able to make the flight. Whilst we were waiting in T3 Delhi Airport to drop our bags the heat was such that my wife feinted in the queue. After a lot of shouting someone from Air India did bring a chair for her to sit down (the only positive). I asked if they could help me contact our emergency travel agent line at which point the guy from Air India walked off never to be seen again. I managed to contact my agent who booked us into an airport hotel so she could recover. My wife was still suffering badly and was partly slumped over our suitcases. It took over another hour to get so one in the airport to get me a wheelchair and assist me to get out if the terminal to the hotel. At no point did anyone from Delhi Airport or Air India look for a first aid person to help. All Air India did was keep pushing me off to other people. It was only after a long and heated talk to the information desk did someone get me some help. I am disgusted by this whole episode and will never be taking another trip to India after this. We had loved the place up until then but the lack of assistance to someone clearly suffering was unacceptable in this day & age

On an earlier connected Air India flight, where the entertainment system was not broken, it was slow and not easy to navigate. 
The food offered was unexciting; a breakfast sandwich comprised two thick slices of white bread with no discernible filling!
At least the relevant cabin crew member was charming; seemingly embarrassed about the state of the aircraft and her inability to make things better. She did provide copious cushions to help with the broken seat with springs sticking through. Not helped that the flight was delayed - not unusual with Air India I am told. I have flown to India three times in the last twelve months and also taken internal flights- all with other Airlines.

Years ago I vowed never to travel with Air India again ( a cancelled flight after waiting in the plane on the runway for several hours)  but now that Jet Airways has gone broke, Air India has a monopoly on the Mumbai to Bhuj route. To add insult to injury, we were shoved onto a subsidiary airline of Air India, a propeller driven small plane with no real customer service. Second rate quality but Air India charges premium prices for this route. Over A$1000 return for 2 people ! After spending 2 days in Bhuj, we heard of at least two other couples who has missed the early morning flight - which didn't surprise us. If Air India doesn't increase their number of desk staff at early morning check in, then their customers will have to endure the stress of continued bad customer service.

Overall, the punctuality, service and product were poor quality. First, all flights were delayed. Each delay was anywhere from 1 hour to 4 hours with no explanation or compensation. Worse of all, a 4 hour domestic delay  meant that I would have arrived at my destination, had my meeting, had a meal and could have settled in. Instead I sat in an airport waiting and waiting. Second, the service is terrible. Business class passengers are treated no better than any other passenger. There is no premium service at check in, no better attention to details, no above and beyond service to premium passengers. The lounges are either non-existent or very basic. No amenities are provided. Arrival at the gate is chaos and again no acknowledge or assistance provided to premium passengers. The in-flight service was so basic (no better than economy), the food was identical to economy, and the seats were worn out and not always comfortable. There was no attention provided by crew to premium passengers . Once food was served (in economy trays and dishes) and cleaned up, crew were never around. Finally, while the bags were tagged as premium bags, the bags arrived at all airports long after many economy bags arrived (so why tag the bags if there is no attention to this detail?). Finally, the product - the hard and soft product of AI is very very poor. 
It is no wonder the airline is hemorrhaging and losing passengers and support. Why would anyone fly AI when there are so many better airlines out there. Vistara for one!

On the flight from Singapore to Delhi, they offered complimentary beverages (including alcoholic beverages) to start with along with munchies. The portions were good and the selection was good too. It was a night flight so they included dinner which was fantastic. Rice with a paneer curry and a kheer for dessert. That was rounded off by a tea/coffee.

To add insult to injury no food, hotel or taxi was provided for the missed flight. And it literally took a staff member 10-15 minutes per passenger to re-book flights as Air India uses a 20 year old computer system. 

An absolute disgrace of an airline. I had a terrible experience with them about 12 years ago and promised never to fly. I made the mistake of finally flying with them again because they have a monopoly on this route. And of course this nightmare happened. Air India is a complete disgrace to the aviation industry and an insult to the nation of India."

I had paid Rs. 1000 & pre-booked a seat on the first row of the Economy cabin & my e-boarding pass after online check in also showed the correct seat number. But after dropping off bag at the airport counter when they gave me a printed boarding pass my seat was changed without even informing me. I fought so much at the boarding gate but they refused to do anything & were least bothered. 
After boarding we were made to sit in the aircraft for almost 1 hour but no information what was happening & why the delay..??   
Even during flight, the cabin temperature was very cold but the captain did not change the temperature even though 3-4 requests were made. The purser then gave me blanket which was the only good experience in this flight.  
Travelling on this flight was like a punishment & I was just waiting to reach my destination at the earliest. 
The food served was average but the way inflight crew did the service was also brash as if they were forced to do so. 
It is such a shame to write all this about our own national airline which really needs to improve on all fronts. 
Never consider this airline unless you have no other choice..!!"

But when I was seated on the plane going to  Singapore an official from Singapore Airline boarded the plane and told me my luggage was still in Goa.  It had not even left the Goa airport.

"2020-02-15T10:06:39-05:00","1","review","8","Walk or find an alternate way","OK where do I begin. Lets start with departure... I got on the plane which looked a little under maintained to put it mildly. The seats looked like they had cushion covers that hadn't been cleaned since the 90's? The head rests didn't have any covers and they looked dirty. I immediately became worried, we took a closer look and found wrappers in the seat back pockets, crumbs on the floor from the previous flight(s) and debris all around looking like there has been no attempt to clean the seating areas in a while. The table looked so dirty that we took the decision that it would be unsanitary to eat in the plane, therefore consumed nothing for 9 hours, as if the customer facing area is this bad, I couldn't begin to imagine the state of the non customer facing areas (kitchen).
We took our seats and as the doors closed the pilot announced that we were now delayed for departure by 90 minutes (all because they were tardy getting people onto the plane). During the delay there was no attempt to make us comfortable - no offer of water or any checks by the crew for that matter.
Time to take off (thank you Heathrow for finding us an earlier slot - hence the delay was only 50 minutes) as the plane left the tarmac, my wife who was sat in the window seat was soaked as water started dripping from the vents. I tried shielding her but I got the same (I sent this feedback to Air India and haven't had any response in 5 working days). The host told us there's nothing he could do about the water and that it was condensation as the heating was on in the plane and we should regard it as ""Holy Water"" - how ridiculous! 2 hours into the flight I got up to use the restroom, there was a wet floor to greet me and a wet seat (with a yellow liquid -  you do the math) had I wanted to sit down. I asked the host if they had cleaned or checked the toilets and they advised it's not their job.
Luckily my tiredness had taken a hold and I slept a considerable amount of the journey. The second serving of food however woke me as the smell overpowered the cabin... FISH! On a plane in a confined space. I was left baffled. The positive I have to share is that I got to my destination! 
For my return journey I was lucky (or not) to be sat on the exit aisle seat. Check In was another experience as the guys at the counter wanted me to pay them in cash only to let my bag through as it breached their 23kg per bag policy (total allowance of 46 kg is only allowed if split between 2, my total was 30kg so I was in breach - again ridiculous!). Departure was delayed by 105 minutes.
The seats were the same condition as the previous flight, the headrests did have covers however these were stained (filthy unwashed or unchanged!) The side pocket had a few wrappers. We were sat in eye shot of the lavatories and again these were not cleaned by the airline during the journey. The joke is that the hosts actually used the bins in the lavatories to dispose of drink cartons and glasses. There was water on the floor outside the lavatory - a trip hazard and smell, and someone thought it would be best to just put some hand towels down on it, which were kicked off into the lavatory later. I refused to eat or drink as I knew the table wasn't sanitised and I would have hated to have to visited the lavatory.
So even if it is a longer journey to change somewhere else, take that option! Saving time was my priority however flying with Air India is not ever going to be an option again."

Staff were rude and very unhelpful throughout all flights. Entertainment system did not work. Plane very dated and toilets were disgusting like they haven't been cleaned in a very long time. They also do not cater for people with allergies. My friend has a severe nut allergy which she informed the airline prior to travel adn also when we boarded... There response 'you and your friends need to get off you cannot travel'. She eventually had to play down her allergy In order to stay on the plane and spent the flight in the toilet wearing a mask so as not to inhale the copious amounts of peanuts that were given out to other passengers. There  were also Other passengers with the same allergy but the staff did not seem to understand or care about the severity of this. Allergies are very common these days and other airlines I've traveled with make adjustments to ensure the safety of their passengers but this was not the case with Air India. I would definitely not recommend them... Worst airline I've ever experienced."

I contacted them using the (business and first class!) telephone helpline, where I was forced to wait in a queue for over 2 hours only to be told I must submit my claim via the feedback section of the website.

This I did on 2 occasions and both times the request was ""acknowledged"" but nothing has happened since (the last entry was on 24th August 2019).

I have also contacted my travel agent and they have also requested a refund from Air India on at least 5 separate occasions.

To date, Air India refuse to either refund the difference between ticket classes or even engage with me (or my travel agent) in any meaningful way and now even after 7 months they continue to ignore me!

I am disgusted with this airline and their so called customer service; needless to say, I will NEVER be flying with Air India again and would encourage others to proceed with great caution.

When booking the flight, so time ago, it was due to depart at 18.30 and touchdown at 20.10, a scheduled flying time of one hour and forty minutes.

On the day of our departure we received a message from Air India advising that the flight had been rescheduled to 18.50 with a later arrival time of 20.30.

At Dabolim Airport, having endured one of the longest and slowest check ins, at the desk we were informed of another slight delay till 19.00.

The aircraft actually pushed back from the terminal at 19.55. The aircraft was finally airborne at 20.05.

We were informed that the flight time would be 1 hour. The Captain did apologise for the delay and advised that is was as result of a delay to the incoming flight from Mumbai. He also informed passengers that the temperature in the cabin was maintained at 23 degrees, it certainly did not feel like that as it was rather chilly on board.

Although the seats were not the most comfortable, ok for the length of this flight, the legroom was rather good.

During the flight we were served a snack, consisting of a finger sized coleslaw sandwich and a juice drink. Thankfully a small sachet of ketchup was also provided which gave the sandwich some flavour.

We actually landed in Mumbai at 21.05 which was 35 minutes later than scheduled.

Amazed that the Airline scheduled one hour and 40 for this flight, which is twice the normal flight of 50 minutes and still arrive 35 minutes late.

For those reads interested in types of aircraft, this one was an A321."

First of all if you check anytime at the Terminal for baggage check in, all other counters of other Airlines are operational but in case of Air India only a couple of counters are operational and that's why a big chaos of long waiting for your turn. Also they are very slow and lethargic at attending to the passengers. If you complain it goes unheard and only a barrage of excuses. 

Same goes for the Security at Air India. There are huge lines running in rows as if you are standing in queue to visit a holy shrine 😄!! They are super slow and you are just looking at your watch not to miss your flight if you are a bit late which is very much possible given the state of Mumbai traffic. 

Now the flight was scheduled at about 9 pm but consistent delays without any appropriate reason given by the personnel made us spend almost the whole evening at the Airport praying for the flight to be announced. It finally took off at about 11pm and we reached the city after 1am. No apologies whatsoever to be expected. 

The food served on the Air India flight is PATHETIC to say the least. It's not cooked fully and no salt... Lacks complete taste and we pay for it compulsorily.

Some info about Air a India:  They are owned by the Indian Government and are losing money.  The Government is desperately trying to sell it off.

Here’s a summary of my return flight:

Flight out (Cph to Delhi):

Called to gate 1.5hours before departure, and was then left at the gate for hours, as the flight was an hour delayed.

The plane is a Dreamliner, but it’s really old and is very tired and tatty.  It’s also very dirty.  They have fold out tables and there was thick brown dirt in the fold of the table.

The toilet closest to my seat stank at the start of the journey.  It smelt like someone had repeatedly urinated all over the floor and then it had been left to dry for a few days.

The inflight entertainment didn’t work.  It seems you’ve got a 50/50 chance on whether this works or not.

The curry provided was ok.  The breakfast was a very hard and dry muffin cake (no one ate it) and and equally dry croissant with butter.

When we were offered drinks, I asked for a Diet Coke, the person next to me asked for milk and another person asked for wine.  We were told no to all and advised that they only had juice and water left (we were one of the first in economy to be served, so I guess they just hadn’t stocked up).

The staff are very blunt.  

Return flight (Delhi to Cph):

I had to queue well over an hour to check in (you can’t check in online).

It then took well over an hour to get through security (lots of people pushing in the queue too).  This isn’t Air India’s fault, but I thought I’d let you know, so you don’t miss your flight.  The security queue is separate for men and women.

The flight was delayed 1.5 hours.

This time the inflight entertainment screen worked, but the socket for plugging the headphones was missing, so no sound.  The flight information showing on the screen was incorrect - it was showing that we departed 30 minutes ago, when we’d actually been flying for a few hours.

The first meal we received was a frozen croissant with ketchup (??!!).

The second meal was a curry, but for some reason everyone else got yogurt with their meal, but I didn’t.

This time the toilets smelt like they had been cleaned.

For a fair part of the flight I had water from the air conditioning unit dripping on my head.  Yikes!

Additional info: About two weeks before your flight, Air India email you to ask if you would like to bid on upgrading to business class (my flights were, minimum 450 USD for flight out and minimum 350 USD for return flight).  I don’t know how much better business class would be, as it’s the same plane.  You can only bid up to 2 days before your flight."

Returned AI 302 Delhi to Sydney Business Class. The flights were on time . 
We found our flights extremely comfortable and pleasant in all areas. The service was impeccable, the food was presented in an orderly fashion and was tasty and enjoyable. The staff was very attentive and very helpful. We cannot fault anything or anybody during any of these flights. All of them did their very best to attend and please everybody and interact. 
We enjoyed our flights this time very much, unlike last January 2020, which was a disaster in most respects. Air India has definitely improved tremendously since then. 
We had 3 smooth flights (had some bumps now and again)  most of the way going and coming and I congratulate the Pilots for taking us safely  and landing the planes very smoothly onto each  runway.
The only negative thing that I have to say, is that the material for the seats could be improved. they were not so comfortable to sit in or sleep on, some material/leather more softer and smoother would have made all the difference. maybe next time when I fly to India on a holiday, i'd find a more softer  material used for the seats. Another negative aspect was that the bathroom could have some pull out tumblers to fill with water to wash the mouth.
I sincerely hope that Air India will live on forever and carry on their wonderful service that they gave us in January 2020.

I still went out of the security and approached the check in counter for permission to go out of the terminal to cancel my ticket. The manager on duty persuaded me not to do so as the flight will leave shortly. I again passed the security. But was told that the flight is not getting clearance to fly to New Delhi. Gradually the flight kept on getting delayed. Nobody told us that we could have snacks while waiting. On asking Harpreet, I was told that the snacks are already over and nothing can be done. His attitude was of indifference. Finally we boarded the flight around 1300Hrs. But it still did not take off. At about 1400 Hrs everybody started shouting as there was no manager available to explain as to what was happening. At this moment as the flight was not taking off, I was trying to purchase a ticket on Indigo leaving around 1500Hrs online. Because of poor internet inside the aircraft the booking was not completing. I told Mr Harpreet about this. He said he could help and called up the Indigo counter to check whether they had tickets available. He confirmed that he has got two tickets blocked for us and sent a person with us to take us there. I did not want to leave the flight but since he confirmed that the seats are there on the flight, we went to the Indigo counter outside the terminal. But were shocked to know that there were no tickets available. I asked the person who had accompanied us to make us speak with Mr Harpreet. Mr Harpreet flatly refused to come or help us in any way or speak with us. 
Mr Mehta the Station Manager who came to aircraft around 1340 Hrs was most unprofessional. He was speaking rudely with everyone. He had no command over the situation. He refused to help us in anyway and was Rude to us as if we do not exist. If he had all the information and had passed on the correct information to the passengers on time then many of us would have made alternate arrangements.
We were travelling from London on holidays and flue with Air India. In the future we will never fly with Air India. Losing a day affected our short holiday in Mysore and we could not see it completely in the time left.
We had to pay for the hotel booking in Mysore (Radisson Blue)  Rs 9900 plus 23.9% taxes and had to pay for our stay back in Chandigarh ( Hotel Hyatt) as well which was Rs 7000 plus taxes, as Mr Mehta said he could not speak with us. Even the lady who was at the counter for the cancellation of the tickets acted inhumanly and acted shamelessly. She refused to call any senior manager who could speak to us to resolve the grievance. Really shameful."

Very lackadaisical.  Air India is the government carrier and the government is trying to sell it, but can't find a buyer, perhaps because they're been running it at a deficit for years and a buyer has to assume the debt.  Investers understandably say, 'No thanks' and would prefer to just buy airplanes.

The good side:  their luggage allotment is higher than other airlines, so if you have excess baggage, you might prefer Air India to other Indian carriers."

There was no audio or headsets, even though the Airbus A321 is equipped for same. There was no bottled water. There was no vanity kit. The Discover India magazine was fine. Magazines were offered. My seat [at least] did not have a copy of Shubh Yatra, the airline’s inflight magazine. There was a choice of four breakfasts, my omelet morphing into closer to a hard boiled/baked little square. The fruit was fresh; the java, weak but that is the bane of coffee in southeast Asia. Blankets were offered if you wanted to try to sleep. Other than a larger seat, it seems hard to justify the extra expense."

My husband and I Checked in at the counter and my carry on was slightly overweight. We asked if we paid to upgrade to business class could we take our carry on as we did all the other legs of our journey (business class and including in Mumbai yesterday). They said yes, so we paid to upgrade. After we paid for business class they told us we still had to pay for the extra 2 kg or so ($50 CAD). We were too frustrated to argue so we paid). They then gave us a voucher to use the Star Alliance lounge (assumes)that was standard when in business or as a Gold member. Guess it goes to show you can’t expect the same level of service across carriers and even same carrier in a different city. Also, although the service in business in the plane is quite nice, the interior is old and worn looking and the boarding process is chaotic/non sensical in the way the board (business class not called first).

While trying to change ticket dates, I was on hold with Air India Customer Service for 7 hours. And I am not exaggerating. The Customer Service employees sounded like they were working on a loud, jammed trading floor. I could barely hear the employee trying to help me. Then we repeatedly got cut off and, of course, I had to start from scratch each time. You can never get the same Customer Service employee twice. And I rarely got the same answer to my questions more than once. When finally I was able to make the change I needed, Customer Service sent me a link for payment that never worked over the course of two days, so my date change did not go through. I was then forced to go through a US travel agency at the last moment that overcharged me and screwed up my connecting flight, forcing me to purchase an extra ticket to make my travel plans work.

And this happened twice, once from New Delhi - Varanasi, and again from Varanasi to Khajuraho, both times on Air India within the same week, so it took 4 hours, not counting check-in time, for a 1-hour flight.   

In short, we spent 3 times as long waiting as the actual flying time.  The flight itself was fine, but the delay and lack of information - no explanation or when the flight would actually leave - prompts this review.  A 3-hour delay for a short flight is bad in itself and you can excuse the occasional delay - but twice?  In the same week?

had my tickets booked to fly from Cochin to Bangalore 8months prior. 2 days before the flying day, I received notification saying the flight I booked is cancelled due to technical issues.

 so I called them with my concern hoping to get it rescheduled to another flight on the same day. 
first they denied saying they are helpless because another direct flight is fully booked on their economy class and they refuse to upgrade me to business class like any other airline would have done. 
so I offered to pay some extra for the business seats since I have already paid for the economy. but they refused and asked me for full payment for an issue that didn't caused from my end.  
After some more arguing they found a connection flight route which takes 13hrs( direct flight only takes 1hr 20mins).
 Since I have to catch another flight to Canada via frankfurt, I found it not feasible. At this point I have been on the phone with the senior agent for almost 2hrs.

 only help they offered until this point is that they will refund me without any cancellation fees and I am responsible to find my own way to get to Bangalore. so I asked for a written cancellation confirmation, stating all their verbal agreement since I do not trust anything they say over the phone. JUST WAIT, THE WORST IS YET TO COME. the so called senior agent put my call on hold to discuss to somebody and came back after 10mins that they don't have authorization to send me a confirmation about the cancellation. before I can say another word, this SENIOR guy just hung up on me. 

I called again and talked to a junior agent and I requested to talk to the senior multiple times. bit he refused to talk to me and I have no confirmation that they will even refund me.

There was no information provided to us about the delays or where the plane was that we were to board.  We were stuck in the airport - not allowed to leave - for over SIX hours.  There were no customer service agents, or any AI employees for that matter, past security to speak to.  We had security agents call the Air India desk multiple times for over half an hour and nobody would come to talk to us.  The flight actually disappeared from the status board without any information available and no announcements.  Finally security allowed one person from our party to cross back over security to go to the Air India desk since they wouldn't come to us.  The plane arrived shortly after, but the agent that our friend spoke to was not helpful or apologetic.  The gate information that finally came up on the status board was incorrect, then we were directed to another incorrect gate.  The Air India employee that finally appeared was very rude and unhelpful.  

There was more delays once we boarded the plane.  The food was disgusting (dry white bread sandwhich, but I couldn't tell you what was on it, other than a few whisps of shredded cucumber).  The seats were incredibly uncomfortable.  

When we finally arrived at our destination and were looking to leave a complaint, the Air India supervisor acted nice, but the only option that he would give us was to leave feedback on their website...  The feedback portion of their website was conveniently very slow and would crash if it actually loaded at all."

TV wasnt working and when all the passengers continuously asked for assistance, they retreated into their little cabin and hardly came out. My dad asked to check on his TV since he is not familiar with technology and has traveled for the first time- they just pressed few buttons and told him his unit isn’t working and left. 

I had my parents tray stacked on my seat since my mother needed to used the washroom and a male attendant actually told me off for it - stating that all that rubbish wouldn’t fit in his compartment. What? You could be polite while telling me that.

Always late and no regard for their customers.","I flew Air India with my girlfriend to Hyderabad with plans to catch a sleeper bus to Hampi for her sister’s wedding.  We had ample time between our scheduled landing time (approx. 8pm) and bus departure (11:30pm).  Our first flight from Udaipur to Mumbai was late, as normal with this airline.  We also learned that our connection from Mumbai was delayed from 6:50 until 8:45, but the flight didn’t even board until 9:15.  We were going to make different travel plans from Mumbai but after being reassured continuously by all of the staff that we would make it, we decided to board the flight.  We didn’t take off until closer to 10:30 and needless to say, we missed the bus that we had booked and are going to miss her sisters wedding this morning as there is no other transportation.  It took us about two hours to speak to a supervisor to try and work something out and he was unwilling to do anything or even to disclose the reason our flight was so late until we told him he is legally obligated. His response was “weather”. It’s beautiful outside and no other airline had any delays.  

My flight into India was also with AI and was extremely late and caused me to miss a bus from Delhi to Rishikesh.  Extremely unreliable and terrible customer service. No sense of accountability at all and no regard for their customers.  If you value your time and travel plans at all, I strongly recommend you look elsewhere, even if the price is more.  Their terrible service cost us about $400, and more importantly the opportunity to attend an important family event.  Beware!!!!"

They customer service representatives do not have any idea about what information they are providing. They don't even know if the passengers have to get off the plane or stay inside when there is a layover. We spoke with Aditya and he told us to speak with the flight attendants regarding this. We booked a business class Chicago to Hyderabad and we get this type of customer service after paying thousands of dollars. This guy absolutely has no idea what he was talking about and when we asked him to transfer the call to a supervisor, he simply said supervisor is busy and when we insisted, he put the call on hold and after 20 minutes the call got disconnected. Really? This is how you guys train your employees? I will never book an Air India flight again in my life and I strongly do not recommend anybody else do it either. We haven’t boarded the flight yet and the experience so far has been so pathetic. No wonder why everybody says do not book an Air India flight. I bet if you take out a survey and ask people about their experience with Air India, 9/10 people will recommend you to not to take Air India. The least you can do is to train your customer service representatives properly so that people will, at least, have something good to talk about your airlines.

My dad had to fly to India from UK on the next flight due to his mother passing away. And unfortunately the flight was delayed by 5 hours which is not ideal in a situation like this. Overcoming this problem, my dad arrived early hours in the morning in Amritsar Airport to realise that his baggage has not arrived. So the first thing my dad done was report this to Air India Baggage desk and received the PIR report and mentioned to call back on the number provided for updates and they would hopefully retrieve the lost bag and get it delivered to the desired address in India.

After calling every 2 days to this number which was Air India Baggage desk in Amritsar Airport, they would just say the baggage still have been recovered and to hold on and wait. I asked about the compensation which they should give if the baggage has been lost for more than 48 hours, in which they replied that this cannot be done as I still have my cabin luggage. So my dad had to buy new clothes etc. 

It has now been 3 weeks and again I've been ringing to find out what's going on with my  dads baggage and if they found out where it is. They stated, they've located the bag and that it never boarded the flight, so they will get it on a flight and deliver it the next day. We waited 2 days and still we have not received the bag. I rang back, and the lady and man on the phone at Amritsar Airport were being really sarcastic and laughing at the way I was speaking as my Punjabi language is not very good, which I don't appreciate after waiting 3 weeks for a lost baggage. They said either come and collect it or we will deliver it, I said deliver the baggage as we have spoke about many times on the phone. And I mentioned I would like to put a claim towards this as its been 3 weeks without a bag and still currently not received the bag. They mentioned I cannot do this as they have found my dads bag. And insisted that if I want to claim go to London and do it, we won't do it here. So no one from Air India wants to take responsibility for a baggage lost for 3 weeks.

Every time I spoke or try get a claim for this 3 week delay of baggage from Air India, I get shoved to the side and get excuses to why they cannot pay out for this. Imagine going on holiday without any baggage, how much loss has my dad had compared to how much Air India made on his flight to India is outrageous!

Never will I fly or let my family fly with Air India, worst ever interaction and experience I've had with an Airline. Treated so poorly and unacceptable for them to be making money of people who are unable to make claims or even make reviews like I am now!

If anyone reads this, I urge you to think 100 times before booking a flight with Air India, you're better off paying bit extra and fly with anyone else besides them. Never have been treated well with Air India!"

No communication from the crew. I was really hopeful as i'd read they had a dreamliner. However, once on board i realised that the seats were really old and not well cusioned, It made for a really uncomfortable flight. To make it worse i paid to secure an exit seat, but the on board entertainment was not working so not a lot to do on a day flight. I would avoid if you have an alternative."

While both of these are true, the inflight entertainment (the IFE system), did not work for any of us both onward and return, thus making the 19 hours in flight a bad overall experience. The touch screens did not react to touch and the remote in the seat was broken (refer to photos). The worst part was that there was no apology of any kind from the Stewardess. Rather the Stewardess silently disappeared and never came back. Any time we reminded we were told that it would be reset and the re-set did not work. The worst part was that we could not switch off the reading light as the remote did not work. Neither could we call the stewardess as the calling monitor did not work either. 

It is amazing how Air India can get away with broken equipment of this kind."

For nearly a decade, British Airways have been the only regular airline offering direct return flights from London to Bangalore. When using BA, I used to feel like a second grade citizen with their pathetic service, but as they maintained a relative monopoly on this route I really had no choice. 
I was very pleased to see another option with Air India available, so I booked (nearly 10 months in advance) for the family to travel (Dec 20 to Jan 4) return journey spending over £2600 (2 adults 2 children). Flew direct to Bangalore, and via Delhi back to London to maximise time spent in India. 
I was glad I paid £50 extra for seats on the return journey, a day before we flew. More details later in the review below:
- Leg-space was better than any airline for economy seats
- Food: 3 out of 4 meals were really good, and the 4th comparable to most European airlines (in terms of flavour/taste and quality for an Asian person)
- Service & Entertainment: Hot and Cold 
(a) London to Bangalore - the older cabin-crew lacked customer service skills, and my entertainment system was broken
(b) Bangalore to Delhi - flight delayed by 20 mins, but there were constant updates, and the flight was boarded in an efficient manner. No entertainment on board 
(c) Delhi to London - The ground staff in Delhi couldn't get the plane boarded in an orderly manner, and seemed clueless. The younger cabin-crew who were courteous and efficient. BUT, my entertainment system was not working again!
- Point to Note: if you would like your family to sit together, and don't manage to bag the ""free seats"", I would strongly recommend buying seats in advance. There were families with small children who were aghast that they were seated individually from their young children, and had to request passengers to swap. While I empathize with the families, this is now becoming a common practice among most airlines."

Ten minutes before take off, they cancel the flight because they dont have enough passengers lol. Then we stand in line for one hour while the untrained and incompetent employees try to print a one page cancellation slip, finally theygive a botched document that I am still chasing after at air india offices to get a 'round seal' lol. 

Do not use air india even if they give free tickets. Easily the worst run, most unethical and incompetent airline in the world. Finally with a Rs 30000 air ticket in my pocket, our family rushes to the railway station, to get a standing space only train to Kochi. 

Air India? a trashpile airline that should be dissolved, privatized, and these lazy lazy employees fired, starting with the CEO.

You should stick to running a bullockcart service, running an airline is way out of your depth. 

In future I will walk or swim or take a bus but AIR INDIA NEVER.

Looking forward to the wonderful daywhen this trashy airline is sold off to capable leaders, and fresh and honest and intelligent staff hired.

Boarding went smoothly and the 10:35 p.m. flight departed and arrived on time. Half the seats in our cabin remained empty, so the flight attendant was quite attentive during our four hours in the air. When dinner was prepared to be served, spicy aromas filled the air and the strong odor settled into my clothes. I had eaten earlier at our hotel so opted to forego a meal. My husband considered his curry dish to be average at best.

The plane had the old, standard recliner seats that did not go back far and were rather uncomfortable. I found it impossible to sleep. The cabin appeared rundown and in desperate need of an update. The seat pockets in front of me were crammed with newspapers and other items left behind by previous passengers. I found this ambiance unsettling and was delighted to get off after we landed in New Delhi."

The flights were good, especially the 787 dreamliner from COK to DXB, but AI has disappointed us in terms of overall passenger handling and baggage management.

They didnt mention anywhere that i have to do a self transfer at COK and i have reiterated before booking through the call centre and what they told me is that once you handover the baggage at TRV, you will receive it at DXB.

Contrary to this, the check in agent at TRV told me through check in is not possible and i have to collect my baggage at COK and check in again for the next flight. Additionally, i had checked in online for both sectors and selected seats, but they had deleted my COK - DXB check in record from the system at TRV, apparently due to some system related issues. (thats what they told me). As a result i lost my preassigned seats chosen at the check in time and due to this reason, my special meal request was also not served.

I understand that these flights were from two different terminals at COK but that doesn't look like a valid reason because these two terminals are adjacent to each other and i have seen AI providing through check in at DEL though the terminals are 7-8 kms apart.

The check in staff at both TRV and COK doesn't look experienced and they were unable to provide me a valid justification for both these problems. Moreover I experienced a no care attitude from them as if they have no responsibility towards the customer.

Altogether a bit disappointing experience and i suggest to consider these aspects if you are travelling this sector, especially if you are travelling with family and luggage.I am also a bit sad because even after coming with a really good flight schedule how the mismanagement at operations level is creating unhappy customers and eventual loss of business"

On this flight from Mumbai to Newark, we faced consistent problems with TV and air conditioner. The temperate kept fluctuating and it was constant cycle of hot and cold air. Most of the TV units were not working and we were neither able to sleep or watch anything for 15+ hour flight. Apparently, it was known problem and technical crew cleared the flight as AC and TV functioning doesn’t impact air worthiness of the flight. The seats were in pathetic conditions. In my seat they didn’t have headphone jack and in some seats the frames and screws were coming off. During check-in we had to stand-in for 2 hours as they were short staffed and they have checked in parents and kids separately."

"2020-01-03T05:49:15-05:00","1","review","1","Some flights are delightful experiences. This was the exact opposite.","I recently flew from Mumbai to London (Heathrow) and courtesy of Air India, this was probably the worst flight of my life so far. The flight was delayed to begin with, as was our previous flight in the opposite direction. Following a near 2 hour delay, we eventually set off in what was categorically the least comfortable flight I’ve ever had the displeasure of enduring. 

The seats had little to no cushioning between my back and the structure of the seat and the head rest is placed at an angle that forces you to be hunched over, which caused serious discomfort for the 10 hour flight. At the start of the flight I used my jumper as a pillow to try and combat this, however the temperature of the cabin was then turned down so low that I practically froze to my seat. Hence, I put my jumper back on and covered myself with the provided blanket, although this did very little to battle the excessive cold. I wondered if I had a fever or something similar, until I looked around and saw nearly every other passenger in the same position as me. 

I’ve since had to have the problems with my back fixed by an osteopath (yes, it really was that bad) which completely undermines my buying the cheapest flight available to save money (as most of us do when flying long distances around the world).

Whilst some of the staff on board were perfectly friendly, others were less welcoming and we were made to feel quite uncomfortable at times. Sitting as a family of 4 we were asked to move around to accommodate other passengers despite previously booking seats which we had to pay for and eventually settled to find that (as had been the case on our previous flight from London to Mumbai), the in-flight entertainment system did not work; a recurrent theme with Air India I’m told. The crew tried to restart the system, which then caused all of the reading lights in the cabin to turn on in my section of the cabin to turn on (perhaps unrelated) which woke up many of the passengers. For some reason, this was unique to our part of the cabin though and was not rectified which made it even more difficult to sleep on the already uncomfortable flight - striking off both of the key time killers (sleep and films) for the long-haul flight. 

We all know airplane food is infamous for poor quality, however luckily in this day and age, there are plenty of airlines that offer a perfectly okay (perhaps even good!) meal whilst airborne [heads up Emirates]. Air India is not one of them. The food was once again unappealing (despite my personal love for Indian cuisine) and refreshments were offered so infrequently that you would have to get up if you wanted anything. For some bizarre reason, Air India also gives out water in 200ml containers, meaning that you get no more than 3 sips of water per bottle, with the crew doing their best to give you as few bottles as possible when you ask - I can only assume to sadistically ensure you leave the plane with a headache as well as a bad back.  Not only for the inconvenience, but also from an environmental perspective (plastic waste - little to none of which is recycled I assume), I thought this was a bad practice.

Saying all of this though, it would be unfair not mention how Air India does compete with other airlines. Of course you also get all the added free bonuses of long flights with Air India - crying babies, unclean bathrooms, permanent noise in the cabin, etc - though, to be fair, some of these factors are out of their control. This being said, all of these factors contributed to my arriving on home soil in a sore, frustrated and delirious state.

I don’t consider myself a fussy passenger, nor would I say that I’m particularly precious when it comes to food, sleeping arrangements, service in hospitality, etc; however I do think that Air India seriously missed the mark on this one. Maybe this was an isolated occasion, and to the pilots (who got us there in one piece) and those staff who did try to make all their passengers more comfortable throughout the flight I apologise for such a scalding review, but equally I would say that my account of my experience is fair and honest. 

India is a beautiful country with a hugely diverse culture and I can not recommend it enough as a destination for travels or simply a break when your normal routine begins to feel mundane. There’s so much to do, see, taste, discuss, learn, etc and I would highly recommend going there. But if you do choose to go, please make absolutely sure that you do not fly with Air India."

Beverage is served only once in a >14 he flight and tea n coffee only with meals. No snacks served. If we wanted to get water or juice etc in between by going towards the pantry, one air hostess treated us as intruder n made the passengers feel guilty even for asking.

The call button is useless because no one comes even after calling 10 times at least. What about the old ppl or ppl on wheel chairs. What will they do if they something as simple as water.

And the plane itself is horrible. Screen n headphone jacks don't work in some of the seats. I was sitting at one unfortunately. Vomit in restroom. Toilet paper missing. The aircrew stored trash in one restroom and it was unusable.

My suitcase chain was cut open from the TSA lock. And the lock is missing. Items damaged and a phone box torn open. The phone was not in the box luckily. M sure it's an attempted theft.

- When I fastened the seat belts the straps looked dirty and used
- when I asked for 2 things (glass of water & when the electricity would commence) I did not get a response (i.e. no water) and for the electricity supply I had to ask around 3 times before it was established
- the champagne I ordered was lukewarm
- the film offering was not mostly mediocre and outdated
- the cable that connected the remote control for the entertainment unit would not lock itself so it was always under tension
- electricity for my laptop was not available to start with (see above), and finally only for a short time
- the first set of headphones did not work, I was provided with a replacement
- the flight map function was not available
- no landing cards for India were issued during the flight, so I had to queue twice for immigration!
All in all an experience that was not worth being called business class!"

I had not problems with eight but the check in agent weighed our cabin bags. Very unusual for business class travel especially when you about $1000 Australian for two seats in Business. We paid half that for a similar business class flight in USA. The lounge was ok with limited food variety. Boarding was not a normal for a business class but ok. The business class cabin was a very clean and good compared to what I had read about the cabin condition form others. The most surprising thing to not was that the allocated to us was very polite and actually wanted to serve us. I remarked to her about her being very different from others, i had heard about. The chief on cabin was like othersI had heard about. This young flight Attendant was very apologetic about our choice of meal was not available to both my wife and me. We both did not eat our meal. I asked Hostess to pass to their seniors about this. This problem could be solved if ability to choose meal was allowed before like other business class airlines. We travelled on flight AI 317 at1305 but forgot to get the name of the hostess to actually mention her by name. I hope the company recognises her best efforts. She was a breath of fresh air of Air India. The arrival at mumbai was a saga also. The aero bridge was not used and it took ground staff about 20 minutes to bring and to connect the mobile steps to aircraft to commence deplaning. There were about 15 staff staff on the ground but the equipment was not prepositioned. The bus took us to terminal but the driver only opens one door for deplaning when we have two sets. The Airport at Mumbai is very good design. Then the Saga of arrival of bags. Our business class bags took longer to arrive then the economy class bags. Then the Quarantine wanted to scan all our bags even when we had only a domestic sector from Delhi to Mumbai. Another senior staff waved us through when I asked if domestic pax bags scanned even when everything was scanned at Delhi. Then all ok the best was when we saw the Ramada Hotel staff waiting for us with a placard."

We were aware of the troubles in Assam as a consequence of an Indian Government Bill on citizenship so we booked a flight out the same day as we understood that the airport was being blockaded.  The night before travel we booked a flight on Air India to travel out to Kolkata. The Druk Air flight (Royal Bhutan Airlines) was running late but this only lessened our layover. Then, for reasons unknown, Air India moved our original flight from a 2pm time slot to 12.20pm. At that point I contacted Air India to advise that we could not make that accept that time change and advised we would need ot change from AI7930 to AI775. So, we were covered - or so we thought. Later Air India changed the flight back to 2pm. The flight into Guwahati was later than expected but we thought we were covered. As AI775 was scheduled for 6.45.   The only snag was Air India reservations has done nothing.  
I explained to the Duty Manger the situation who did next to nothing other than offer the chance to repurchase seven seats on AI775 for over INR110,000. 
The Druk Air representatives did their best to convince Air India that they should try to help but to no avail. 
There is little wonder that Air India is struggling to make a profit and win customer appeal. The new carriers are taking market share - and now it is easy to see why. 
Given the circumstances, I though using a more expensive full-service carrier would have flexibility and certainty to a challenging situation. It only added bureaucracy and unhelpfulness."

The seat allotation was done before the flight and was honoured. The checkin and bag screening was no more or less chaotic than normal Indian domestic airlines. The one major advantage is that AI allows 25 kgs in checked bags as compared with most other carriers at 15kgs.

This trip was just under 20 hours bed to bed. 

Arrival and departure times are friendly with a mid morning departure and an early evening arrival. 

We had reservations based on other reviews but we wanted direct. We took advantage of their upgrade program and 24 hours before departure got a confirmed business class seat at roughly 50% of tack pricing.

I flew from air India on dec 8th from Mumbai. 
1. There is no one to assist or direct you while you randomly try to understand which queue you should join.
2. No point to web -check in. You have to wait forever to just drop bags.
3. The employees would randomly leave their open counters for hours, until some customer asks for explanation and yet they do not respond.
4. I had a flight originally scheduled to fly at 9:50 am I was in bag drop line from 7:40 am. Had only 12 people in front of me , yet I received my boarding pass at 9:15 am.
5. There were a lot of people who were missing their flights due to the terrible management of the ground staff.
6. When finally I reach my gate, my flight is now delayed and boarding started at 10:15, finally take off at 10:50 am
7. The flight is so dirty that you might wanna puke. There are stains and dirt on the seat covers.
The window pane appears to be a decade old and lastly when I was too tired to look anywhere else I saw peanuts spilled at the corner of my leg area.
This was the last nail in the coffin. To buy a ticket of 5000 INR to have this service is beyond unacceptable.

The only pros :
1. They allow 25 kg luggage as check in
2. You get a free meal as part of your ticket.

Well, it is bad especially if you someone who used to deal with airlines who operate on time or at least within reasonal amount of delays. With Air India, delays are consistent. So, I am definitely avoiding Air India to safe myself from the frustration. Also, most airlines delays happen because of the weather conditions, but this airline always late despite the weather."

Service etc. is good and general flying experience is good. Seat screens don't always want to work on a few flights taken which on long haul can be rather annoying. Will fly with them again as also do offer exellent value for money and cover all of India which is great."

I booked my flight from delhi to varanasi with return ticket.first flight from delhi to varanasi in morning was cancelled a day before at night and they have not provided me the reason and in return they was providing me the flight at evening which was not suitable so i have to book anotger flight at expensive rate and this happening have not stopped here during return journey they delayed my flight by one hours and do not have any alternative for that due to which i missed my train. As a recommendation do not book this flight as most of the time they either cancels or delay the flight. The upper management is enjoying the position of psu as govt support is with them from our hard earned income as income tax. They should be privatize or closed"

Arriving from a remote area outside Mumbai 3 hours early for our flight to Kochi we went to check in & were casually told 'that flight's  fully booked, go to the Service desk'! We had booked these flights 7 months previously and even had allocated seats. We received no communication from them re checking in/do you want the seats etc.After a long wait at the Service desk the staff member then spent 30 minutes looking at his screen, ignoring our enquiries about the situation. He finally said he could get us 1 seat! That refused he said we could stay at a hotel & get a flight the next morning.Scant details re these but he said a driver would take us & collect us next morning at 0245 fo a 0530 flight. Now really, it was 2130 by then, the hotel we arrived at was the Hotel Sukh at Juhu. Nice area but this was the dirtiest old noisy hotel ever, with the rudest staff who could not have given a damn if you stayed or went! They gave us a wake up call at 0200!! We had no apology from Air India staff at any stage. We have now written to them re this fiasco & received an acklowledgement of the email & were directing it to the appropriate department. As a result of this we missed our ongoing accommodation & were veery much out of pocket."

Government takeover and political meddling made it one of the worst airlines today, the other being Kuwait airlines. Mumbai - Newark 14 hour flight and JFK - Delhi 13 hour flights that I flew did not have In-flight entertainment. The crew tried rebooting it but still not working. In the few seats where this was working the movies were not up to date. Crew seemed to be fed up of the airline too and could not do much. The aircraft seemed old and worn out with broken armrest and some remotes were not working. Flights from India had good food with curd and pickle."

Checkin ok
Seats are not comfortable no cushions
Entertainment not working

About air hostess 

All are nearly 60s 
Not even a smile 
No Hospitality
Preordered meal but they served a worst meal 
Can't even question them 
They are like robots 
They come timely and distribute food and they will disappear
One of the worst experience

The return flight AI 144

Newark to Bombay

Checkin is smooth ok 

On boarding gate the airindia staffs create a unwanted chaotic scene
To collect the hand carry
This should be avoided 
Bcoz most of the passengers are old aged even dont speak English

On board experience is good

Air hostess are good in service

Same average food 

Seats are same not fit for 14 hours travel

We can't change airindia 

We can go for some other airlines

They introduced the Boeing 787 Dreamliners for their direct flights from Delhi to Paris, London, Frankfurt, etc., which should have been good news but the poor maintenance of the aircraft dampens the overall experience. The price of a return ticket was competitive, but the rustiness of the aircraft was quite evident. From my seat, I was able to see that quite a few of the in-flight entertainment systems weren't working. They were mostly frozen or weren't taking inputs from the remote. The middle-aged French couple seated on the two seats next to me almost looked embarrassed when they struggled to push the seats back to get a more comfortable position. On top of that, the lady's remote broke and the touchscreen's options were also not accepting any commands. Thankfully the food was better than I thought along with the liquor options. Also, the crew was good and the flights are generally on time. So, if they want to survive perhaps they should get the planes serviced and start acting on the consumer feedback. 
It could be a one-off experience, so I'd still recommend it as it saves time and well, it's Indian."

However, we didn't enjoy the flights due to various reasons: First, the seats were to be convertible into full beds, which did not happen. It was like a semi-recline and so we couldn't sleep well. Then the USB ports were damaged and so I couldn't charge my cell phone. The entertainment system was very slow and didn't work in some seats. The toilets too were ordinary and didn't have many normal, needed  usables like paper cups. There was no Wi-Fi.
I have traveled in business class in other airlines like Emirates where the atmosphere and the experience has been much better, with working free Wi-Fi even in economy class.

At the airport the flight people started boarding the passengers at about 9 pm so I was guessing that maybe there won't be too much of a delay beyond what had already been announced. Oh how wrong I was...
Everything that could go wrong probably went wrong..the flight attendants and other staff for some reason kept asking some passengers to shift some cabin baggage to the cargo section..these formalities kept taking time..when a lady asked for help in placing her bag in the overhead compartment,a flight attendant told her it's not my job, what can I do😯
Another passenger asked when the flight would leave, another attendant replied that go and ask the captain😠 It was extremely unexpected to find cabin crew behaving in such a rude and unprofessional manner..they kept announcing 10 minute delay for commercial reasons..i dont know what that means..in any case the delay extended to more than an hour..from 9 am to 11 am we kept sitting in the flight..the flight people didn't even have the courtesy to offer refreshments or even water to the already tired and harrassed passengers..it was a bad experience for me and I will think more than twice before I voluntarily book an air india flight ticket"

Only downsides was the lack of clean toilets everytime our flights were close to landing.

Whorse experience ever in my life, but had nothing to do with Air India.
Delhi airport Security check was a Living nightmare.
Men and women where separates?
One at a time we where led behind a curtain to wait for a lady to touch me literally all over my body and looked at me with her scary eyes like I was the whorse dangerous criminal in the entire World.
She took my only lighter and told me that she had to open all our bags to check for drugs😱
She did the same procedure on my 14 year old daughter which was a scary experience for her as well as it was for my 13 year old son.
Before our Arrival in India, we had massive of checks in Denmark.
I don’t understand why we had to go through all theese procedures so many times when we obviously and impossibly couldn’t have had any contact with the outside World behind the airportwalls
neighter in Denmark nor in India???
At our final arrival in Bangkok Security procedure was excatly the same as always in Thailand.
Photos were taken, stamps were put in our passports and visas were issued quite quick like I had tried many times before."

The entire structure is incompetent. The airline is a joke. It would take two pages to write the most harrowing experience I had in just one flight I needed to take from mumbai to New Delhi to make my connection to Air Canada flight to Toronto. I missed the connecting flight to Toronto despite schedules to have a five hour lay over. The air India flight was late by 5 hours with no one helping with potential options. 

I booked a hotel and struggled to get seat on Air Canada the next day. All this despite I was a business class paid passenger."

This time, the flight was just short of 2 hours late and a lot of the screens didn't work. Once we got to AMD, it took ages for the baggage to come through. Some of the staff were doing their best and other were borderline rude.....I know they are in financial strain but manners don't cost anything and they should realize that they are responsible for providing a good service when people have paid money. Suffice to say I will avoid traveling with them in the future. FYI, I had 3 other flights with Air India on this trip and all were late, from 40 minutes to 4 hours...

Both kept on washing their hands off the problem and worst part scenario air india is not even refunding the money saying they are not responsible and claiming its a NoShow.

We pushed back from the stand at 19.25 and were actually airborne at 19.40, which was 50 minutes later than scheduled.

During an announcement by the Cabin Crew, there was an apology for the delay but no reason given. We were also informed that the flying time would be 1 hour and 15 minutes.

The aircraft was an Airbus A321, everything about it appeared a bit dated and jaded including the seating. On the plus side the legroom was generous and we were able to stretch our legs out.

About 15 minutes into the flight we were served with a snack box and a small bottle of water. The box contained a carton of juice and a finger sized sandwich with coleslaw filling. Thankfully sachet of tomato sauce was provided, gave the sandwich some flavour.

So despite leaving Goa 50 minutes late, we landed in Mumbai at 20.35, which was only 5 minutes later than scheduled and it was only a 55 minute flight and not 75 as announced. Airline scheduling at it's best."

1. No organization for boarding processes. Complete uncontrolled chaos.
2. Very poorly maintained aircraft. Broken seats, Broken Entertainment systems (no music, movies, nothing), No cushions (literally no cushions) on the seats, broken lights and air vents. That is just to the obvious stuff. Who knows what the mechanical is like.
3. No passenger control once on the flight. There were no clear safety rules enforced consistently. Passengers out and out yelling at each other at times and the crew just stood by and watched.
4. Inconsistent treatment of passengers. Westerners are definitely treated differently by aircrew."

The frustration started building during check in, where there were 100s of passengers standing in line, but only 3 counters were open, out of which one was operational for only baggage drop, and the other two counters were doing only check-ins for immediate flights. The speed was such that single check-in was taking more than 15 minutes. I was traveling with my 8 year old daughter, who had fever and no energy to stand for so long in the waiting queue. After about 40 minutes of standing in queue, I approached the staff doing check-in, requesting to accommodate my check-in request on priority, since there was no priority line for travelers with situation like us. To my amazement, the staff didn't utter a word, and ignored me totally. When I requested twice, she again gave a look, as if she didn't know what to do or say. Similar situation was faced by us, after arriving at Delhi international airport, where the queue towards baggage collection was almost a kilometer long and moving at snail pace, adding to the agony of tired and sick travelers. During flight also, the sound system wasn't working on my screen and therefore, I tried calling air hostess twice to address the issue but in vain. She kept giving lame excuses. Overall pathetic travel experience with air India, most of it coz of mismanagement and callous approach of staff."

Greetings! I heard so many bad comments about Air India but this time I configured it by myself. There is no doubt that government is going to privatize them because the staff is truly so unfriendly and so unprofessional. I had an international flight from Delhi to Sri Lanka on 30 November early morning. Unfortunately I took Air India from Dehradun to Delhi because it was dropping me directly at International terminal. Flight time was 8:30PM but on the screen it showed 1 hour delay which was ok but not convenient because my next flight was at 12:30 AM so anyhow I was suppose to be at counter at least one hour before. Air India announced that they are 2 hours delayed and they flew at 10:20 from Dehradun and we landed at 11:20 at Delhi. I ran away after picking my luggage from the belt but could not reach on time and finally I was a looser.
The horrible things was when I approached Air India counter they started to pass me to each other's counters. First person said you go to third counter, third one sent on 5th. I was just tired of their freaking lazy system. They are so careless and don't care about people who are suffering from their silly working. I seen so many people to fight with them because they are just careless. I wrote email to their customer service, nicely I got an automatic reply that very soon we will contact to you but still nothing happened.
I highly recommend people not to fly with them. If someone does please do it at your own risk. Thank you."

I recently travelled to Delhi with Air India, I thought it would be a good experience as it is their national airline. After booking my flight, I decided to pay nearly £200 for extra leg room seats (3 people). What a mistake that was! The check in staff refused to allocate our seats to us, they were rude and aggressive and accused me of forging the documents I had as proof of seats. I was left with no choice but to accept their seats otherwise we would have missed our flight . Air India is a budget airline and the food, entertainment and service reflect this. The male stewards are rude and unhelpful but the lady hostesses are friendly and allowed another western disabled lady who had also prepaid for her seat but didn’t get it, to sit in an extra leg room seat. On returning home, I contacted Air India and was told I could only ask for a refund if I email their e-commerce address but you’ve guessed it, I have sent several messages but of course they don’t respond! I strongly recommend if you are a westerner do not use Air India as they take your money and give your seat to an Indian traveller at you expense."

Who needs a meal in the middle of a long flight?Feed your passengers before they sleep or after they wake up—a totally redundant phenomenon which they should get away with immediately.The only advantage air India has is the nonstop convenience to passengers and truly I prefer other airlines these days even if there is a stopover,such as air Canada from Toronto nonstop to Mumbai"

"2019-12-05T20:24:56-05:00","1","review","1","Use them when you don't have other choices","One of the crappiest airlines around. I fly business class a lot and I use many different airlines because timing and duration are more important to me than FF points. Air India seems to be stuck in time. Their planes have a really old fit-out. The food on the plane is bland and unimpressive. The staff think they are teenagers working at KFC, hiding behind a curtain and playing with their phone. They are nice and smiley when you talk to them, and probably are just a shamed to be working in one of the worst major airlines in the world.

The lady at the business check in counter was so over it, thumping on her keyboard, making mistake after mistake with my details, and then she suddenly got up said ""Goodbye sir"" and started walking away. I looked at her, shocked. She turn back and said ""Did I give you your boarding pass?"". ""No, you didnt"". She huffed and came back into her chair to print it. Pfff, if not for the comedy factor I would lose it.

The business lounge in Delhi is spacious, but again, old looking; and the food, again, is disgusting (I love Indian food, but the food in the lounge is not that). I find myself eating at the foodcourt at the airport and coming into the lounge only to work using the wifi. But wait, air India thinks Wifi is not a must have for the business traveller. I've spent 5 hours in the lounge using my roaming mobile hot spot because the wifi at the lounge was faulty and Air India put zero effort to fix it. Come on. It's almost 2020, when you have a lounge full of customers who paid $4K+ for their business tickets you make sure they can do their business and fix the wifi. But instead, the staff in the lounge were angry with me for asking about fixing the Wifi ""Sir, Air India will not fix the wifi. We have asked for it, but they will not fix it!"". (This was said to me by an Air India lounge staff).

So again, if your time is precious and Air India has a much shorter flight times or better schedule, then appreciate your life and loved ones and get home early. But if you have other flight options, use those and avoid this backward airline until they pick up their game."

I have never experienced any airline refusing to write a damage report and the Air India Sri Lankan staff saying to the handling agent if we write a report that it's damaged then we have are liable so this is open condition. What load of BS!"

And cancelled my ticket, when i request they said nothing can be done as i start leaving from there they allow two different person for boarding and when i asked the reason they said it is emergency case... When i aksed how can they flush my money like this and aksed for arrangement in next flight they said it is also full and nothing can b done, but online tickets were available when i aksed about it they start ignoring and running from their places atlast they said buy new tickets now from us for differnt flight time.

But the apathy and inefficient service in Delhi was disgraceful and nerve wracking - people missed their flights, or flights were delayed because it took 4 hours to get to the gate!
The exaggerated time to get to the gate was not because of security checks or passport control, but because of the poor service of the airline.
It is the country's govt. airline, the largest check-in area in the airport - but less than half the desks were manned.
When I complained about waiting over two hours just to get to the check-in counter, one of the workers, just sitting doing nothing said ""It's a government run airline"". That was their customer service.
They just do not care.
I for one, will never fly Air India again."

We eventually found out where we needed to be and checked in only to be issued with boarding passes with different seats to those pre booked allocated. Eventually told that a different aircraft was in service but no one was very bothered or interested.
Boarded the aircraft and all was well for a while. Have to say the entertainment was abysmal with old old movies & t.v.shows. One drinks service only and meals that weren't really all that great. All crew disappeared for a good few hrs leaving water,juice and cake in the galley so you had to help yourself. Crew only reappeared about 90 mins before landing.
Return journey not any better with window blinds all closed despite it being a day flight and an announcement made to the effect that people should not not recline their seats as it bothered those behind !! People given seats with extra leg room despite having not paid for them (we had paid!!)only because they got annoyed with the crew when they were around. Wouldn't fly long haul with AI again ever."

The business lounge used in Birmingham is not very good (compared with Emirates which is first rate).
Noticed reduction of frills enjoyed by business passengers this time,it does not bode well particularity if the fares are going up all the time!

I wanted to change the date of travel and was told that after completing one leg of journey,one change is free,not true! They wanted INR 6000
If the flight is changed from Amritsar and you wish to fly back from Delhi (no change in distance) then it is classed sector change and AI wanted INR 21000,does not make any since when other airlines happily allow travel from one or other airport eg Emirates let you choose any Indian Airport !

The choice of music and films is phenomenal,flat beds are wearing out and need re furbishing,dream-liner is not as comfortable as in the past. Meal was good but no breakfast prior to arrival!!

The weight allowance is good at 32x2 Kg for business as opposed to 23x2 for economy.

"2019-11-24T15:29:45-05:00","1","review","4","Worse than pathetic","1. Starts with Premium Seats- You book a premium seat by paying $50 extra. if AI Staff is trvelling and checked in ahead of you. Your premium pre-selected seat is gone. You are a fool now. if you try to argue, they will treat you a fool. If you ask for a refund, they will say- ""had you paid money to me? what refund? Go and ask refund to that telephone guy, who you had paid money"". 
If you talk to their feudal supervisors like ""I had booked seat 17x and i has been alotted to someone else. Why ? Help me get my pre-paid , prebooked sear back"" That guy will act like a feudal lord and try to intimidate you. First try to insult you with statements ""Front seat? do you know what you are talking? Front is Business and you are economy. Now just go to your economy seat.Dont waste my time""
When you counter "" Its not about front or back, its about seat 17x""
then Feudal lord will again insult you"" Do you even know, its paid seat. what you are talking about? go back""
you counter again"" Thats what I said wih my opening statement. stressing ""Pre-paid"" and ""Pre-assigned"" seat has been allotted to someone else. Help me get my seat back""
Feudal lord will roar again ""Why should U trust you.""
You get some more courage to talk and pull out the printout ""Sir, here is the evidence of seat allotment and payment"".
And The Feudal Lord their floor supervisor will just run away !! Other staff will ask you, you wanna fly or miss the flight. They will scold you, get inside if you want to go.

Hats off the shrewd and screwed hospitality of Maharaja !! Full of himuliatio, intimidation and insults to the passengers who paid $1250 (higher than other airlines just for sake of Desh Prem)

2. Air hostess/ Stewards- Folks, remember, sun never rises from west, so do the AI hostesses and attendants. You press the 'call attendant' button and they will never ever come to your seat asking what happned.You die their for something, any emergency happns for any elderly person, take my words AI hostess/ steward wont come to your seat

3.Food- Used to be good till 2018. Now pathetic would be understatement. Quality has degraded substantially and they reduced one meal too recently to save on costs, even though they charge you 1250$. Similar haul flighs serve you 3 meals, AI served just 2 even when flight took 4 more hours.Literally, really and physically starved

Snacks (chips/ Soda/ Water/ Drinks) - heavily rationed with a strong eye. How other airliners do on such long haul flights
Emirates- they place plenti of such stuff like Cucakes, chips, peanuts, coke/ soda/ water , sandwiches at central location and you are free to take. Qatar staff is always there to come to your seat and serve.

But AI- guys no snacks, No water. Remember point #2, they wont come to your seat. When you trace these feaudal lords to their Den, the response you can expect is 
a. Dont you see, its our break and we are eating snacks. come after 30 minutes.  You beg, i am very thirsty, just water please. Nad they retort, our break time. come later.
b, You go later and ask for water again, you get a cup of water. You ask again, and listen- 'dude, how much water you need' already gave you two cups.
c. Drinks- yeah, once they serve, then forget.

Food serving attitude- Cant be explained in words. Fly once to see, how these feudal lords serve food in AI 101/102/103/104 flights. Remember, you are a begger and starving for almost 6 hours now. and someone with a big heart suddenly pulls in with a trolly and ray of hope. These lords will start trowing food packets / trays. Get up on your seat and hold it.
Sssssh, are you sleeping ? Get ready to be scolded. ""Mr/ miss get up. Food is here. How many times, I need to say you""

4. Entertainment- Do you need more after enjoying 1,2 and 3 above? Still craving for entertainment, try to turn on the TV on seat. Much to your pleasure, more than 60% of these screens wont function. Even the one workings would be sluggish to respond with a poor selection of movies and soaps.

5. Restrooms and toilets- On this 16 hour flight, avoid using them 10 hours. Most of them would be damn dirty by now and clogged as well. God Knows how Maharaja manages !

6. Checkin ( Again)- Everywhere they print ""Come ATLEAST 3 HOURS PRIOR to departure time. And try it yourself,if you came, you are a BIG FOOL. For 1:30 AM flight AI doesnt open the checkin counter before 10:30 PM. If you try to show them the print stating ""Come ATLEAST 3 HOURS PRIOR...."", They will try to convince you to improve upon your language skills and get some basic english in place. They interpret is as come after 3 hours is left to depart the flight. This situation prevails at DEL/BOM/ JFK/EWR and IAD. If you came prior to 3 hours before departure, hold your luggage and enjoy your time.
For them, its fun when they have a big long queue already in place to open the checkin. Planning, peace, comfort, convenience is not in Maharaja and AI dictionary.
Once they see all 380 passengers are there, all in queue, the feudal lords will OPEN 2 CHECKIN counter and let your feel the heat of their power and might. They painful journey started with waiting un-necessarily for counter to open and now such a long queue with 2 counters only. AI ensures that you stand in this queue / security till 1:30 am till final boarding call in your name is made.
Even this was not enough, you will notice some travellers have staff friends. For many minutes the queue will not move for such reason. The staffs will oblige their friends and family by taking their passport/ ticket to counter from backend and generate boarding passes.

well,very long story and much more horror story can be shared. Tired of writing this and bored as well, 

Stopping here. Bye Bye AI."

Service was indifferent, food was just about ok. The in-flight entertainment system had limited choices. There weren't enough blankets for everyone. For the first time in my fairly extensive flying experience, I was in a plane that did not show the flight information - the system showed an error message as the app wasn't working. This was also my first international flight where there was no in-flight duty free (or for that matter any) shopping option. 

The only plus I can think of is that this was a 787 Dreamliner so it was a fairly stable flight given the extreme turbulence on this sector, and we had ample leg room, easily the best in economy class compared to any other airline (I've flown all the major ones)."

The refreshment served comprised of a vegetable sandwich, a tetra pack of Mango Juice (forgot the brand name), plus a glass of water. The flight landed at the international terminal, as always done by Air India at Ahmedabad.

Until deboarding and immigration, all was well. It was during the baggage claim that the unexpected happened.

Air India said that since ours was a connection flight from Colombo and the flight from Colombo had been delayed, the baggage ""could not be loaded"". The check in baggage was at Mumbai only. A customs form had to be filled, baggage tags had to be attached and the bags reached my home only the next day evening. The process took nearly half an hour and was a strain on our mental energy and physical energy as well, after arriving all the way from Colombo via Mumbai.

The flight is ideal for an international connection, but if you want to travel domestically, take one of the private carrier flights."

First of all, we received the good news of our flight delayed by 1 hr. Perfect. Then the queue at the check in counter was very long, with CMB-DEL passengers also in the fray to get the bags checked in.

The immigration was a bit slow. The boarding, upon reaching the gate, was delayed by yet another 45 mins. Passengers had to wait in the security hold area near the gate.

Slept inflight so couldn't comment on that much, other than the fact that the crew was well groomed and trained, bearing a smile. The aircraft, an A321 Airbus Industirie, was a bit dated.

Food lacked a bit though, considering it was the lunch time (13:00) at that instance. The fact that our earlier flight from Ahmedabad was delayed by 2 hrs did worry us a bit but due to sufficient layover time, we were able to catch the Colombo flight quite comfortably.

The aircraft, an A321, was obviously dated. And consequently, in a bit of a need of maintainance.

Being the domestic leg of my international journey to Colombo from Ahmedabad (AI 18), I decided to reach International Terminal of Ahmedabad Airport at 4:20 am (flight departure time at 7:10 am), nearly 3 hrs before departure.

The staff of Air India had the worst ever attitude. They said that they'll begin the baggage screening (mandatory before checkin) only at 5 am. On asking why the website stated that passengers should arrive 3 hrs before departure, they said they had no answer but forced us to wait for the next 1 hr outside the terminal. Very appaling.

Nextly, I had done web check in with the hope that my time at the check in counter would be saved. But Air India surprisingly said that the Ahmedabad airport does not have """"sufficient infrastructure"""" for having a separate bag drop counter. I mean, you're operating this flight from the commercial capital of Gujarat. 

The ironic fact is that Ahmedabad was one of the first destinations of Tata Airlines which was the predecessor of Air India and yet, Air India complains of insufficient infrastructure.

The flight was delayed but I don't blame the airline for that - there was a medical emergency on the incoming flight. The boarding was fortunately quick. Refreshment (sandwich) was served before boarding due to 2 hr flight delay.

Inflight experience saved the day. The food was excellent. The crew was smiling and helpful. Thank you so much.

Overall not recommended unless you've an international connection like me. Otherwise there are other private carriers to choose from."

1. Most video units in economy are broken. 
2. Remote control was broken - this means you cannot turn on/off lights, cannot call for help from steward/stewardess. My kid couldn't watch TV. They had a central control to turn off all lights which randomly went off. And because most overhead seat specific lights were broken - she couldn't read either.
3. They don't have toilet seat covers!
4. They started to run out of toilet paper
5. Soap dispensers inside toilets were broken.
6. Food from SFO to Delhi was tolerable. Food from Delhi to SFO was downright nasty. When I went up and asked about all the broken things - the answer I got from stewards/stewardess was new management- nothing they can do.

Lastly, the flight back from Delhi to SFO - the steward and stewardess were so de-sensitized to all the request from passengers - they didn't even try to help or problem solve. They seemed like they didn't want to be bothered with asks to help. 

With the number of things broken - I wouldn't be surprised if their engines were poorly cared for too.

Air India is total scam... the most rotten long flights I have had in 4 decades of flying.

When we arrived a the airport of Katmandou, there was a one hour delay indicated. We immediately asked to a member of the Air India staff what will happen to our transit flight and she said that we did not had to worry because the transit flight will wait for us. We were not sure about this so during the flight, which finally departed with a 2-hour delay, we asked to two more stewards about our transit flight and they again said that we did not had to worry because the flight will wait for us. All this was just a lie from all those people. We arrived at the airport with a delay of more than 2 hours, and they told us that the transit flight left without us… We thus contacted the staff of Air India to ask them to give us a new flight to Colombo and they said that they can’t do anything for us since our next flight was with another company... We have spent 5 hours (5! with just a 25cl bottle of water for free...) in their office to try to solve the problem, it was totally impossible. They told us that we had to pay another ticket (200€ each since last minute) to leave Delhi, and that perhaps, but it is not sure, we will be reimbursed by the company. How does this airline company dare to threat people like this? They lied to us, they forced us to pay 400€ for their own mistake, and we are not even sure that we will have our money back. 
This is a nightmare ruining our holidays and our budget for our holidays since this procedure will probably take months.  This can’t happen.. And airline company company has committed a mistake and we have to pay for this? This is totally intolerable. They Lie, they are totally inapt to take any responsible for their own mistakes.

The flight from Delhi to Mumbai got so delayed that we missed the Mumbai to Trivandrum flight by a few minutes. The Air India staff in Mumbai were not apologetic even though it was not our fault. They did not care. 

They told us the next available flight was in the evening the next day. When I asked them about accommodation and booking an earlier flight with another airlines, they told us they will not help us with accommodation as it is not their airline. They were not sympathetic.

There's only one woman dealing with all this and she was genuinely yawning, bored and mostly on the phone. It would've made such a difference if she was engaging, apologetic and being helpful but instead she was annoyed and not helping us to stay calm and giving solutions- she wasn't doing her job well. Her name was  Bharti Dejani and when I asked for her manager Foss Alwin Mascol- he said even if I book a flight with another airline I wouldn't be guaranteed a seat, it made no sense. The customer service is so poor and incompetent. 

They eventually pressured us to GO BACK TO DELHI. Wait for 5 hours for the flight from there to Trivandrum. I've had no sleep. They didn't upgrade our flights or make it more comfortable for us even though it is THEIR fault. I don't even know for sure if all my luggage will be in Kerala.

The boarding card had a departure time of 18:30 without mentioning the delay or offering the earlier flight at17:00 (this flight by the way departed on time!!)

The flight got pushed to 19:30 at which time they finally offered food despite this the departure time remained at 19:30 

The monitors never updated after this point and it was pure luck that I returned at the gate at 20:30 to find boarding nearly completed.  For a 21:10 take off

Rarely have I experienced a more disorganized lack of information. 

At no point was any explanation for the delay given. Not even on the plane or upon arrival 

I can not recommend air India as a reliable partner if you are on a schedule"

The plane on the flight out was grubby and did not look as if cleaners had been in from the previous flight (food crumbs and stains all over the tray, bits on the floor and generally mucky) and the internal general condition was poor. 9 hours sat with no in-flight entertainment was not great especially since the overhead lights didn't work either so could not read and it was exactly the same on the flight back so in all, 18 hours staring into space.  The staff on the way out were pleasant, helpful and did a good job unlike the return journey. Most of the crew on the way back were off hand, surly, unhelpful and spent most of the time in the galley having a good time chatting and laughing totally ignoring their passengers leaving all the basic work to 2 of their colleagues who were run off their feet.  The return flight had been delayed due to the cyclone in Goa and waited for 84 passengers for about 1 hour 30mins but somehow, on arrival at Heathrow,  little help was given to the delayed passengers who had missed their connecting flights. We witnessed  2 stewards speaking to a couple of passengers and were both rude and just short of offensive.  The seats did not seem to have any 'stuffing' on the back and we felt as if we were sitting on cardboard. The food was particularly grim on the return flight and all in all, a pretty ghastly time was had by all. I now know why they are cheap.  Did they get us there and back in one piece, yes, but definitely a case of you get what you pay for."

I am disappointed with their customer service and have and will continue to give you a bad review on your website until this is sorted.  As I have explained to your customer service I purchased a flight with you from New Delhi to Jaipur on 4th November for two people.  I paid for this flight and then received notification or an error without showing the booking reference and was asked to contact customer service.  On contacting them I was informed that as I didn’t receive an email confirming the flight which would have the booking reference they could not help me.
I have spoken to my bank and the money is pending transaction.  I now am £112.92 short in my account as this payment is committed to Air India with no flights.  Please cancel this payment as this is thief.

I will be posting this on as many websites as I can regularly until my money is returned as a warning to others not to fly with Air India.  I will also be bringing it to the attention of the newspapers and India Tourist board along with the Trip Adviser etc.

This time I wanted to fly directly, hence I chose Air India. I was really excited about traveling with Air India, but that excitement quickly turned when I entered the plane. It was completely worn out. The hideous carpet, the seats, the entertainment system - everything was just outdated and worn out. This is just the plane, the service was the real disappointment. My co-passenger had a child, and asked for a bottle of water for formula. She asked 3 times, but never received any. She was visibly annoyed, so I chose to help her out, and walk directly towards the air hostess stances. I politely asked for a bottle of water and the air hostess just looked arrogantly at me, and pointed towards the cupboard ""take it yourself"". I was in shock of the lack of service and ethics.

On my way back home from Delhi, the service was a bit better but as mentioned, their planes are worn out. My seat was collapsed as I could feel the metal plates underneath the seat. I requested to be re-seated, which they did after take off. After this, the plane got extremely cold. They had turned on the AC on high, and everyone on board were getting really cold and began putting on more clothes. I put on my wintercoat, which I had brought with me from Denmark, as it was cold before I departed from Denmark. I got really annoyed, and asked them why they had the AC on such a cold level. To this the air hostess replied ""its not in my control, but I'll look into it"". Indeed it was in their control, because it got better 10 minutes after.

Lastly, I had survived India for 2 weeks without any physical problems, but right after eating the food on the plane, I got diarrhea. Thank you Air India! Thank you for solidifying that you are completely incapable of doing anything good to represent your nation! Never ever again!"

We booked paid  from Shimla to Delhi in July for a flight in November

Two weeks before they emailed to cancel our flight supposedly for operational reasons. But when I checked the flight was still shown as flying but full. 

Over two hours of phoning and four conversations with lengthy holds I was told to book with another airline (there are none) or to rebook on a later flight (there is only one a day).

Finally managed to rebook for the next day a new flight, possibly only  because I rang  before they got around to refunding me. 

Then I was emailed a week later to say the new flight had been cancelled. Again online the flight was shown as still flying but full. 

I can only assume we have been bumped of the flight to allow someone who ""more profitable"" on than us who has only paid the advertised price online. 

There was no interest and no help in finding alternative travel arrangements. And the trains for our dates were all full. We have ended having to get to our destination by a 10hr coach ride rather than a one hour flight.

We had 5 bags, out of which we had to pass 3 bags weighing total 42 kgs in check-in and other 2 bags weighing total 16 kgs in cabin.
One of the bags in the check in weighed 10kgs.
So now coming to the policy, the person at the counter said that the maximum weight allowed per bags for check in is 25kgs and not more than that and for cabin it has to be 8kgs Max per bag.
Though we convinced him that he should adjust for the check in luggage but for the cabin luggage we had to pay extra for 2kgs which was 1000.
There was no such information provided in the ticket. Prior to this we had travelled a week back with no such rule.
Whom to blame here?? Is it the Airlines for not providing this new rule in the ticket??

I booked 5 flights - but ended up taking 8 due to their bizarre routing.

To go from Delhi to Varanasi, the plane flew first to Gaya.  What I didn't realise was that Gaya is further from Varanasi than Delhi is. In effect, our flight was similar to doing London to Munich via Athens. Not only was it ridiculously further than it should have been, the flight was also very late by the time it arrived.

Two of our other flights also did ridiculous routes, overshooting the destination before coming back again.  Two of the five flights had their times changed, one changed back again, and then eventually left even later than the original change. Honestly, you don't know what time you're ever going to get anywhere with these guys.

Food varies between a bit 'meh' and disgusting coleslaw sandwiches. It doesn't matter if you cut the crusts off, a coleslaw sandwich is still a painful disappointment.

I dialed again and this time, the executive transferred my call to the concerned department for the information and it is 30 mins that I am holding the line with no response / action.

Not like when traveling from IsraeI when in Bangalore I was forced to send my small suitcase in to the airplane (instead of taking it with me to the airplane), not as planned.
I have arrived to Delhi almost 3 hours before the connection flight but only when boarding to the connection I was rushed to a location where I was told that there is a problem with my luggage and I have to through away a power bank. they took it in front of my eyes and put it into the garbage (just to take it for them self right after I left). All this was done in a rush while telling me that if I'll won't hurry I'll miss the flight and promising me that this suitcase will be on my flight.
I was taken back to the boarding which closed doors right after I have come just to find that my seat was given also to a different passenger and I don't have where to sit. 
Then came the first good thing with this flight - I demanded to get a sit by the window as planned so I got a sit near an emergency exit and with a lot of place to my legs.
When arriving to Tel Aviv I found that the suitcase ""with the problem"" was left in Delhi with some important medicine (which I had to buy in Israel) and I got the suitcase only 3 days later,

Must say that all the behavior was very frustrating and annoying."

The airline then indicated that there was limited options to get to Newark on Saturday morning.  The Maharja lounge for Air India in Chennai was small, limited in service, food, drinks.  The Air india agent/s in Chennai were unorganized, overwhelmed, disrespectful to customers, and lacking focus to attend to and resolve one customer's needs.  Once the solution was identified, it took over 45 minutes to receive my boarding pass and obtain my tickets.  The gate agent said that they did not have business class seats on the flight, even though my initial itinerary was booked for business class.  Upon arrival at the gate, I inquired with the gate agent of a seat in business class, and they confirmed that one was available and gave me the appropriate seat assignment.  Air India needs to work on their customer service structure, organization, and employee customer service ability and training.

At this stage must say Airline certainly built in some buffer time for delays, allowing 90 minutes for a 55 minute flight

The Aircraft turned up at 16.05, which was 20 minutes before we were due depart. We actually boarded at 16.45.

We were informed that our departure was as result of the late arrival of the incoming flight and then waiting for a delayed connecting flight. We actually sat on the tarmac for the best part of 45 minutes.

Finally we were Airborne at 17.30 an hour and 5 minutes later than scheduled.

We were informed that the flight would be 55 minutes.

The legroom was good, however the interior of the aircraft was grubby, the seat belts were sticky and the doors to the overhead lockers were dirty. In fact even the yellow life jackets used in safety demonstration heavily soiled.

15 minutes into the flight we were given a snack box which contained a carton of juice and a very small coleslaw sandwich. It was no surprise when opening my tray table to find remains of dried food on the table.

We landed at 18.15, which was 20 minutes late arriving.

Thankfully it was only a short internal flight."

However.......

On both legs of this trip the service was sub par - Stewards were disinterested and seemed put out with basic requests such as water to drink. Toilets were filthy and had no paper most of the time.

To top it off, for Delhi-Syd check in (which was an agonisingly slow process just for bag drop) we were told that there were not two seats together. We protested as we had booked the tickets together but were still just handed boarding passes for separate seats. When we asked to speak with someone else this problem was instantly fixed.

Once your bags were found, they issued a new boarding pass. 
Because i was coming from a flight with baggage on the piece system, i had two pieces and was over their 20kg limit. I've travelled this route many times before and never had this level of insolence, unhelpfulness, and outright lying. The women told me that I had 46 kgs (it was only 40 once weighed) and insisted that I would have to pay $400 plus tax for my extra 26 kg. I tried to show them information from the AI website to show that $120 was allowed for an extra bag. This went on for three hours until it was close to time for the flight. 
They let a couple of other passengers from my flight through even though their bags had not yet been found. Finally the call came that my bags were found. So I went to pay but one of the staff would have to take my credit card up two floors to process the payment. 
So, i gave them cash. The senior woman shouted at me that it was only $300 .... but their seen by everyone (me and her collegues) was the other $100 bill with her finger clutching it to the $20 bill. She glared at me and acted like it was a mistake. Then I asked if i could have a receipt, which created more hassle but eventually one staff was sent to go get one. 
Then a call that the  bags were only 40kg total. Meanwhile, the second woman was stalling giving me my boarding pass so that I could proceed. Her male colleagues were actually telling her to get it done. Finally, she gave me the new boarding pass (I already had an Air Canada one from the previous flights  check-in). 

Finally, the staff came with the receipt and the $100 bill that was not needed for just 20 kg extra. But, the senior woman walked up to the security check just ahead of me. Some words were said. The security staff tore apart my hand luggage while she watched. Finally it was done and the nice young man staff escorted me to the gate. I was the last passenger to get on the plane but will not be flying with Air India again. 
Then the other passengers whom i had been with at the start said that one of the gate staff told them that the bags being transferred never come into the airport and are just moved from plane to plane. 
Is all this 'finding your bags downstairs' just a scam to get money out of foreign passengers? One has to wonder."

I have flown and written about AI earlier also and will continue to write as I do for other airlines/hotels. Unlike other airlines, AI is the only business entity who has never replied/contacted me.
When I wanted to web check-in 24 hours before for our Madurai-Mumbai flight, I was horrified to see separate seats allotted by the 'system'. There was no choice available for a change. For a same PNR, same surname( me and my wife) and for a customer who is 2nd to web check-in, how can the system not allow me a choice of my seat( paid or free)? Worse, how could a system alot 2 separate seats( 17 B and 17E)- both middle seats on 17th row, for a couple travelling together? 
At the Madurai airport check-in counter, he refused to change the seat. which airlines in the world denies the change of seats. 
There is more to it. When I asked the counter guy to enter my 'frequent flyer no.', he said my name and number of AI don't match. This was a news to me. 
Coming to the aircraft, it was same type of aircraft for which I wrote earlier once. There is no place to keep water bottle, or my specs or even the mobile phone. Where does one keep these 'daily use' things? No reading material on all seats( 17, A, B,C)..
Coming to the food, ( I don't wanna talk about the sad faces of the crew), it was 'take it' or 'leave it' kind of approach. I could not understand what I was eating. I had to eat what was served since I boarded at 12 45 PM and it was around 3 PM when they served something.( it was a hopping flight via Chennai). 
One feels sad about our National Carrier. We also feel sad about their arrogance. While I wish them good future, I don't have any hopes (that someone will contact me)."

"2019-10-01T03:28:45-04:00","1","review","2","Baggage limits","So we booked with air India for the short hop to Agra. Knowing our baggage was well over the limit for the majority of Indian domestic carriers, we opted for Air India and their 25kg allowance. We checked, double checked, and checked all the T&Cs to make sure we didn't have it wrong, as my partner works in the airline industry and knows what's up. Anyway, after booking through air India website, for an air India flight, we arrive at the airport to be told its an air alliance flight, and we were overweight on the bagge, which now has a 15kg limit. We're not idiots, we checked this, and both agree that it is a clear deception to get extra money out of people. Had we not been rather irritated and possibly argumentative at that time of morning, we would have had to pay through the nose. Thankfully, the check in staff used a little class and had us move some of our clothing into hand luggage to save the bagge fees. This got us on the flight fine, but it makes me scratch my head as we still took the same amount onto the aircraft... Why couldn't we just leave it in the case?? Rediculous.

Anyway, as I said. Check the terms when booking with air India, and they'll still try and charge you more because air India falls under the air alliance umbrella apparently, which would have been useful to know before we booked the tickets, as the website did not mention this anywhere. See photo for an air India boarding pass too.. If I wasn't aware of the power the check in staff have over whether or not you actually make it to an aircraft, I'd have flipped my lid upon seeing that....."

Had to switch to Air-India recently because of the recent BA pilot's strike. The boarding process definitely needs work. They did not use microphones that day to announce departure. They just yelled the announcements - so not audible to all I am sure. Next, it was a 2 stage boarding. After the boarding pass was scanned, all passengers had to wait in a staging area to actually board the plane. Then, they boarded business class and economy class passengers together in one big mob. So definitely the boarding process needs work :-). But once on board, it is the best of indian experience. Quiet and efficient cabin crew. Very good food. Good pilots - smooth take off and landing. Good entertainment for Indian passengers like myself. So in-flight experience is just as good or better that British Airways. And it is way cheaper! The 4 stars is because on the boarding experience.

So I set my expectation so low that I am almost not expecting for a pleasurable flight anymore. However, when I was onboard AI315, my first Air India experience, I was surprised that I am liking everything that I see, contrary to all that I have read. The legroom is the only thing that I didn't rate excellent but everything is more than excellent with this airline. What I liked most is when I asked for a soda refill, the FA immediately poured another glassful of soda on my cup and gave me a whole can of soda afterwards. Not just one, but two!

AI 610 was late by over three hours, with the result that I missed the Swissair flight.  What happened thereafter was gross mismanagement accompanied by deceptive, inconsiderate, and totally unprofessional behavior.

I approached the AI counter in the Mumbai airport at about 1:30 a.m., and after waiting patiently for a while (i.e., till I discovered that the only way I would be heard was to shout above everyone else), managed to speak to the ONLY person at the counter, which was mobbed by about 50 people.  I explained that I needed to be rebooked to Zurich, and specifically informed him that I was over 65 years old, had serious medical issues, and would he please attend to this asap.  He was the manager on the spot, and appeared to be sympathetic and told me that there were five people (including me) that were to be rebooked to Zurich, and his staff would work on that immediately.

From 1:30 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., I repeatedly inquired (almost every 15 minutes) and he repeatedly told me that his staff was actually working on my very case. Around 5:15 a.m., I told the staff member allegedly working on my rebooking that I was on the verge of collapse, having been on my feet for over 24 hours.  At 7 a.m., the other staff member who, I had been told, was working on my rebooking, came with the rebooking for a co-passenger to Zurich, who was put on the 8:30 flight.  He told me for the first time that he did not even have my ticket details, and was unaware that I needed to be rebooked!  In other words, the AI manager had been giving me the runaround, blatantly lying to me. 

I went back to the counter, fought my way to the front, but the night manager who lied to me was gone.  He was replaced by another woman (no one has name tags in AI), and I gave her my details (again).  She was mobbed with even more people, and finally, I gave up at 8:30 a.m., bought myself a new ticket by Emirates, and extricated myself out of that mess. I did not want to be martyred in Mumbai airport for AI's gross mismanagement and deception.

I certainly don't blame AI for the massive floods in Mumbai that day.  But it was grossly mismanaged.  You had to mob the counter and scream over everyone else just to register your need or talk to someone.  And everyone was referred to the Manager, who was often not there.  AI must have a better system for rebooking passengers than convert it into a ""Lord of the Flies"" situation.

What was completely unacceptable - indeed, unconscionable - was that I was lied to and strung along for over seven hours for a task that should have taken seconds or minutes at most.  That I was was a senior citizen, seriously ill (both of which the manager on the spot was specifically informed), and didn't collapse at the Airport, but managed to step alive into the Emirates flight was purely fortuitous.  With such an experience, would you reasonably expect me to choose Air India again?"

We waited in line for quite a while to identify our luggage so they can double check and then an intense body search. However, this extra search/check could possibly be only for Afghans, I am not sure."

When Austrian airlines was operating that direct flight it was pure bliss. Then they stopped and the only direct flight available now is Air India.
Well at first that was bearable. But the steep decline in quality which is happening over the last one and a half years is really worrysome.
Whilst some of the crew are friendly and helpful, most of the staff is just doing the bare minimum of what is expected from them. No smiles, no helping, barking out orders at the customer and basicially not caring about good hospitality at all.
Obviously the ammenity pouches have been cut. Haven‘t received it on the last three flights.
In most of the flights no menu card is given. Instead a crew member is quickly, quickly telling you what is there to eat. But since they do neither bother to bend down to you, nor speak in an understandable speed and loudness, its somehow a guessing game.
Anyhow AI food was never good and so I spare myself the trouble.
In half of my flights within the last two years the inflight entertainment was not working and crew was not able to fix it. Same experience I have heard from a lot of frequent flyers, so its a long standing and known problem, which noone at AI seems to bother about.
Earphones have a pathetic quality and a lot of times exchange is needed because they are broken.
The choice of movies is pathetic.
The cabin and washrooms are not properly maintained and have a shabbyness to them, which has now reached an unacceptable level. 
This goes for the seats as well. Last year:One flight seat was not reclinable and in another flight the backpanel of seat was missing so all the wires and cables were hanging out.
It is obvious that the carrier is cutting costs massivly and that leads me to the question: If the inside is so badly maintained, what about the plane itself? Is that done properly? 
From next year onwards I will rather spend the double amount of time for going to my destination and changing flights, than everytime have to go through those nuissances with AI.
Recently I took Turkish. This was an eyeopener. This reminded me of how it should be and how the reality is with AI.
For all domestic flights I have been avoiding AI since long. Thankfully there are enough good choices."

I was carrying my bicycle with me and Air France allowed me to take it along from New Delhi.  
######### Before the flight 
>> I started contacting Air India almost 10 days before my flight in order to know whether I could carry my bike or not, I did that using their email which was not responded to.
>> I called their customer service number twice, each time it took like 30 minutes to have someone to talk to you. The people on the other side gave me contrasting information. So till this point I had no clue if I could take it with me or not.

######### Day of the Flight 
>> Going forward with the information that I had, which was based on the information provided on the website, according to which I would need to apply for the transit of the bike with the cargo operations. In order to do that I had to be at the airport about 3 hours before the departure, I was there 3:30 hours before. 
>> I was told to wait till the checkin counters opened after which the price quoted was 1575 per kilogram of the bike, at 15 kg, the total of Rs 23625 was quoted, which is around 300€ for a 45 min flight which I had booked for Rs 2500. For the sake of comparison, air France quoted 100€ for the Delhi Paris flight. Keep in mind that I had no check-in luggage.

So, here I was with my bicycle, with almost a week's preparation and I could not take it along.
It's just sad to see how inconsiderate the service is. It's sad that this is my review of my country's flag bearing airline."

Even the on board staff were pleasant. Plane was comfortable with plenty of leg space while the meal was hot but no choice of veg/ non veg. However I have no objection to that as its preferable to paying exorbitant prices for substandard food.
The main problem with Air India, in my view, is their inability to stay on schedule. At Bengaluru, boarding was on time and so was pushback. However we arrived in Kolkata almost 45 minutes late. Air India must address this issue of delayed flights."

And this time, we were mentally prepared. But, they must improve! They have to maintain time. It is not difficult. They have to change the mindset. Next, they have to simplify systems. Just because they are overmanned, they need not put people on unnecessary activities. We observed one of such things during our flight. At the boarding point, one person was tearing off the counterfoil from the ticket [many airlines have done away with this, some airlines just scan the bar code], then he handed it over to another person, a third person was noting down something. We were allowed inside the plane only after the whole process was over. So, there was a long queue. Similarly, the process inside the plane was slow. Agility was missing.

1. When it's time to do web check in (if you are willing to do a seat selection), it's SITA PSS website will be down.

2. Finally if you see the Web-Check in working, it won't let you do so because its web check in portal say that your passport (with validity of up to 10 years, which was 
 issued a month ago) is not valid travel.

3. You never know when will you board the flight. Once I boarded 1:45 AM flight at 9:30 am. No apologies by Airline, they don't care even if you humiliate them by running rallies and shouting slogans at the airport. You will never be asked for any food/water/accommodation. You will never be given any reason for delay or any facility that other airlines provide in these scenarios.

4. Customer care service is disgusting. When you dial the number, you will be informed that your turn will come in 10 minutes. That 10 minutes could go up to 90 minutes and still you won't get a chance to speak to customer service.

5. It is very common that Vegetarian Food gets over on the flight even if you had opted for a Vegetarian food. You will be kept hungry on the flight. If you get lucky, you may get some food. Air hostess will say that you are getting food from their share.

6. Bathrooms are mostly clogged. You won't feel like using the bathroom.

7. Seats have horrible situation. You won't be able to push it back ward.

8. Headphones won't work and Touchscreen won't turn on."

The seat tray was sticky with red wine stain and the blanket had a (blood?) stain on it. There was toilet paper all over the bathroom floor as soon as the seat belt sign was switched off after take-off. I felt like the plane hadn't been cleaned properly before boarding (maybe as I was in the back row). The food was pretty awful, served in kindergarten-like plastic boxes.

A couple of weeks later, I needed to change my return flight segment. As I was several hours from an Air India office I tried to call their international office. Each time the automation said the line was very busy and I would wait around 10 mins. I spent over 4 hours trying to change my flight during 4 calls. I waited 60 mins on one occasion and then, having explained what I wanted, was transferred to another number with more waiting. When I tried to pay for the fare change, I was told this was not possible whilst calling using Skype - so I had to start all over again. I bought phone credit and £15 vanished without being able to speak to anyone.

It was like being back in the dinosaur age of air travel. I was not able to change the reservation online, only use this call centre number. One agent alone was not able to handle a simple ticket change. There was no information about real wait time, or how payment could be accepted. When I asked to speak with a manager, I spoke to someone who had no idea how to handle customer complaints.

I received an online feedback form about the flight, but it was so basic I couldn't even leave details about the cleanliness of the plane.

Perfect, or so I thought. Then on 28th May they changed the flight connections to 45 mins in New Delhi. It is not possible to do a transfer in less than 1 hour and 30 mins!! I emailed Customer Services at Air India to see if they would honour the connection. No reply!!
The flights were later put back to the original timings. Happy days or so I thought. Then on 2nd July they changed the timings again to 45 mins transfer. Bear in mind I am flying on the 8th July!! I emailed Customer Services marking it Urgent and yup, you guessed rightly, no reply. I then phoned them and you can forget the "" you are in a queue and will be answered in 10 mins"" etc. I tried time and time again with one time over an hour and still no reply!!

After being complaint and shouted by a brave lady (bravo to her); all the staffs march out like an ant out of nowhere and fill the counters. Its little but to late as most of the passengers are in hurry/rush.

The staff (a man) who did check-in said' gate number hasn't assign yet and didn't provide the boarding gate number contradicting his own words where he said, 'it's late for boarding!'

So three flights with Air India this week then.   Really poor food, and I mean poor.  Urinal blocks in the sinks, sagging chair cushioning, threadbare upholstery and malfunctioning seat recline mechanisms.
 If you are used to flying on one of the more top notch major airlines or simply from a civilised country and are used to being comfortable don't bother flying Air India. It will disappoint..."

Like many others, I was skeptical based on the reviews online. I read many before flying the airline but unfortunately was unable to select my own airline since this was a business trip. Overall, I had a pleasant experience on the flight. The staff was incredible friendly and easy on the eyes which was good since the flight was nearly 17 hours.  The seats were standard so not super luxurious for the length of the flight but served their purpose. The in-flight entertainment was updated to offer multiple English movies and music. My only criticism is the lack of available WiFi on Air India flights, which I read they are working to rectify. Even the meals (which were plentiful) were tasty. I'm not sure they were distributed based on our pre-selected preferences since I was given a vegetarian meal at each round, but all were good. 

My return flight plane was slightly larger and updated. However, I did have an issue with my luggage being damaged on the return. I've contacted the Customer Service department but nothing as of yet. I purchased brand new luggage for the trip and one of my suitcases was complete destroyed on the return. Even the leather was stripped off as if the bag was caught in a machine. At least I got all my stuff, (except the games I forgot in my overhead bin). 

Overall though I'd say it was a successful flight with no real issues. Definitely exceeded my expectations based on the reviews I read prior to departing."

Next I found that my in flight entertainment was not  functioning, The woman sitting next to me said hers was not functioning either. When we brought this problem to the attention of the flight attendant, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. It wasn't easy to get the attention of the flight attendants either. They spent most of their time seated on stools in the galley talking and laughing with each other. We were offered water by the attendants only with food service, although the flight from SFO to Delhi was 16 + hours long. The Indian food wasn't all that good either, rather overcooked and dried out around the edges.  The Indian woman sitting next to me didn't eat hers. On the flight back my in flight entertainment was also not working. Although this time there was no garbage stuck between the seat and the window, at some point during the flight I felt a strange object between my seat and the person next to me. It turned out to be the bare foot of the woman behind me. That woman and her family appeared to be sick and coughed throughout the trip spewing spittle over me, and my food when I was eating, for the entire trip. My request to the flight attendant to ask the woman and her family to cover their faces when coughing received no response. "

The knee room in Air India is the max amongst most airlines. However the service is most atrocious, in fact worse than low cost airlines. No food or beverage, water only if asked for repeatedly. Add to that the very poor quality of announcements and delayed flight, what you get is a disaster of an experience. Further, no urgency on part of the staff. So, my advice is don't pay anything extra to travel by air India. If it's cost competitive, you may go for it."

If you fly via them, the trip to Dharamsala is either free or costs a pittance AND you get to take your whole 30kg of luggage. IF you fly another airline, you will have to purchase another ticket to Dharamsala, (who wants 12-15 hrs of lugging your luggage around if it can be done for free and you get there in 1.5 hours), then,  you will pay extra baggage over 20kg. so when I want to go to the mountains, I always fly Air India. (food is better from your home town to india than return) (but by then you will be used to it all). if that doesnt make sense....= air india will give you a free flight to dharamsala (or nearly free), and you can take all your luggage. If you fly another airline, you pay another ticket to fly to Dharamsala and you will end up paying extra baggage over 20kg.

Flights were on time and the food was reasonably Ok. The major concerns were the comfort of seat, were you have no cushions, and the entertainment was horrible, the remotes were broken, and the touch screens has no response, and more over you have to live with the very few movies (10-15 hindi and english, regional languages are 2-3, that too at least 5 years old). I do not think of sitting in a plane for 15 hours with out any entertainments? The staff has the same attitude that they had 15 years ago, nothing has changed. I could see the screws fallen off from the seats. Toilets are not having any required stuff, no soap, tissue papers or creams to wash your hands, most of the toilets are not at all cleaned! 
The ground staff at all scanning places are the worst especially, in Delhi, long queues and they just chat each other, never bothered to look at the bags that are piled on the conveyer. There was only one scanner for the entire people standing in queue! International area you have ask for help, absolutely no proper sign boards, and all your english questions are answered in HINDI, I felt pity for the Americans traveling through Delhi airport (unless they start learning Hindi). But you can lavishly enjoy the beautiful airport and the food from different states, that is well appreciated."

We had flown down to Cochin in economy on a brand new Boeing 787, which was clean and the economy experience was fine. On check in for the return flight in Cochin we were offered an upgrade to Business for half the normal cost and decided to pay the £75 as it was quite a long flight. The upgrade supposedly entitled us to priority boarding, business class seating and service on board and priority luggage delivery on arrival. The boarding was a complete shambles with no control over the order in which passengers boarded. The Business cabin ( on an A320) was absolutely filthy - I have never seen an aircraft in such a disgusting state in over 50 years of air travel ( see photo of our overhead panel below).  On board service was ‘perfunctory’ with poor food sloppily served. The cabin crew made no attempt to make the so-called Business class passengers welcome or well looked after. On arrival we were directed to a ‘special’ luggage carousel for priority luggage. The only thing that was special was that the luggage failed to appear. After 40 minutes of fruitless questions to disinterested staff I found the carousel onto which the ‘non-priority’ luggage from our flight had been delivered. Most passengers had their bags when the so-called priority baggage finally appeared around an hour after we had landed. Attempts to complain were met with ‘buck passing’ and a suggestion to speak to the duty manager in the Air India desk in arrivals. This I tried to do only to be fobbed off with the answer ‘complain through the website’. I was then detained by the police for being in a departure area without a ticket for a departure that day! You really couldn’t make it up. I will never fly Air India again and I offer this not as a criticism of India generally (it is a wonderful country), but solely of Air India. Even BA back to London felt like 6* luxury by comparison with the Air India shambles."

I was traveling for work and didn't book the flight myself, but in the future I will be much more involved in the selection of airline.  Bottom line if you don't have time to read any further: avoid this airline at all costs. I can't really begin to express how sub-par (miserable, really) the experience was, from the brusque flight crew, to the worn out and stained seats that offer no support, to the clunky and antiquated ""interactive"" screens to the horrible food. I might have been able to forgive all that if only they offered wifi on board. They do not, and apparently there is no pre-booking notice to travelers about this deficiency. I flew SFO-DEL round trip, which is a 16 hour non-stop flight each way. Not having wifi meant I lost two full days of productivity. Nothing in terms of the price of the ticket can compensate for that. I mentioned my dissatisfaction to a colleague, and learned that they are actually worse on domestic flights: ""Air India flight from Kolkata to Delhi, I was given a boarding pass with the seat number: 27C. I walked onto the plane to find that there were only 26 rows of seats on the plane! Soon there were 10 of us standing around cramped for room at the back of the plane because it turns out they had handed out boarding passes for seats in the non-existent rows 27 and 28. It took them well over an hour to sort this out and they still couldn't sort it out. After an hour of standing in that cramped space, one of the AI staff confidently hand-wrote 6F on my boarding pass. So I moved my carry on luggage from the overhead space in the back to one closer to row 6 only to find someone sitting in seat 6F and she had a boarding pass that said 6F. So I took matters into my own hands and sat down in an empty seat. Sure enough, a passenger soon showed up with a boarding pass for my seat. I directed him to the AI staff who re-seated him.""  Enough said."

Air India has the absolute worst aircrafts with the most ancient entertainment systems on International flights that really don't help in distracting you from realizing that you're trapped in a flying cupboard, at best. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey.

After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the brilliantly inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight.

Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an uncleaned seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days.

While I came out of flight and I was contended as the flight landed an hour earlier and everything was perfect till that time. Then I cleared the immigration and after that the problem started.i waited almost an hour and half for my luggage. As I had a connecting flight and my luggage along with my friend's was tagged together. My Friend received her luggage but I didn't. Then I had to report it to the missing baggage counter. My disappointment started from next day. I had to follow up for my luggage and after they finally found it,they were not courteous enough to give a call to me and inform the same. After several phone calls,the person stopped responding the call. I had to go back all the way to airport to get my luggage. After reaching there too, when asked about my bag, they staff without even checking inside told that they have not found my bag. When I told them that I will go inside and personally check my bag,one guy went and brought my bag. This clearly a case of negligence and irresponsibility. It was my first experience in Air India and probably the last too."

And Lo Behold. within few minutes, one after the other  the officers started to leave and we were left with only one officer. the lone officer was further troubled by a couple of ""family/group"" travelers who had huge number of baggage which were beyond their allowance and first they tried re-distributing the luggage and then were advised to pay for additional baggage which they found unacceptable and argued away. In the meantime the queue started lengthening and by now built up to 250 plus passengers. I had enough time but obviously there were others who had arrived just in time and were getting restive. a very many of the air India ground staff were loitering around. when i pointed out the pathetic situation all of them expressed helplessness and attempted absolutely nothing. they simply stated that it was the time when the shift change happened and the incoming staff would shortly take their charge. the few minutes of process took more than half an hour for me. As I said, I had ample time but what unnerved me was the apathy of the Air India ground staff. This organisation clearly has a culture where everyone is ""assured"" of their job irrespective of their insensitive approach. They know that it is the  government which is footing the bill of their salary and not the customer. Which is why the arrogance and the apathy! The tax-payers money is guzzled up by such unprofessional black-holes.!!!"

Hence he impatiently tried to cross me in the queue at which the clerk mr. francis politely requested him to wait for his chance. almost at the same time the counter to my left got free and i requested this gentleman to check-in his luggage from that counter if he was in a hurry. he thanked me and started towards it but was beaten to it by another traveller. in the ensuing confusion, the counter clerk very rudely pulled him up. the clerk chided him, stood up from his seat and lectured him for a full minute at the top of his voice. as if that was not enough, the clerk refused to check him in. i had to step in then and assertively pointed out to the the clerk that he cannot refuse services and should understand the state of mind of that gentleman as well. after some arguing, the clerk relented but did not stop his ranting. the gentleman was aghast and felt demeaned, naturally. i tried getting the name of the clerk but he wouldn't give it to me. 
one could experience a huge contrast between mr. francis who helped me and his colleague. isn't the airline responsible for such arrogant and insensitive behaviour of the personnel who actually are supposed to help the customers???"

First, the flight was delayed as the airlines wanted to get more customers from other connecting flights. Second, Flight attendants were swamped because of the previous issue so weren’t able to help customers with their seatings; most people were talking to other passengers that they were on their seats. Third, in New Delhi we were told by the airport staff that our flight was moved forward so they needed to get us through check ASAP. As we didn’t know any better, we followed them; one of the older passenger was asked to sit in a wheelchair so as to speed up the check in process. As we get through the check, which would have taken us no more than half an hour but was done in 15minutes, the staff member starts harassing us for pounds and 1000 Indian rupees tip. At this point we were all confused so I go straight to customer help desk to ask if the flight was moved forward, the advisor says it’s on schedule and nothing was changed. I find this disgraceful as passengers don’t necessarily have the correct information and are highly likely to trust he airport staff if they say we have to rush as flights have been changed.

Last but not the least, we all arrive in Kathmandu but our luggage hasn’t. The Kathmandu airport staff say that there was a mix up at Heathrow and should arrive by late afternoon the next day. Our contact details were taken; luckily I had phone number of a local person in Kathmandu, now my question is what if a passenger did  not know anyone in Kathmandu or had the right contact details to provide them, what happens then?

Obviously my luggage doesn’t arrive for another 2 days. At this point I have had to buy fresh underwear and other essentials as all my belongings were in my checked in luggage. Now my girlfriend found that Indian Airlines provides compensation to passengers if it’s delayed for more than 48 hours which I go to claim twice but to no avail."

Here the best part, among the Domestic Flights in India only AirIndia allows 25kg checkin luggage and 7kg hang carry. It’s worth it rather than 12-15 kilos on other flights and secondly only AirIndia goes to the International Airport in Mumbai. It’s best if you’re traveling out of India and need a domestic flight to carry more luggage.

We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8:40 in the morning to 2:40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights  (actually al 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online checkin was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 Minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT ... you don´t believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn´t work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerious resets to get the minimum going- the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems . This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems.
So at least for us: never AIR INDIA again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. it is a shame that they are a member of the star alliance group."

I decided to call them, because the connecting flight was planned 20 minutes after arrival in Kolkata. Oh that’s not working they said. They can reroute me on the flight at 8:00 am. Ok now I have to wake up at 4 am, but ok. If no other choice...
Next message came, Sorry the flight from Kolkata to Dhaka also delayed now by one hour.
Than I called again to book me back on the first flight, because time seems enough now. But that one was ful in the meantime.
So I arrived in Kolkata early with the result that I could not go inside, because immigration starts only 3 hours before the flight. Finally I have to sit nearly 8 hours at the dirty and crowdy airport in Kolkata. Cancelled meetings. A ful day lost.
Ok it can happen, that a flight must be cancelled. But from other airlines I get a good and helpful service normally, especially if you book a expensive business class ticket.
But air India: no. They just always said, that is the best we can do... means nothing!
It is not the first time the trouble with them and I saw on the board, around half of there flights were either delayed or cancelled. 
Seems they drive now the same policy as Air Berlin, shortly before they bancrupt: if the flights not ful, they will cancel some and move the passengers to other flights to save money.
I really wonder that such a airline can be member of star alliance!

Attendants were very rude as my son was having a bag with 2 books and we were sitting in exit row. they allowed all the way but on landing, they told him to put bag up or change the seat and very rude in communicating.he was only 14 years old brought up as USA citizen, never experienced such a communication.
finally iam flying since 1994 at least every year to different destination never missed a bag , we missed this time.
But bag was recovered and delivery guys wanted us to collect at some fire station, telling different stories that house address not able to locate and roads were blocked which was a lie, when we told the to take back, finally they delivered after 12 hours from initial conversation.
will never fly again, used air india in 2000 was bad  , again tried in 2019, no better  .
Booked through air eagle, sent a email to that flight timing will be changed , called them has to wait for 1/2 hour to get them and never gave any option and told them to change timings.
will never fly again."

We were told by the Rome check-in operative that our luggage would be transferred at Delhi and we wouldn't need to handle the luggage there. Furthermore,  he told us that we only had to go to the departure gate and not to the transfer desk. He couldn't have been more wrong!

On arrival at Delhi, we had our visas checked and followed the signs for Domestic Transfers/ Baggage Pickup.  As we were passing the luggage belts we decided to see if our luggage had been accidentally (or otherwise) put on the belt. Lo and behold it had been.  What a lucky call that had been.

We and all our bags were then directed through Customs into the Arrivals Lounge where we had to check-in our luggage again. 

Before checking-in, we had a wonderful coffee at Costa Coffee where we ripped the luggage labels off off the suitcases so the baggage handlers wouldn't get confused. Big mistake!

At the Domestic Transfer desk we told the clerk about the misinformation from the Rome Air India desk and how we nearly lost our luggage.  He wasn't interested.  When we told him that other futere passengers from Rome needed to be given the correct International to Domestic transfer procedure, he gave us the Air India web address. 

We put our bags on the belt and off the went to near oblivion.  Fortunately the clerk noticed the lack of labels  and berated us for taking them off, 'Don't you know the transfer procedure? '

"2019-08-20T00:42:09-04:00","1","review","3","Never ever again!!!!","Never ever try this airline, for the first time tried it and it's the worst decision I've ever made.

I travel at least 4 countries a year and 've traveled in low cost latin american airlines and european airlines but I am surprised that the flagship carrier of India from the most popular hub in USA was the worst flight I've ever experienced.

Before boarding, there is an option to book your seat and to your surprise at the check in , the agent changes the seat, though its the same flight, meaning the seating structure did not change and its not a new flight or different from what's shown when you booked the ticket. This happened not only with me but other passengers as well, so I wonder why they even give an option to book seat when passengers can't retain them.

The flight is quite older in fact oldest and there are no standards for restrooms, in fact, public restrooms in India appeared more hygenic and cleaner than those on this flight. 

There was some smell in cabin which is expected for long flights , so usually it's a common practice for airlines like Qatar and Emirates to fill the cabin with air freshners before the flight takes off and when I asked for some air fresheners, Air India staff said they don't do it and dont ask me why :-)

Coming to entertainment, lets just assume , there is none. No one knows when the touch screens work and when they won't. From the media collection, hardly any good movies and most of them don't play, so, it's almost like there is no entertainment at all.

No maps are shown on the monitors, and with seat monitors not functioning,   you would not have any idea on where you are or when you are going to land or how much of the flight time is remaining, you always have to wait for announcements from captain.

Above all, what surprised me most is that, it's a full flight, so, even with such high revenue why Air India is not focused on bringing some better service to this route.

Hopefully they will work on it, if not, I am sure, in no time, they will have to fly empty planes."

"2019-08-18T23:43:01-04:00","1","review","1","Worst experience-","Information and customer service does not exist with this Airline. 
My flight to London to Mumbai was diverted to Delhi with apparent problems on the runway due to weather and because of another airline overshot the runway the previous night. This was aware of this problem  even before it departed from London but we were only told  only half an hour before we were about to land that the flight is now being diverted to Delhi. Another 2.5 hours flight. Upon Landing at Delhi we were told that once Mumbai clears we will fly back. After 2 hours in the aircraft on the ground they  decided we will all have to disembark  and make alternative arrangement to our destination.
We were taken to the terminal a very small briefing by one of the staff who did not even have the courtesy wait for all the passengers as some of us were still trying to get our baggage. To re-route our flight they a two staff serving  350 passengers.
As there is no queuing system you can imagine what a nightmare it was.
During all this time no courtesy services were offered by the Airline .
Even when departing from Goa to Mumbai my flight was delayed due to bad weather,
the flight was to depart at 18.30 hrs , all other domestic airlines were announcing the departure of there flight well before the departure time . Air India announces delay in departure exactly at  18.30 .
This Airline really needs to improve its services and mentioning in flight entertainment
its a joke half the equipment on flight does not work, even connection of headset missing. I was told by the inflight attendance that they have reported it several times but the management just ignores their comments.

Talking to people  they all say my experience is not unique, don't take things for granted when flying Air India."

I will try to objectively list everything that is wrong with this flight. I am a heavy person, 15 kilo overweight 187 cm height. 

I paid 200 dollars less than Qatar Airways for the same journey. Below you can see if it was worth it.

Plus points:
1) Acceptable service. I always got help on the flight, though not making me feel cared.
2) 2 check in bags of 23 kilos

Minus points:
1) You can check in 48 hours before your flight. Why do we do that? To select meal and seat - for a long journey. I tried to navigate their horrible webpage for check in. It is hidden somewhere. After you get there, you have a drop down menu to choose start city. Stockholm not listed! Looked everywhere else, and by chance after 3 hours somewhere saw a text entry ""If checking in from Stockholm, click here"" Takes you to SAS webpage where nothing happens, booking reference is invalid.
2) Tried checkin through phone app. Asks to create an account, cannot use Star Aliance membership. Then add trip. Then try checking in -- some java programming error.
3) Tried calling call centres. There are 100 options and when to call whom. Not one number! None of them work. Spent another 10 pounds on this and 2.5 hours.
4) 4th attempt, calling directly to a Delhi call centre, I got some person who spoke out of a script and had to yell to get a check in possibility. She blocked my seat over the phone. 35K, apparently a window seat.
5) Got to airport, kiosks do not work for boarding pass. ARN airport personnel just heard ""Air India"" and sent me to a counter chuckling that it never works.
6) Checked my seat at check in counter, they gave me both middle seats. They said call centre had put in a request for seat change. Follow up comment in their system was ""seat denied"". Reason the lady said --  ""flight is fully booked"". Try at the gate.
7) Went to gate. Asked for 35K. They said, flight is booked. I can still give you 39D -- window. I took it. Came and checked seat map -- right next to toilet and last row, less leg room than even usual seats! Went back and asked, they said ""we have one seat left 37 D"" somehow ""one seat""s kept appearing.
8) Flight started off 10 min late -- reason: ""they forgot some paperwork""
9) Flight had 2 seats per person. Nowhere close to fully booked.
10) I changed around a few seats and somehow settled on an emergency exit seat! My luck! But the entertainment monitor kept breaking down and had to be reset 6 times.
11) I changed 4 seats because of one problem or another. Apparently the last row is for the crew! So they can sleep? when has this been the norm? Was asked to get up and leave
12)  The plane was dirty, old head rest covers, oil and food on the arm rests, windows and on the back of seats, old napkins..yuck!
13) The crew were all dressed in different colours, looked like they had just gotten off 2 other back to back journeys just before coming to us. The people looked ugly and more like ""service men"" waiting to cater to every whim of every passenger (Indian passengers are really exploitative!). They commanded no respect, there was no aura of control or neatness or respect with any of them, except one.
14) Food was imported from UK. Horrible food. They have removed salad and bread, downsizing the meal. The quality of the rice and the curry itself was horrible. I would not eat that even if I were hungry and on a plane..... wait, I was! Yeah gave it back half eaten.
15) Had to pick up bag at Delhi airport, where they kept displaying ""Last bag on belt"" which made the people confused and panic for a terribly long time.
16) Had to go through some underground bunker for checking in to domestic flight to Bangalore. Hot humid, packed, crying children, confusion. Luggage specialists being the kings of queues and laws in that room. Random instructions and rules, to show that they are powerful. A 4 man elevator to transport people after check in to security check, for a 200 people flight!
17) Bangalore flight was late by 30 minutes, sitting on the tarmac, no explanation to passengers.
18) Horrible toilets on both flights, not maintained, not stocked with supplies. Indians already have horrible toilet etiquette, if they do not maintain some vigil, there will be a splatter of poop on the toilet seat, like I saw. Learn something from Bangalore airport toilet crew! Idiots...
19) Horribly placed head rests which cause a neck pain. they cannot be moved up or down really.
20) Not enough blankets or pillows. Crew just say ""that is all you can get/ go check at your seat and come back"". On the other hand,there are sacks of pillows and blankets in the over head compartments, taking up room so that hand bags cannot be stored!

Now.. I think I have said everything here that made me never want to travel on this airline again. I was so happy with this service when it started almost exactly 2 years ago and have been using it since then! I think the company, running under loss, is underpaying their staff and downsizing their service quantity and quality still trying to maintain a facade of regalia of the Maharaja. But the Maharaja has long departed and his paper cut out stands there bowing to us, maybe in shame?"

Also, I have travelled by Air India several times and I have faced technical issues or flight delays almost all the time.
The only reason I travel by Air India is that this is the only direct flight from Vienna to Delhi which also allows 2 pieces of baggage with allowed limit of 23kg per piece. Apart from this baggage allowance, there is nothing good about Air India that I can mention here. Also reaching out to customer service team at Air India is a real pain as you may sometimes end up with a wait time of 30 minutes before you finally get to speak to a customer care executive via phone."

Also, watch  the weight as the scales at check in were wrong - they added at least 1.5kg to the bag. The check in guy was kind enough to waive the excess fees for our one bag that was 2kg over. Nothing much to see/do at Jaipur airport as it is fairly small. Flight was ok, no inflight entertainment. Small bottle of water and 2 small cookies given as a snack. 
From Udaipur airport to the city is a 45 minute drive - the first taxi company you come across on the way out wanted 1400 INR to the centre of town. The second company is the pre paid taxi company and they asked for 750 INR but we got an Uber for 520 INR."

They can cancel your booking without any notice after the booking is confimed.","I booked a flight of Air India on Jun 2 between Male  and Bangalore for my family of 5 through their website and they sent me a confirmation email after the booking was completed.
I thought everything was fine and I planned some appointments at Bangalore on that day.
I checked my flight booking through their website 5 days before the boarding date (Aug 7) and found the booking was cancelled without any notice to me. I asked Air India what was happened and they answered they had some payment settlement trouble and they cancelled the booking.
I asked them to resume the orginal booking again and showed willingness to make the payment again because,
1. The booking was once confirmed.
2. They did not send me any notice about booking cancellation.
3. The payment trouble was not my fault.

They admitted my claim was true, but what they said was just to make a new booking. Making new booking costed me more than double (almost triple) and seemed to me quite ridiculous. 
I asked them again to resume the booking, but they did not show me any additional solutions nor any apology about their procedure and I was kept ignored just like I was an evil claimer.

I am a frequent traveller and I have been made flight ticket booking hundreds of times. This is first time that once confirmed booking is cancelled by an airline company without prior notice or cumtomer's consent. 

In conclusion, my reccomendation is to avoid using arrogant and unflexible Air India. Use Indigo and Spicejet.

On top of everything else, the airline (like the other airlines in India) have very limited baggage allowances on domestic flights, so you are forced to pay excessive excess baggage fees, if you are a foreign tourist traveling from overseas! Whereas you might arrive in the country with the typical allowance of 46 kg (two 23 kg bags), once you arrive you are suddenly expected to lose 21 kg of luggage (with their 25 kg baggage allowance) or pay the equivalent of 7 USD per kg, in excess fees! I ended up paying in the course of 3 domestic flights, more than 160 USD in excess fees, more than the cost of all 3 plane tickets, combined!

If you wanted anything to eat or drink (food was inedible) you had to wait until someone came past as the buzzer did not work. The breakfast we were offered was a dry piece of cake, something that resembled a croissant (which I chose) or a chocolate muffin. I took one bit of the croissant and spat it out it was revolting. We went for 10 hours without being offered a meal and when I asked for one, it was like ""seriously you want some service"" attitude. When we reached Delhi we were forced to go through a baggage with the nastiest individuals it was a full search even though we were just transiting. Now I am not talking about the usual search  when you get to or near your gate and you are asked to open you bag, I am talking ""take everything out of your back pack, asked about every object in in, having the goods snatched from me and thrown into a plastic bucket to go through the scanner. The goods were literally  snatched from me, I was then asked to step behind a curtain to be scanned by one of the most miserable people I have ever met, actually being pushed to move into the ""correct position"" without exchanging one word with me. When I came out, I was asked to pack my bag (its contents had been piled into one plastic sorter even though 3 went through when I unpack and was told to move out of the way, at this point I did not realise that 3 pieces of my luggage missing (I was literally shaking & in tears)  2 evening bags and a soft packing bag all of which contained my jewellery (I always carry it with me) I didn't see this until I arrived home and started to unpack. I then quickly rang both the airline and the airport they gave me 6 different numbers ""as they were not responsible for lost and found albeit that the dept I rang"" - I am still waiting on a response after I was finally given an email address to send my query to. I have now lost precious air-looms that cannot be replaced and about $4K worth of additional jewellery. Not only will I never travel with them again, I will be taking this up with the Indian embassy. My advice, if you are traveling alone or a Female don't go near them. I booked it because it was a last minute trip to Europe and they were the carrier bringing me back from Milan. On the trip over the first leg was with Malaysian airlines who you never expect a lot from but they are friendly and accommodating, The second leg was with Oman Airlines and I have to say they are one of the best I have ever been on. The beds are comfortable, you are given a complete privacy screen they come and ask you constantly if you need anything and it was pristine. Absolutely no comparison. If I am able to use Oman airlines for a full journey in the future I wouldn't hesitate to book. I have been distraught about my Jewellery since Saturday and there has been no follow up they didn't even ask my name, what flight I was on what seat I was in...! It was only on Sunday when I happened across someone what seemed like they were will to help but the email they gave me bounced back, I have tried a slightly different permutation and it did not bounce back so I am sitting in abeyance not knowing if any action will be taken. I know that the insurance company will ask if I have contacted them before they will take action however I actually don't know. 
Long and drawn out review as I really think forewarned is forearmed so if you want to travel cheap and are will to accept the fact that you should be grateful to even get a seat then try your luck, if you want a business class experience you won't get it on this airline."
"2019-08-07T14:49:31-04:00","2","review","0","The airline has no business being in business particularly in Business Class","I have flown Air India on two different occasions over the last two years both as a consequence of a last minute emergency that left the airline as the only choice to fly to and from India (my regular choice is United or Lufthansa).  

First the ""good points"". On both occasions, the cabin crew provided excellent service and are always eager to please which is in stark contrast to many US airlines where the idea of service is an alien concept thanks to the employee unions in the US who think customers and owners are secondary to a business.  However, it is all downhill from here as the crew can only do so much with aircraft that belong to a third world country (at least in this regard India is not one with Indigo and the erstwhile Jet Airways prove).

The negatives:  Let's start with the lounge in JFK:  A tiny room with a comically roped off part for ""first class"" has a damp air with an overpowering smell of overcooked Indian food that has been left to stew on chaffing dishes. The TVs in the room are from a few decades ago with couches strewn about haphazardly leaving travelers (business class) to trip over each while they balance food from the ""buffet"" on their hands in trying to get to the couches.  

Now the lounge in New Delhi: Set to one side at the upper level of the international departure area it has a desk manned (at least in this instance) by a mostly Hindi speaking semi-gruff individual who could barely string two sentences in English (despite the noise from all those strident Hindi proponents, it is by no means spoken across the India and is not their national language). Anyway, once past Mister Charming, a similar stale buffet of Indian food in an admittedly larger area awaits. The lounge seating too is more spread out but with furniture that someone put there a decade ago and forgot to replace. Getting from the lounge to the boarding gate requires clearing another security hurdle apparently per US regulations only to find a long wait.  The perhaps in a revenge of the proletariat the airline decides that Economy passengers are should board first! That left the paying seething! Incidentally, there are more non-paying passengers than paying! Ah! the thrills of working for an employer with an endless capacity for deficit financing! 

Lastly the business class cabin: It actually is very spacious but with an ante-diluvian configuration of 2-3-2. In the middle 3 abreast seats a tiny fan can be raised for privacy! Can't make it up!. Once in the seat, nothing works. Well almost nothing as the seat does recline a full 180 degrees but that's it. 

The video ""entertainment"" is and has been kaput for years as evidenced by the two flights over the last two years. The staff gamely tries to fiddle with it when asked knowing fully well it does not work!  Then again, they are very service oriented even if they have been given nothing to work with.  

There are no amenity kits although a pair of slippers is provided. Toothbrushes and paste are in the toilets and presumably replenished when over.   

The food is shamefully tasteless given how tasty Indian food can be. Worse, on AI 101 DEL-JFK, they offered a ""snack"" on take off and work up passengers about 4 hours later to offer dinner when most passengers were deep in slumber! 

Lastly, the actual seats were worn out with one in front (see photo) actually having a screw sticking out! I guess suing Air India for any injury that may ensue is not an option."

We were supposed to travel with Air India again, when returning to Mumbai. The flight was again more hours delayed - which we were informed about while waiting for security check. This meant for us that we weren't able to catch our connecting flight in Mumbai. We asked the staff from Air India for help, but they didn't do anything to help us. After hours of diskussion, they finally agreed to refund some of the ticket, but no help otherwise. Afterwards we called and wrote to Air India asking for compensation for some of all the extra costs we had, but nobody seemed to know anything and we never got any compensation - or answers on any of the email we sent.
Flights can be deleayed, but the lack of service and assistance is beyond anything we've ever tried. They didn't seem to care at all. We will never choose Air India again.

Their checkin counters at SFO intermittently man the business line, and the economy agents don't care to get somebody to help. Entertainment system didn't work on multiple trips. No separate boarding for business. They board economy before business. Ah the lounge in Delhi. Lounges have no towels for shower. Lounge family bathroom had no soap, no paper towels, no hand dryer. Lounge coffee machine is broken. Lounge has mosquitoes. There were pigeons pecking on leftover food on the ground. No drinks service except on first meal. On the way back, they reassigned seat because apparently assigned seat didn't recline, and they put me and children on different rows. Threw a stink so they moved around already seated passengers to accommodate me finally --- literally had to threaten to not sit. ""Priority"" tag on bags mean nothing at baggage claim.

Listen up very carefully --- if anything goes wrong with your flight, they will not comp  you. The staff *may* help you out of the love of their own heart but that's it. It WILL be daylight robbery. This airline is really an Indian taxpayer funded shuttle service for Government of India employees travelling free on business. A very expensive shuttle service, completely unaccountable to the taxpayer, just the way the rest of the Indian government is. You could be any passenger, business, first, you are just a sideshow. Lol. The airline doesn't care. If you don't travel again, they don't care.

Air India tickets are available on early dates at low rates, but at the end moment they have canceled out their direct flight flights. They have provided an alternate route which became harassment for all of us, need to visit their office multiple times.

During travel day their flight got delayed for a couple of hours which is usual for Air India. After enquiring we came to know that they were searching for a pilot. I didn't know how to react on that at that situation(should I laugh or angry on their stuff)

Check in at Bangalore was fine, courteous staff and immigration was smooth and quick. Reached New Delhi a little late but that was fine. 
 Delhi was where the nightmare began. Multiple security checks were done, alright, it's for our own good. But on the aircraft and after take-off ,to our dismay we discovered, the seats don't recline properly, the TV and remotes don't work. This meant that we couldn't even ask the stewards to help. 
Both of us are way past 60, so we do need a bit of comfort but a few hours of discomfort later we decided to ask for some relief. To our dismay the stewards were most unhelpful. Khushboo, obviously a young and maybe less experienced stewardess, told us that we had asked for these seats deliberately, hoping for an upgrade. I found this to be the rudest answer ever, we didn't even talk of an upgrade, just for someone to fix the seats and the TV. We both read, so the TV was not really an issue. But the remote is necessary to summon the staff. 
When we finally lost our temper, the staff apologised but frankly did nothing. 
Food was served very late. Service is shoddy. All we wanted was some courtesy and cooperation, but really air India needs to get its act together. 
We are planning to cancel our return ticket and fly by Emirates. Their economy class is way better than business class here. 
I strongly recommend that people planning to fly Air India for any reason, please don't. It's not worth your money. And our pride in our national carrier just took a massive nosedive."

I needed to share this review with someone from Air India. You need to take a serious look at your lounge especially Delhi being one of your major hub. This is your front for the airlines. Your lounge is too inferior and not reflective of your airline. Please take a look at your food offfering. Apart from stale and only Indian food (i like Indian food but the quality is bad) you have no other choices except flies. Your staff are totally inadequate and on their phone all the time. No passion for their job. On the many occasions I have been there, I would eat at the restuarants and even the other lounges which are of a way better quality. So if you are from AI, please do something about this for your airline and for Indian pride at least.

Finally, I have good things to say about the flight itself. Whilst not anywhere near Singapore Airlines, Air India's J class is comfortable. Seats are wide enough but everything else fails - seat maintainence is bad, entertainment is also inadequate and inflight service needs some serious motivation. They all look unhappy. So please do improve."

2. I don’t see update on website regarding delay.Even after trip end it t is showing the original times.This is just a common sense. People will be looking for status of flights to plan pick up for loved ones.

3.My opinion next time even if it is 100$ costly I willl go for other service .The only reason for choosing air India is senior citizens will have some companion in the trip.

Please improve the service.."

They do not have callback facility. All I am doing is waiting and nothing else. Pathetic service, I would never ever travel with Air India in my life. I had to travel with AI just because Stupid united airline got cancelled and they made arrangement with AI. Air India shall stop the service, they are not eligible to be in the business."

Why can't they exit flying?","First of all I am sure nothing will happen to my this review as far as AI is concerned. On a flight to Singapore on19th July( AI 342), can one imagine the aircraft they fly does not have a place for the customers to keep their specs, mobile phones etc. Seats have no pockets. I sat like a statue for 5.5 hours with my mobile and wallet in my 2 hands as there was no space (like net/pocket in back of the seat in front of me). While such aircrafts( A320 or 321) are ok to fly domestic, how can AI do so for international routes. Can anyone reply where does one keep small belongings such as the ones I mentioned here? There site/portal is horrible. Their local phone connections in Singapore are most terrible. Why are they in this business when they are nor even making money? as for myself, I will not even not fly again, I also feel like asking all my friends also not to fly AI.
For Business class upgrade, they ask you to pay money first and they will, then, confirm later. Can you imagine when? They confirm at the time of boarding.Then why do they take money days in advance for the upgrade. Is anybody in govt aware of this 'loot'?"

We have seen multiple people alone and the flight from Delhi had way more than 40 people boarding. They lie in front of your face.

That's another story. The main problem is the management of the counters. The queue was so long that people were spilling out of the line barricades. There must have been at least 8 or 9 smaller line queues. To add to the woes was the fact that only 2 counters were operational with staff taking more than 10 minutes per passenger!!!!

After complaints from many passengers, they opened another counter. Air India is hopeless when it comes to customer support. Mumbai terminal T2 is international but my experience has always been chaotic at T2.

In the aircraft, there was moist smell, some seats were torn or wearing off, legroom in economy is less, so no complaint because I had booked in economy. The airlines should manifest professionalism in their actions."

My last name changed when I got married therefore my new passport has my married name. For some reason they would not accept the passport and my marriage certificate as a proof of that. My Indian visa is on my maiden name. I tried to reason with them that the US government takes security seriously and that they issued my new passport, drivers license, social security card etc. only after verifying everything. The airline demanded that I produce a court document showing name change - I dont have a court document nor does any one that I know. That is not what we do in the US for marital name change. They refused to let me get on the airplane with this reason. I was literally travelling to India for two days to attend to a family emergency and I couldn't make it. The worst part is the way the Air India staff in JFK treated me. One would expect that they would try and help the passenger but the person incharge - ""Mr. Gupta"" was extremely rude and treated me like I was not human.

My earlier flight had got cancelled so I booked Air India flight at 1:30pm, (scheduled departure 04:25pm, boarding time 03:50pm) directly from the airport. Gate number wasn't mentioned on the information boards. It just showed flight status ""On time"". No one from the airport information desk had any update from Air India. There was only 1 Air India personnel (who we had to search for almost 20 mins- found him at 04:00pm) who told us that expected gate of arrival is 41A. We ran towards the gate which was almost 15 minutes distance from the information desk, only to find NOTHING. Many of my co-passengers thought the flight has already left the gate and is on the runway waiting to take-off. While the information board still displayed flight status as ""On-time"". It was 05:00pm and we thought we missed the flight. We again went to the information desk and the single person who had told us about the Gate number was missing. There were many other passengers who had bought their Air India tickets (for other destinations) were waiting for answers from the airport information desk, but those employees did not have any update from Air India. Finally, at 6pm, I got a voice message saying that the flight will depart at 6:30pm, but no mention of gate details. At 6:35pm, the gate number was displayed. We all ran towards the gate, but the flight hadn't arrived yet. The plane arrived at the gate at 6:45pm, then the customary cleaning and offboarding was going on. At least at that time we knew we hadn't missed the flight. We finally boarded at 7:30pm and the flight took off at 8pm. Till the time I boarded, I was irritated with all the mismanagement. But then the in-flight experience was way better than other domestic economy flights I had traveled in. Larger leg room, cleaner interiors, free meal (even on a 40mins flight), comfortable seats. I understand the chaos that day due to rains, but Air India should have at least given some information to the passengers about the flight delays. Otherwise, the in-flight experience was the best I had so far, especially for domestic economy category."

The leg space is one of the best in the Airline industry.
They now have smart, suave, ever-smiling stewardesses and stewards.
Food variety on domestic sector, though vegetarian, the flights from Kolkata offer excellent choices, though the ones originating from Delhi lack a proper taste.
The pilots being vastly experienced, the landing operations are extra smooth.
Fantastic airline, though the successive governments are trying their best to destroy this Institution.

Firstly, among all the domestic airlines, i would strongly recommend only Air India!!! 

Air India staff takes very good care of wheelchair passengers, unlike some of the other airlines like Vistara and SpiceJet who are so least bothered and negligent in understanding passengers requirements [They are doing service as a big favor on us, too much of attitude]. Hence, i stopped travelling in Vistara and SpiceJet due to some bad experiences while taking wheelchair services for myself and parents. 

Coming back to Air India, best staff and even once you are seated on the board, the air hostesses are very kind, cheerful and helpful....Seats in the economy class are clean and spacious compared to other airlines, Good leg room with wonderful ambiance [No A/C Issue at all].

Worst of all, though, they refused to compensate us for an unforeseen overnight stay in NYC due to an unannounced change of flight plan on the way home, which made us land 7 hours late. Oh, and my husband's seat electronics didn't work either going or returning home. It's far and away the worst experience flying that I've ever had."

I needn't have been! The check in was simple, the plane was clean and comfortable and the food was fine - not the best meal ever but at least at the standard of other airlines and better than many. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the trip. The outbound flight was on time and the return landed 30 minutes early. I would never have any problems recommending Air India to others and would happily use again myself."

Had already experienced the Babudom of this airline  when I visited their Safdarjung airport office. it is no different from any other Govt. office of a District with more staff and less visitors but still a long wait before the staff will finish  desk work or phonemail to attend. I was told my FF Miles had expired and I could buy them back. These would be sufficient for upgrading me and my wife to business class. However the cost of buyback worked out to more than what I would have to pay at the check-in counter . In any case no seats were free on  our dates two/ three months later.
The flight itself was on time and our paid seats next to the door were pre booked. But little did we know that the toilets of this Dreamliner can be a nightmare as the stink was overwhelming. I could see the staff was in a bad mood as none of them ever smiled not even when a cute little kid walked in and said something very funny. My comment that such a beautiful aircraft and that too a couple of years old sadly not maintained as it stank evinced a reply that it was because of the kind of people that travel! The flight took off at about noon and lunch n drinks were promptly served. after five hours my query revealed that the next service was still two hours away however tea could be provided. three hours later  a meal /dinner was served. It had refrozen fruits, nearly frozen croissant with a hard cheese slice, a sugary dessert  alongwith tea coffee. My comment that food was unpalatable evinced the reply: You can register a complaint, I agree food is bad but this is always the case from Delhi. I did not registers obviously the airline was aware.
The flight got into terminal 2 which is different from the one they used to but there was no announcement to the effect at all. The food on the return journey was better but still not what an international airline would serve. The staff was still in a foul mood as if driving a garbage truck.One girl who came to check on why I was saying food is bad did smile and i complimented her so she told me that they are all overworked.
Overall a forgettable experience."

Taking the same flight one year later, I can see a deteoriation in the service & offer. In this review I will only comment on what has changed.
1) The plane was not fresh.Blankets, speakers, seatbelt were out of place. Washroom accessories were already used. The root cause was obviously that the turnaround time wasnt enough from the previous flight or pure indifference. Hope it was the former otherwise AI has a bigger problem.
2) Economy food is not something you look forward to but this trip AI found a way to make it even worse. Evidence of cost cutting everywhere, fewer choices on the menu, smaller portions and the breakfast ""box"" was atrocious. Surely they can do better than that and only a year back the food was better.
3) Inflight entertainment - Hasnt changed at all and is bad as it has always been I suspect !! The screens are not sensitive and need to be pushed quite strongly for any impact. Once you have managed that and get to the movies menu, old 10 yr old films that you have seen umpteen times greet you . Why bother !!
4) What hasnt changed is that the drinks cart still has good many options. Maybe there is a purpose behind this and the best thing to do is to get sozzled and sleep all the way thru. 
5) The 8 hr direct flight time and 45 kgs baggage per person are still the two main draws to fly AI on this route, especially for families. This route is popular and usually fully booked with families travelling to India for vacation. AI needs to improve the service and not make it a milch cow. Hope someone is listening."

As usual AI acts like they don't know it is coming and have a major meltdown in service when it comes.  Cancelled flights and stranded passengers are to be expected considering that Mumbai only has one runway and any weather throws off everyone. AI though knew this was coming, did not staff up for the issues and was thoroughly confused as to how to handle the issues. Cues were non existent or unenforceable. Notices of delays and gate changes were not announced properly, people were left to their own devices.  My flight departed 5 hours late and after we had been sitting in the bird for almost 2 hours. AI needs some serious Lessons Learned from the mess.  I met people who had been stranded overnight with no recourse but to hang out in the terminal upstairs which is not designed for that.  There are few places to sit, relax or eat."

The good (that stayed good) - the leg room is more spacious than we’ve learnt to live with on common commercial airliners.
The bad (really bad!) - while landing in New-Delhi, the plain literally slammed on the ground and tilted disturbingly.
The ugly (unexpectedly) - on both flights while preparing to leave the vessel, we were “awarded” with angry and in highly impolite tones expressed requests from the stewardesses to help them prepare the plain for the next trip:”I said - close the window shutter! ...

I would never do it again, despite the cheap price tag. For a start, I arrived home 28 hours late and lost more than the savings in income. The first leg of the flight was 7 hours late to take off, which meant we missed the connection. I was then told I would have to wait 20 hours for another flight, which went via melbourne - so added an extra leg and several hours on to the trip. They did put me up in a hotel - but the hot water didn't work, and there was a huge window in to the middle of the airport which the curtains didn't really block out, so it was quite a rough night. The staff in the airport were extremely unhelpful, and I doubt I would've even been on the flight I ended up going home on if I hadn't stood at the desk for more than 2 hours being persistent. The plane on the way home was filthy - old food caked on the tray tables, rubbish on the floor. When I eventually got home, my luggage had been lost! I got it back about 24 hours later - again, after a lot of persistent activity on my end. I really wouldn't recommend this flight, even if it is much cheaper than other options. "

Air India needs to invent and innovate to keep passengers involved and enjoying by showing details of why this long haul, what it implies , how much extra it costs the airline, the world and harmony. The importance of peace time . This is an opportunity to show and share India perspective of issues. And for tech savvy individuals, it is a chance to learn about aviation routes, rules and alternatives.

And to my dismay, one of the ground staff from Mumbai was sick rude. He instead of helping and attending to queries from the passenger, he was pathetically on the verge of arguments. And to make it worse, the flight I boarded from to kolkota to Dimapur was no better, one of the crew was standing beside my seat, so I politely asked him if he can help me by putting my luggage in the cabin, he looked at me and asked me to help him by lifting it up. Common it was just 5 kilo, I asked him to help me since he was standing beside my seat and I was blocking the way of the other passenger, otherwise I would have not asked him at all. If it would have been some other cabin crew member they would have helped me even without me asking them to do so. So many unpleasant incident happen within this short trip. Oh and last but not the least, the helpline kept me waiting for good 47 minutes and it would have continued if I have not dropped the call as nobody was answering, when the operator clearly told tat I would have to wait for 10 minutes inorder to speak to the executive member.

Whether it is a local or an international flight, these guys are the absolute Pitts. Your cabin crew could not give a toss. This is an airline, owned and run by civil servants. Kafka himself could not come up with how poorly you will get treated.

Cabin staff is just not interested in you. You are a nuisance to them, an inconvenience at best. Because no matter what they do, or don’t, they will still keep their cosy jobs.

AirIndia is solely kept alive to ferry around Indian politicians. Nothing else matters. They are a Star Alliance member. But they are nowhere to provide
Even basic courtesy let alone services like the Star Alliance partners typically do."

I booked this flight because my scheduled spicejet flight was unexpectedly cancelled with less than 24 hours. Anyway, that's a different story.
So I arrived at the airport fairly early for my flight, half expecting some delay of sorts. Check in was smooth, efficient. I cleared security and settled down to wait for boarding. I was expecting a delay considering it was rainy season in Goa, but nope the rain gods were happy that day, flight was on time. Boarding was a breeze and my luck was rolling. I had the whole row to myself.(I don't think a lot of people fancy a morning flight)
Breakfast at 30000 ft was good, light, not too heavy. Kudos, well done. Sometimes you just want an airline that reminds you of the good old days of air travel. Complimentary meals, complimentary seat allocation of your choice and no haggling for extra baggage charges.

CCU - BOM observations:
- Delayed 35 minutes, not really a big deal
- I paid for an upgraded seat, I was in row 5 AI boards from the rear of the plane, no overhead space when I was allowed to board.
- I have Platinum status with Star Alliance, AI did no pre-boarding of ANY kind.
BOM - EWR
- I called to ensure that my flight was going to be on time, the flight from the previous day was delayed 8 hours, I was told that my flight would be on time.
- Arrived in BOM and was told that my flight was delayed 8 hours, AI was putting me up at a local hotel.
-hotel was horrible, they required more information for checking in then the hotel that I stayed in for my 3 week trip.  They took photo copied of my passport, tickets, and took photo's.
-BOM was a nice airport
- Went through the regular security as with all passengers regardless of destination.
-AI, once again, no priority boarding for no one but the elderly which there were plenty.
- Need to go through an additional security check at the gate after having your ticket validated, this included removing shoes, removing all electronics for your carry on bags, and a second pat down.
- The plane interior was filthy, walkway carpet were sticky, seats had stains on, and just trash on the plane.
- In addition to the 8 hour delay there was an additional 1.5 hour delay.
- food was ok but flight attendants were not readily available even when they were paged.
So for a 18 hour flight (3 hours CCu - BOM and then 15 hours from CCU - EWR)  I had my lifetime fill of AI.  I would rather spend additional hours with another carrier then use AI again.  I was not familiar with AI or what their rating was but I will never fly them again, to date this is the worst Star Alliance member that I have ever traveled on.  So once and done foe me and AI."

On all flights Air India operated modern Boeing 787 ""Dreamliner"" aircraft. I love that, as an economy passenger, one can check-in two suitcases with a maximum combined weight of 46kgs (One suitcase can have a maximum weight of 30kgs). 
My flight from Birmingham in November 2017 had a slight change of the departure time which Air India communicated very early via e-mail, a text message, and a phone call. A service which I found absolutely exemplarily. 
Check-In and Boarding always went very quickly and were handled very professionally. My flight from Frankfurt was dealt with by a ground crew which also works with Lufthansa, and they were very friendly, and highly efficient.
During boarding and disembarking instrumental versions of Bollywood songs are played, which is a nice touch. During the whole flight LED lighting will be used to create a cosy atmosphere. 
Economy class seats are very comfortable, one is offered a freshly cleaned blanket, and a set of headphones. The screens are clear and definitely bigger than the ones in the Dreamliners of British Airways or KLM. 
What is great is that one can choose a great variety of different meal options. Dishes with meat, as well as various vegetarian options, catering for Hindu and Jain needs. 
My flights from Birmingham and Frankfurt left in the evening, and I got a little snack (some peanuts) first, followed just a little bit later by dinner, and a few hours later with a very light breakfast. The food was simple, but good. The portions could be slightly bigger. The Indian desserts were always very nice. 
The crew was generous in handing out drinks, and there is a choice between alcoholic drinks like beer, and wine, and juices, as well as soft drinks.
I always enjoy the good selection of recent and classic Bollywood films, but there are also some well-curated Hollywood or other international films available. One can also play music or games on the entertainment system. 
Some time after dinner, the lights will be dimmed down for a few hours to allow you to sleep, and soon afterwards breakfast will be served. 
I was always astonished how quickly the journey seemed to pass by when I was watching films, especially a longer Bollywoood film, had food, and slept a bit.

Altogether my flights with Air India were a very enjoyable experience. Booked over a month in advance my flights were very affordable, the service was always friendly and efficient, the entertainment was excellent, the food good, and my flights were all on time. I highly recommend Air India and their excellent service!"

I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours. Also, the boarding process was a mess. I stood in the line for like 45 min and then they asked me to get a new boarding pass when I was just about to get in, then put me back at the end of the line!

I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving  my bag  within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded!

After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home ! 

On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck!! I recommend everyone to avoid this airline like plague!!! I am never flying with them again!!"

The worst part were the toilets. Half way through the flight, the toilet paper was gone, and toilet floor was wet (Hopefully it was just water!). It is the same situation on both flights. When there was 400 passenger and 4 toilets, we expect Air India to anticipate these issues.

The airline staff were rude unprofessional and didn't care that most of the passengers had connecting flight or train connections,. We were given varied reasons- flooding in Mumbai, bomb threat, Trumps' July 4th parade. The Air India website said the flight was delayed to 1:30pm. United Airlines, through whom I had made the original booking, kept trying to rebook me on a different flight because they were convinced that I had missed the flight. Finally we took off at 7pm and were taken to Birmingham instead. After number of confusing instructions, both to stay on the plane and also disembark.Several passengers duty free items were confiscated as they were over the liquid limits when we went through Birmingham security. Since I had missed my connecting flight I was rebooked on the next flight the next morning and assured by Air India staff that I would be given airport hotel> But when I got to Mumbai, the ground staff denied that this could be a possibility.

There was no announcement for the huge delay and we all waited for 3 hrs before it took off. 

Was provided hotel accomodation with no visibility on which hotel and on being asked lunch and dinner only then the options were ticked in the challans.

The toilet condition was quite bad in AI 161. Some amount of empathy to long distance travellers would help.

The connecting flight from London to Copenhagen SK 502 no food was booked or even informed, leaving the passenger for a surprise to pay their own snacks after such a long travel.

On calling the AI contact number there is no response for hours leaving the passenger helpless on the flight situation.

Services need to get better in order to be world class and have a satisfied customer.

For Mumbai to Copenhagen flights it will be good to have a through checkin , rather than rechecking at Delhi.

Trying to get through to customer service takes a minimum of 42 minutes to then go through what is required to then be put on hold for a further 10 minutes plus, while they go and ask their supervisor, then to be told I have to send an email to a department which doesn't have a telephone number and the response will take 72 hours. I am now at 67 hours and no reply and no way to follow up other than an email address.
Come on AI. This is a simple amendment to an on line booking and shouldn't take this much hassle to make.

I reported seat broken & I was told that it was because I put too much pressure & therefore broke it.Never seen an airline blame their customer first, forces me on a cramped seat where I said that I will not participate in emergency procedures they didn't even tell me about, puts their employees in preferred seats while paid customers get run around.

They also let another person sit on my broken seat when I was told it was a safety risk.None of the excuses made sense.There was no system/rules, no safety procedures,no concern for customer satisfaction,no emergency evacuation instructions given or cared about

I have flown to India multiple times on United/Lufthansa,Delta,Ethiad,Emirates, Jet & almost million miles within US & I have never seen anybody not care about emergency evacuation"

"2019-07-02T00:20:44-04:00","1","review","2","Never Fly With Air India Ever Under Any Condition","Reasons Not to Fly with Air India

Some Background Information:
We had a local connecting flight from Hyderabad to Mumbai (scheduled departure for 10 PM and scheduled arrival for 11:30 AM) and then we had an international flight from Mumbai to Newark ( scheduled departure 1:30 AM and scheduled arrival around 5 PM India time)
1. Very bad communication skills with customers- For our Mumbai to Newark flight that was already delayed by 12 hours (it was scheduled for July 2nd 1:30 AM). We finally arrived in Mumbai around 10 AM. While the flight attendees were going through the security check, the Air India staff informed us that our flight to Newark would leave at 2:30. And LISTENED TO US TALK ABOUT HOW RELIEVED WE WERE THAT WE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SPEND AROUND 4 MORE HOURS WAITING FOR OUR FLIGHT. Later on, the Air India staff told us that our flight would actually be leaving at 2:30 AM not PM. Not only is our original flight being delayed by 25 hours, but Air India did not correct its customers when they were continuously feeling relieved over false information. THEY INFORMED US THAT THE FLIGHT WAS AT 2:30 AM WHICH IS AN EXTRA 12 HOURS!!! As an airline, it is their duty to be clear to the customer as to when the flight is leaving and being clear with that information especially when they are aware the the flight attendees are on a consensus different from the fact.
2. Horrible Service- In our first flight, from Hyderabad to Mumbai (left at 11:30 PM) , we flew all the way to Mumbai spent 1-2 hours in the air there and returned back to the Hyderabad airport at 3 AM because the flight had no place to land and apparently because of weather. Then, after we returned to the Hyderabad Airport, they kept us in the flight until 7:30 AM and at 7:30 AM we finally left for Mumbai and arrived at 9 AM. This means we stayed in an airplane for 6 hours when we should have only spent 1 and half hour in the plane for our flight. During this entire fiasco, the Air India staff only provided us with a biscuit packet with 2 biscuits and a lunch voucher that only worked during a horrible time.  How is one lunch voucher and some biscuits suppose to last us for 17 and a half hours?"

Big scope of improvement on food options and quality along with inflight hosts.

The flight from Sri Lanka to India was good, except the fact that some of the request made were not understood by the steward. I traveled with three of my colleges, and we were offered tea and coffee. We asked on one cup of tea and two cups of coffee. Unfortunately we got two cups of tea and one cup of coffee. We had to point it out, and then we were given one more coffee.

The flight from India to Kathmandu was expected to take off one and half hours from the point we touched down in India. Unfortunately we had to sit and wait for another one and half hours before we had the chance of boarding the flight. 

However, the disgusting fact of the flight from India to Kathmandu was not clean at all. I noted that there were used old plastic forks and spoons under the seats. In addition i dropped my flashlight guard and wanted to find it. Thus, my and my friends bent to look for it, and found remaining of food on the floor, and did not find what I dropped. I am not sad about my loss, but the National Carrier Representing India needs to be maintained with much more cleanliness than this. 

The second point that I noticed, was when food was served, there was a shortage of food on the flight, which resulted in some who do not like vegetarian food having to opt out either to eat or stay in hunger. Whether someone flies economic class or business class, I guess the basics need to be their, and this is or prime importance Air India represent your country to the whole world."

Firstly, my window seat was changed to an isle seat saying there was some issue with my seat. I was made to stand at the door for 15 minutes blocking the passengers entry with no one to attend. Absolutely no cordination between staff members. 

Upon reaching Mumbai, I collected my baggage and found the lock broken and an Unopened fitbit watch and a leather fitbit belt were missing from the same! I raised a complaint (staff was supportive enough in this case) but had to rush for my next flight soon. 

On reaching Hyderabad, my baggage was lost adding to all my frustration and bad experiences. I raised a complaint again and I was promised that it would be sent in the next flight and delivered home on the same day. It has been two days with no news of my baggage so far. I tried calling them several times but each time I had to wait for more than 45 minutes to connect to speak to an agent only to understand that they do not have any information about baggage. Also, I was advised to call Mumbai airport to check for bag status (absolutely no coordination between the staff again). After requesting to escalate the issue, I was told they have placed an emergency call back with higher officials for which I have been waiting since hours!!!!

I have a trip planned to US in a week and all my necessary and expensive ( new items) things are lying in the bag. With my bitter experience of losing a fitbit in previous leg and the progress so far, I do not have much hope on the staff. 

Has anyone faced a similar experience before? Any suggestions on this?

Thanks in advance 

Oh yes, I would never choose this airlines again!!!!"

I guess only reason for me to have chosen this flight was the convenience of a direct flight from Stockholm to Delhi. From the word go, nothing went right....haphazard boarding, all the passengers were made to sit in the flight for 1.5 hours as some technical snag came up, one snag was sorted and another came up. Finally we took off...only being treated to poor in-flight service, very bad food, poor in-flight entertainment, not so clean aircraft. Ultimately we reached Delhi 2.5 hours late, without a word of apology from the flight crew and incorrect information about the baggage belt. I was lucky enough to catch my onwards flight from Delhi (literally had to make a run for it) however some other co-passengers from Air India flight were not that lucky!!!

One thing I am sure of, I am never flying Air India again."

Below are my grievances caused due to their service, when I had booked 5 tickets(AI101 & AI102) from New Delhi to New York for my husband's and my parents and my grandmom:

1. Not updated website & lack of proper communication to customers: I booked these tickets since this was the shortest duration flight that was available on the day. After booking, two days before the flight, they sent an email stating that the flight will be rerouted via VIE (no other info was provided). I understand this change in route was unavoidable, but the communication to the customer was unclear and insufficient. I had to check separately how this would impact the flight duration & arrival time. (No info was provided on their website!!) This increased the flight duration by 5 hours, and I had to rebook their connection flight, in addition to booking hotel accommodation for the night (additional $1000 spent in the process) till the next feasible connection flight was available. 

2. Unreliable service and not providing service for what you paid: I had paid extra for each seat so that everyone could get a comfortable seat ($35-50/seat). I wanted my grandmother to feel comfortable and also considering this is a long flight, wanted to seat all of them together so that they could talk, etc. The airline seated all five of them separately (none of them got the seat I had paid for), in spite of having paid extra money!!! They did not refund the money either.

3. Unresponsive customer service: In order to ask for refunds for the seats, I stayed on their line twice for at least 35 minutes for each call and there was no response. 

I am very disappointed by their service would never use Air India for any international travel and will never recommend it to anyone!!!"

Here's what went wrong:
1. The self-check in had a glitch. It would show steps from entering the booking reference to printing the boarding pass, but as soon as I entered the reference, it would say something like ""Passenger identified"" and then exit.
2. At the departing airport, I was charged Rs. 525 per extra kg of baggage even though my ticket said 400. This could've been an error on the part of the site I booked with though (I did not book through the Air India site).
3. The staff (including the check-in staff) weren't even nearly as courteous as any other airline's in my experience.
4. The toilet on the ATR 72-600 I flew on was literally stinking and had a clogged drain in the washing sink. (That's a first for me)
5. The food on board was a veg roll and water. That sounded fine to me, but the roll itself was pretty mediocre.
6. After landing at BLR, the flight crew got into some argument with the ground staff (some verbal exchanges were audible to us passengers) regarding ground services and we had to wait in the aircraft for around 15 minutes after the doors were opened before deplaning."

I overcame of the shock that my 7-year old have to sit separately with an advice from customer executive that I have to ""request"" for seat change to sit together due to ""software"" issue. Courtesy from on-boarding executive, seat got reassigned.
Flight delayed 2 hours and never got to makeup for the lost time. 
Kept fingers crossed throughout journey;
Broken trays, non-functional touch screens, non-availability of flight map etc.,

However, AI Staff is okay as they exhibited politeness and care during the journey.
After boarding the connection flight, just before it takes off after rushing to the another terminal (after completing immigration, customs, baggage drop, security check).

When I landed at my final destination, the baggage never arrived & no staff is available to enquire. Due to many such customers with baggage ""missing"", finally managed to hold the point of contact, have been informed that baggage left in origin destination due to confusion.

Finally, managed to hold onto the team to track my baggage after 2 days.
Definitely, will avoid AI in all likelihood in any case as it doesn't make sense to have fatiguing journey and experience despite paying high price."

My poor wife was not so observant, and I was seated too far to stop her. Result: diarrhoea for her for the last two days.

Then the air craft becomes grounded & we are requested to deplane to board another aircraft. Further we are subjected to a security check a second time which also became a harassment as there was hardly any staff to speed up the unnecessary process. The small children had become very fussy by 3 am. Then we boarded the next flight running to the next opposite gate so that flight could now leave in a orderly fashion. But after 15 minutes an announcement was made that the pilots had to deplane because of some regulations. With just no further explanations about the current situation, there’s an announcement plz open gate l2. At 5 am with much confusion people started deplaning the aircraft a second time only to surround the two ground staff for some kind of explanation. It was really shameful to explain to the foreigners who didn’t understand hindi that its okay for the National Carrier Of India to behave in such fashion. But my biggest challenge of the night was dealing with my own 3 year old who was so exited, didn’t sleep until 4am in the morning & was constantly asking ‘mamma plane kab udega, cruise mein disneyland mein kab jayenge??’ Just give me an answer to my child’s constant question after reaching back home ‘mummy mughe cruise mein janna hai, kitni der mein jayenge’???

All of these looked quite battered really. Gathered later that most of the people I was flying in with flew seldom or for the first time. They were mostly the migrant workers, the blue-collars who throng the middle east in search of a better life.

It was an evening flight and was pretty full. You could see a thick cross-section of the socio-cultural strata all lined up looking for their seats in the wide bodied plane.

The crew initially appeared to me as a passive, although I could see a lady who was very courteous and extremely busy guiding some first time fliers on the left isle. I was seated on the right isle.

Accompanying a special guest, I was able to have a quick look at the first and the business class seating too, while on ground. Was spacious and opulent looking.

The economy was spacious than most I have flown in. The last very long flight I took from Abu Dhabi to Chicago was in Etihaad, which was tighter than this considering width of the seats and also the legroom. This one was really ample for economy.

The food was fair enough and the drinks ware good for a short flight.

The flight left a little late but arrived well before time at Dubai.

I had a nice experience overall.

The ticket for me from Indore to Dubai with a layover (I had work in Delhi which I finished comfortably between 11 am and 5 pm) was for 14k only, which got tripled when I took another airline back home in the absence of Air India flights.

Although I confirmed my trip before leaving the states, upon arrival in Delhi I was told I had no reservation and Air India had no flights to Hyderabad to accommodate me for days. The flight I was supposed to be on was overbooked by 20 people. Air India didn't even make any attempts to rebook me on another flight.  This also happened to my co-worker who booked via a different company.  We were able to get on the flight after having to pay someone additional money in the form of a 'tip' when they recognized that they had 4 people who were going to miss the flight.

On our return trip at Hyderabad we were given boarding passes by Air India all the way back to the states and our bags were checked to Denver at the international terminal.  We showed our passports a couple of times.  Our flight had a creeping delay that kept changing and left many hours later.  We were advised by the gate agent that someone from Air India would be there in Delhi to help us make our connection to the Swiss Air flight to Zurich.  There was no-one upon arrival in Delhi to assist us for a flight leaving in 20 minutes.  Once we got to the fork where you can either exit to baggage or go thru the International gate area, we flagged down an Air India person with a radio.  He asked for our boarding passes and advise that because the boarding pass stated 'D' we had to exist domestically and then re-enter the airport on the other side.   My co-worker was not handed back her e-ticket/boarding pass and asked for it back.  Air India had given it to someone else.   We eventually found her ticket with the other person but by the time we re-entered, we had missed the connecting flight.  Air India was unwilling to rebook us.  We found on our own, another carrier who rebooked us at 3 am for a 3am flight the next day.  This meant we were stranded in Delhi for 24 hours and would need a hotel voucher.  The employee from the other carrier that rebooked us took us to the Air India counter and asked for a Travel Voucher which the Air India manager on staff denied.  She stated Air India had no responsibility for us missing our flight due to their 3-hour delay and that airlines will not put people up for a missed connection.   When I advised her that I had 23 years worth of experience in the industry she backed down and then sent us out of the airport on one side of the building and advised us to go to the opposite side to pick up our vouchers.  When all said and done, it took 4 hours to get rebooked on our own and then fight for travel vouchers, then walk all over the terminal, waiting almost an hour for them to write the vouchers.  Next time I go back to India I will avoid this carrier and I advise everyone else to do the same."

None of the passengers received any luggage at the IAD airport. The Air India employees asked all passengers to fill out delayed baggage forms and kept taking the forms as filled. They told passengers 'your luggage would arrive in 1 or 2 days. The employees were dealing with a lot of people and helping them fill out forms. None of the passengers were given 'reference numbers'. Today is 15th June and they have not heard anything from anyone. Luggage has not arrived. No one is answering phones in Air India or replying to emails. My nephew called Delhi office and Air India needs the reference number, which we were not given. Very frustrated."

As the flight is about 10 hours we bought seats with extra leg space for the two flight. Each seat cost about 40 Euros per flight. When we got to the airport of New Delhi to fligh back the employee in the counter decided to change our seats to ""normal"" ones without even telling us and withy even mentioning that we could apply to a money return. when we mentioned the situation to the employee he didn't believe we payed for the seats and only after showing him the receipt he actually believed what we were saying and changed it back ( I don't understand how the system doesn't show how payed for what). The second part of the problem started when we arrived to gate and we had one again the same problem. They told us our chair was changed because some other person payed so we had to move. After talking to the employee and showing him we also payed he told is there was nothing he can do because both business class seats  and  with more leg space were taken.he finally told us or we accept the situation or we don't get in the plane. After the planes departure ( 20 minutes after the guy in gate gave us an ultimatum) I checked to see if there where seats available and they had 3 with extra leg space and in business. Finally in the plane we talked with one of the ladies from the plane and the only thing she gave us was a review paper (just to write how was the food bad other things) but I wasn't even able to write a complain about the situation. Finally the head of the flight attendants head of the situation and told me she was unaware of what was happening and that she would write a report down and that she would talked to someone to neat us at gate for our refund but of course this was useless ( she told me to look it up in the web page which of course is not very friendly).

I know there can be problems with in a system but was I can't believe is how the employees or AIR INDIA  managed and lied throughout the situation. If they made a mistake that created a problem for a passenger they should be more understanding and try to help out. This airline was a dissapoitment in comparison with other star Alliance members that are more client focused."

The plane was old and seemed like it should have been taken out of service years ago, the personal entertainment system was like in all air India flights I’ve ever been on - broken. The food was rather questionable and the staff walked through the cabin at the start of the flight spraying very pungent air fresheners all over the plane. If you ever see a British airways flight or Lufthansa flight for 50 pounds or so more - just trust me that those 50 pounds will be well spent for not having to travel Indian airways."

11th June I flew AI0315 from Hong kong to Mumbai via Delhi in business class. Flight got delayed marginally due to which I missed indigo flight from Mumbai to Mangalore via Hyderabad.
This again made me choose pathetic AI 679 and the experience this time was terrible.
1) Although I did web check in, it took me over an hour to get my printed boarding pass, staffs at the baggage drop were so slow which reminded me of sloths coupled with a staff taking a break without anyone attending counter and even without notifying floor manager. Replacement only came in after one of the passenger started shouting.
2) Flight was supposed to fly at 10.25 am but no staff was at boarding gate 51 until 10.45 am.
3) People had already started queuing up for boarding due to delay and at last minute the staff started announcing sequenced boarding (20 and above), 15 and above etc and asking every one to follow single queue. This is perfect example of how you create mess and complain mess on others.
4) Anyone in Air India customer experience department listening?"

Took AI 94 from BOM to MAA scheduled at 18:35. Since it is Air India the flight was delayed to 19:00 and then finally took off at 19:30. Which means I lost one hour at the Airport doing nothing. Reached hotel late and then did not get enough sleep.

The return journey was another big story.
Took AI 93 from MAA to BOM @ 21:35. Fortunately the flight was on time but when I boarded the flight there was no space for my Cabin bag which was 20 inches American Tourister.

I requested them to check once again so that if there is place they can accommodate. The staff was pathetic, no one to help. Finally they asked me to check in my bag where I had no choice but to agree.

Once I landed and fortunately on time again @ 23.35 my bag is lost, stolen or dissapeared in the sky I don't know.

I met the baggage claim department and asked them that I waited until the last bag and the conveyer belt also stopped now. It is 1 am already.

The baggage department is very cool about these incidences, they were like this is very normal you will get your bag sir. We encounter a lot of customers daily and our appraisal is based on the number of customers. They filled some form online and took details of stuff inside my bag.

I asked them can you call Chennai or check with the ground staff, they were like no sir you will get your bag delivered tomorrow. I am getting tensed and worried about my documents, clothes, keys and what not which is inside the bag.

It is 2.30 am already after a lot of fire fighting they send me home telling me that if you don't get a call from us till 9 am you can call us and we will let you know.

Reached home at 3.30 am wondrring why the hell did I choose this flight.

Next day morning at 9.30 am no one called finally I started calling the airport in Chennai and Mumbai. But they they have a app called world tracer which was showing no status update.

Got through staff at Chennai and they told me that they have sent the bag in the morning by another flight scheduled to reach by 8.30 am. I told them it is 10.30 am already no one called me.

At 11.30 am someone calls me from Mumbai airport saying that your bag has arrived. Felt like I won a Jack pot, hurray.

When I reach the airport there is no one picking the calls. Went from P4 to P6 to P10 all places where I could find one Air India personall who can help.

Wasted almost 2 hours with my 1.5 year infant kid who wanted to run and play at the Airport.

The 10th floor sales office of Air India is also not able to contact their baggage claim department on phone, intercom and mobile. In fact they are asking us to complain about this to Air India.

Finally someone picked up and Deepak helped us from Baggage claim to get my luggage back.

If you look at the instances I have gone through so much of stress overnight, no sleep and wasted the entire night and day behind this pathetic Air Line and their staff.

I highly recommend to avoid this Air Line, I would rather not travel if I am going through this Air Line."

All my trips to Germany via Frankfurt were on Air India. After that, there was an abdication of sorts, and my trips to Frankfurt over the last 8 years were always on other carriers. So it was a pleasurable surprise to find that when I was making my booking several months ago for the Trivandrum to Frankfurt trip, Air India offered the cheapest plan as Trivandrum-Delhi-Frankfurt. I chose that plan but last week I got a call from Air India that the flight from Delhi to Frankfurt was being advanced by 1 hr. that would mean just half an hour to make it from the aero bridge on arrival at Delhi to the boarding gate. Air India assured my travel agent that they will arrange to get it done and they kept their promise. AI 0466 reached Delhi at 10.45am on time. An AI staffer was waiting for me at the aero bridge with my name on a placard, took me through the International transit checkin, the by passed the regular line and took me through a special channel at immigration and then through security and took me through the long distance to Gate 21 exactly at 11.15am, just in time for the commencement of boarding.

Thank you Air India for making me feel like a Maharaja!"

LHR to Mumbai leg was okay. On arrival I cleared immigration, collected my two suitcases, cleared customs (nothing to declare) and was then directed to the Domestic Transfer area for my connecting flight to Chennai.
I handed over my two suitcases and continued to the gate.

The flight to Chennai was okay, however, only one suitcase arrived in Chennai.
The Air India staff told me that the case was still in Mumbai, but that it would arrive on following flight and that it would be delivered to me in Pondycherry the same evening.

That was Eight (8) days ago. There has been no direct contact from Air India to me explaining where my suitcase might be. No offers of assistance. NOTHING!!
If it wasn't for my Indian and local friends helping out I'd still be wearing the clothes I traveled in.

The local telephone number they provided is never answered.
I tried calling Customer Support (what a joke) in the UK -- I was in a queue for 30 minutes and gave up. Obviously the on-hold message ""Your call is important to us, please hold"" isn't true.

Areas for improvement:
Crew attitude is the first thing that haunts me (believe me, I was very much upset for few days after the trip by the way how the crew treated us).  
The aircraft being a fairly new one (Dreamliner) one would expect good overall conditiona and upkeep. however to our surprise, the aircraft was in very bad shape (the home button on the screen was not there, USB ports were all damaged, on demand games and few movie contents were not available, window shade button was damaged etc.etc.)
We have booked special meals for kids and ourselves, but that was not provided (anyhow on requesting they said they do not serve Pork and beef, so their meal would qualify as any special meal you name it)
Kids finally were served opened meal after long time.
The service crew/ attendants never showed up after initial service.
The quality of snack provided towards the end of the flight was below our expectations.
Over all, it was a nightmare.
I feel sad that our national airline is in such a pathetic condition.
I hope the crew had a little bit of passion in doing their job, but looks like they consider it like any other government service where job security is not an issue, so what matters how they behave or provide service."

The flight was supposed to be a one stop flight with a stopover at Delhi for about 2 hours. At Delhi I realised the flight was showing Vienna / Chicago which on enquiry was told there is a fueling stopover at Vienna for an hour. 

The air hostesses on the flight from Delhi to Chicago never offered any alcohol nor were Courteous enough to answer the seat call. I personally saw them switch off all the call buttons when they were indicated in their staff area. They were simply more busy chatting amongst themselves. 

At Vienna, the ground staff (locals) entered the flight and cleaned up the messy toilets. And instead do and hour we were held up in a hostage like situation for 2 hours. We weren't allowed to use toilets and the doors were opened up with 4 degrees temperature outside. 

Suddenly the crew left with their bags and new set arrived. Which again was a bit confusing. 

The journey there on got a bit better with new staff atleast asking us for alcohol and drinks. But they had the same attitude of not attending the seat calls. 

We were supposed to land at 7am in Chicago and eventually landed at noon! Which delayed all travel itenary. 

Anyways. It's high time Air India realises they they need to take up things professionally. Even if the stopover at Vienna was important due to ban on Indian flights above Pakistan airspace it could have been much better as an experience for guests.

In comparison with other airlines that I have previously travelled with, such as Thai airways. However overall, just the convenience of the direct flight and cheaper airfares makes it worthwhile. "

So we booked the tickets. I was very sceptic about flying experience of Air India. My last venture with them was in 1990. After that I never flew with them. But since there was no alternative, I looked forward to it. 

As regards Hardware of Air India, the aeroplane was Boing Dreamliner. So it was quite big & had plenty of legroom. Sitting was comfortable. The entertainment consisted of touchscreen LCD panel with wide choices of movies, TV shows etc. The choice & variety being very good,I enjoyed watching them. Thus far it was ok. But LCD panels in the middle row, suddenly stopped working after 2 hours. For the balance 6 hours, they had total blackout on screen. Technical fault, they declared. On the return flight to India, TV went on & off several times & finally when it started, few could not hear anything. Fortunately I could hear & see, but the interactive map was off & no progress of flight could be seen. 

As regards air hostess & flight attendants, lesser said the better. I had a feeling that air hostesses are glamourous, good looking, soft spoken. However Air India dashed my that impression. Looking at Air India hostesses, I am convinced just anybody who has 2 arms & 2 legs with zero warmth, courtesy, bad looks & hardly any ability to tow the food trolley can become air hostesses. The same is with flight attendants. They were rude, totally bad looking, panting while towing the food trolleys. Their style of asking for food choice was so rude that I wondered if anyone had ever trained them. When asked for a second drink they so rudely rebuffed, that I felt I committed a crime. They declared that they had no snacks to offer with drinks....no peanuts, pretzels, no chips, nothing. She said it was simply not stocked! She spilt the drinks on a few occasions. Fortunately meals were good, tasty & sumptuous. So we could get by. 

As regards general fitness of any flight attendant or air hostess, I honestly believed that in case of emergency, they would not be in any position to offer any help or comfort or confidence to passengers. They themselves looked so tired in their own chores & panted all along. 

While landing at Frankfurt airport, there was a huge thud with which it landed, that my fellow passenger screamed with terror. It was Mothers' Day & all the passengers desperately must have remembered their own dear mothers! 

Thus in spite of having good hardware, perhaps the people who manage the Air India right from ground staff, maintenance technicians. air hostess, flight attendants to pilots, they lack any sense of enthusiasm to keep good acceptable standard of service. No doubt they have run up Rs.seventy thousand crore rupees (9968 million USD bad debt).

God save India & its official flag bearer Air India. JRD Tata must have been ashamed he was ever associated with it as Chairman or founder owner before being nationalized. Regards"

The rate was cheaper than other private airlines, maybe because of early morning flight. There was ample leg room for all the rows. The seats were thinner than those of other airlines but there was no compromise in comfort. The best part was on-board breakfast was included in the fare. On top of it the flight landed fifteen minutes before time. There was no hassle throughout the journey starting from checking in to baggage claim. Excellent trip."

"2019-05-15T11:52:22-04:00","1","review","0","They give zero F@&#'s","I don't often write reviews unless a company really stands out - and this one did.  I do a fair amount of flying due to my professional and love of travel, and I have NEVER had such a horrible experience.  From the moment they came on the intercom of my first leg to let us know there were technical difficulties and they had to go back to the airport of origin, it was complete chaos (and not the normal Indian organized chaos).  

The airline staff did not communicate well at all, though they did excel at the evasive white lies to temporarily appease guests.  They would say to wait and then in an hour or two they would say to wait longer...in the meantime we all lost any opportunity to make alternative plans as all the other flights left the airport without us.  

They didn't know how to handle the crowd in the customer service line.  People kept barging into their office and, instead of insisting that they get in the queue with the rest of us, they would help these people first negatively reinforcing that people should continue to barge into their office and demand to be helped first and neglecting those waiting (semi)patiently in the queue.  

After 7 hours at the airport, they told us we would have taxi's to a hotel that they would cover.  They made us all sit at airport and wait for over an hour and then brought a bus to take us to a cockroach infested, fire trap (no, seriously, a room started on fire when the AC unit blew up, while I was there) hotel that didn't have enough rooms for us all.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  Needless to say, as I sat at the hotel at 1:30am with no room and no way to contact the airline, I was less than thrilled.  Fortunately someone else without a room had called to complain and they came to pick up up and drop up at another hotel.  So, at 2am, 10 hours after arriving at the airport, I got settled and ready to replay the next day.

They had no taxi scheduled to pick me up and didn't know anything about my case when I called in from the hotel the following day.  The flight was delayed again and they never bothered to inform me nor did they follow through with any communication regarding my questions or concerns.  

When I arrived in Delhi, I went in search of customer service as instructed and was sent on a wild goose chase as no one wanted to deal with me or had any interest in actually helping me with anything.  After walking around the airport to three different locations, getting no help and nearly having a meltdown, I gave up.

The flight itself was also below average.  The flight staff was super into customer service either.  The woman next to me was throwing up a number of times during our 20 hour flight and the attendants never stopped by once to check on her or at least to switch out her puke bags, leaving her husband and I to care for her.  Also, I've got to say that there entertainment selection was hideous...perhaps I'm spoiled, but if you're going to have the same people on your plane for nearly 24hrs, you could spring for more than few dozen old movie titles.

Today I am a happy camper again, back home in the US, but I felt it important to share my experience and let others know that I would HIGHLY recommend flying with anyone BUT Air India.  

Thanks and safe travels."

We were late taking off and the flight duration was changed without being notified leading to a significant delay. None of the screens on our part of the plane worked. So we had a 9 hour flight with no way of knowing how far away from our destination we were and with no in flight entertainment. We weren't even told about this or given an apology. The air hostess waited for me to ASK and then just said ""sorry they aren't working"" and walked off! The plane seats were SO uncomfortable I barely got any sleep. They are rock hard! Worst seats on a plane I have ever experienced. Seats are better on budget airlines! Some staff were nice but most were unsmiling and intimidating. We kept trying to call for an airhostess but the light would just be turned off and no one would come. I would never fly Air India again!"

Instead of landing in Delhi, we went to Jaipur for refuelling. As a consequence, about 40 persons lost their connections. We received hotel, yet at 2 am we were taken back to the airport. I had especially bought a ticket with secured transfer. Due to a cyclone that was coming to my destination city, Bhubaneswar, all the flights were cancelled for two days (so from the 2nd of May till the 5th of May 2019). At 2:30 in the morning, when I asked what shall I do in Delhi for two days, the officer told me Air India is not responsible in case of calamity. I asked if they can reserve a room for me, and the price was 5200 rupees. I agreed, asking them to proceed. After half an hour waiting, when I asked is reserved, the officer allegedly made me get out of the airport, one employee took my luggage and made me sign for going out! Afterwards, another officer told me to just take a cab and go somewhere! I insisted on them to reserve a room, as I am a foreigner studying in India. They told me to wait. After five hours of waiting, a friend advised me to ask before everything for a place on the first flight. At that hour, 7:30 am, it was a huge amount of people waiting. Yet, eight employees were doing nothing. When I asked why they did not do my reservation at 2 am, they refused to talk to me, and told me to go in the queue. I refused and asked them to solve the problem. Eventually, one lady gave me one leaflet, with a place reserved on the last flight, after two days (as all the other had already been taken by then!). I left the airport and stayed with some friends. The day I arrived for the flight, the 5th of May, the place was actually not reserved.

I was travelling to Dhaka for a workshop. On may 3,2019 ( Friday) reached Bangalore Airport at 9.30 and came to know that the flight to Dhaka is cancelled due to Fani Cyclone. I argued with the Air India staff in Bangalore and it was not useful. They only suggested, you can fly up to Kolkata and decide. I took a chance and on reaching Kolkata, I came to know that the entire airport has been shut for 24 hours.
I met this very nice officer from Air India-Mr.Uday Shankar Tumloor and expressed my concern. He only assured me that if the flight is flying then I will fly to Dhaka. However, the airport is shut and nothing can be done today and advised to stay in some hotel for a day. He even offered a couple of good hotel names. He asked me to call tomorrow for the update.
I received a call from Uday on the next day morning around 8 a.m. And he expressed that due to there is some technical difficulty in issuing tickets to me and asked me to come to the airport.
On reaching airport, and he was so kind to give a boarding pass for the same evening flight. I could not believe myself. It was a magic. I even now wonder; how could this happen to me. I was a lovely experience to meet Uday sir, I am posting a photo. Again in the evening, he met and enquired about me.
On my return, I again met him to thank and he offered me a good coffee with a message fo good luck.
Considering the difficulty of the situation, it was a great help from Uday Tumloor and Air India. One of the best experiences. Will remember for a long time"

The leg room in economy isn’t great and the seats are pretty sardined together. Would rate the whole experience 3/10 due to delays, quality of food, customer service and amenities offered. 

P.s I have added a menu of what’s offered at Amritsar airport, try and avoid there was mould on the food sitting in the viewing window on the kebabs, cakes and sarnies...to get a tea is super slow...also if you do want key rings (decent ones) I found this airport with only one gate had the best ones but 400 rupees each so is very expensive!"

5 days before our flight we were sent an email to say our return flight was cancelled. No changes, no we have booked you on an alternative flight. Spend 1.5 hours on hold on the phone before an operator answered and then had to rearrange the return flight to London instead of Birmingham. 

On the day of the flight when checking in, we are told that the luggage will not go straight through to Lucknow. We have to collect the luggage in New Delhi, clear immigration and customs and then drop it off to a transfer belt. Our booking had a one hour connection at Delhi. At no point in the booking process was this information given to us or else I would have booked a longer transit in New Delhi to sort all of this out. 

Spoke to the air India counter at Birmingham airport and this is where things really went down hill. I have never come across worse customer service anywhere in the world. So unbelievably rude and patronising. The staff essentially said it was our fault for booking these flights, we should have known better and there is nothing they can do. Eventually they started shouting at as - it was beyond farcical. 

The flight from Birmingham eventually left 2 hours late. So we missed our planned connection anyway. We had to them plead our way on to the next air India flight to Lucknow from Delhi which was 6 hours later. 

Oh and the entire bag collection and drop off process with customs and immigration took a solid 2 hours at the airport. 

I think it’s safe to say we’ll never fly Air India again but honestly, I get the feeling no one at Air India will care. There is no love or dedication to the company from its own employees. What a shame. "

I also tried emailing but no response to that either, not that I expected one. So now I have to wait until I get to the airport to hopefully get it resolved as I'm flying out?

NO flight entertainment of course, except for the staff chatting behind closed curtain when not asleep !
Although delivered quickly on arrival, our luggages had lost their priority labels, so we had to wait more or less until the very end to get them !

Finally got to know that the Gate no. has been provided from a staff but the same was not announced or updated in the digital boards. When the boarding started, there were two weird vehicles attached to the stairs of the plane, which were basically for another round of security check. It was so hard to get up in those vehicles as the stairs were steep and my mom and dad who are old, struggled badly. Male security persons were opening ladies purses and searching them so disrespectfully. When I asked what's this checking for, I was not given any answers. The body check was also done in the most disrespectful way and everyone was feeling frustrated. When we finally came onboard, none of the staff or the captain apologised for the almost 2 hrs delay. Everyone seemed as if the flight is on time. Finally landed in Kolkata and many passengers missed their connecting flights because of such irresponsible behaviour of Air India. Never again!

I don’t even know where to begin! I had been traveling on business in Bangalore for 1 week and had another leg of my business travel in Hyderabad. 

We arrived to the airport 3 hours early because we knew the check in lines would be pretty long from past experience. We waited in line like civilized human beings and as we got to the front of the line a few hours later the experience took a horrific turn...

The check in staff was so incredibly rude to my team. They proceeded to scold us because “ there are people behind you in line who depart before you; therefore, we had to wait until they came through. I’m sorry but what kind of customer derive is that? Why is it our fault that we followed the basic rules of arriving to the airport early to check in? Why should we potentially risk missing our flight because people arrived after us? The situation got worse as the check in agent proceeded to put his hand in my face and literally said “ shut up” when I was not even being rude. I was purely trying to make a statement that we would not back away after waiting for 3 hours. 

Then the chaos continued... We boarded the plane and realized there were people in our seats we had specifically selected. I get claustrophobic and hate sitting in the middle which is why I always pre check and pay for the seats I prefer. Well rather than helping us out with an aggressive customer who had sat down in our seats just because they were free the flight attendant told us to find other seats and did not attempt to resolve the situation. He essentially made us feel like it was our fault for not getting to OUR seats first. What kind of service is this where you enable people who have no manners and can’t follow rules to abuse foreign travelers?? We ended up getting placed in the only remaining seats in business class and THE SAME MAN demanded that we now pay for business class seats! Why would you not resolve the issue ahead OR just assume you shouldn’t force customers to pay for seats that we didn’t intend to have in the first place? 

Air India is horrific and I suggest everyone pay the extra $15 to fly ANY OTHER airline. They don’t give one damn about their paying customers and give their company a horrible name. I certainly will never fly them, even if they are Star Alliance members! "

It is always a pleasure to fly the Air bus 787 dream liner operated by Air India on this route with its full stretchable seats that converts itself into a flat bed.  The check-in was handled very efficiently by Mr Sato.  
Overall it was a very smooth flight without much of turbulence.  The landing at Delhi particularly was very smooth, demonstrating the attention and the skill of Capt. Rajat Rana.
The food served on board was really delicious with good choices and the service by Ms Suruchira Malhotra and Ms Saraswathi L was really great.  Both of them were so courteous and efficient and were eager to attend to each and every need of the passengers.  There is certainly scope for improvement is the in-flight entertainment options, though.

Even upon calling their Customer Service Number in Bombay, the time of departure was not clear. The flight departed 7 hours after it's scheduled time printed on the ticket. The ""Rescheduling"" was an excuse to cover up delays due to crew shortage.
In flight, the cabin staff were curt, if not downright rude, telling the passengers not to use lavatories every so often, either due to turbulence or meal service. The food served was decent, so one star for that. The service was sadly pathetic, the staff banging down food trays and beverage glasses and coming back to ""clear"" the cabin in brief order )this was a 15 hour flight!). Apparently, the cabin crew were tired and in a hurry to get some rest. The Stewardess in the tail end of the plane put on a red warning light and told the passengers that the toilet was out of order, the staff made merry use of the same toilet while passengers could not. It was clear that the staff were looking after themselves and passengers were not a priority.

The second star is for the cockpit crew, the flight was smooth and timely once it was in the air.

My return on AI103 on 05 April was even worse, the ""non-stop"" flight landed in Bombay after departing about 1 hour late.The passengers were forced to sit in their seats for the 2 hours the aircraft was on ground at Bombay. The flight then arrived in Washington Dulles around 6 hours after the time printed on the ticket.

Close to 360 passengers were made to sit for 2 hrs in a flight and final asked to disembark after diff employees, the air hostesses, the crew at the entry and a ground staff member gave us diff responses about leaving time. for a 5 pm flight, boarding began at 4 and we were asked to leave the aircraft around 7 pm in a transit lounge where it took the airline a couple of hours to clear us out since we were part of an international flight. Single women, families, biz executives were put through a lot of misery as you can imagine but the airline could not care less. we had ONLY ONE PERSON to PROVIDE TRANSIT CARDS to 360 passengers. the overall process of checking the system and handing over cards made everyone sweat it out. 

AIr India could have handled it better. But were the AI Staff cooperative. Absolutely not, the Ai guy kept yelling as if it was the fault of the customers that the flight was delayed. 

We were onboarded at 10 pm, and the flight took off at around 12:30. Throught the 11 hr ordeal that we were at the airport, NO ONE and I mean NO ONE gave the passengers ANY Information. Someone senior with a middl ename Rony said we coudl get a refund only for the AI staff member to say NO refund. It was pure mayhem. 

Lastly, the systems of my copassenger and I were both not working. WHile the air hostess knew it - power failure, she just kept mum and looked at me in disbelief almost as If I had destroyed it. 

Service - ok

Food - The only excellent experience was food. Love Air India for that and amazing leg space in economy."

Also I wanted to fly Air India's Dreamliner as on previous occasions I had found it a most comfortable aircraft. I was travelling with my partner and we were not disappointed it was a comfortable flight.

The service was efficient and the crew friendly. The flight, surprisingly arrived before time and we would both recommend it to other passengers."

On our outbound journey in row 35 the window tv screen didn't work at all and the passenger requested to be moved; the middle screen for us worked in a limited way and only after intense frustration; the aisle screen worked so we satisfied ourselves with AI's sub-par selection of entertainment. On the return journey all three screens in our row 31 announced a media center malfunction from the start. So not only did we have to bear with a 16-hour flight without entertainment, but since the screens could not be shut off, the AI stewardess creatively screened the monitors with old newspapers - she must have done this before as she knew the solution immediately. On another note, the seat reading light controls did not work and the call-buttons did not work, so we used camping headlights to read. Strangely in the middle of the night, every single seat reading light in the economy class cabin turned on for about 30 minutes - think several hundred bright torches / flashlights in a dark room - only to go dark again."

Once you bid the credit card is charged. They claim that they will confirm the seat only at the check-in counter (that is what I understood). 

But to my surprise at the check-in counter, they said that they would confirm it only at the boarding gate. 

So the airline expected me to wait until the boarding to know if I had been upgraded.

When I reached the boarding gate they said that the flight is still open and they have no information. and also I had to wait for the flight staff to arrive to allocate the seat if any. 

The boarding had started and they still did not have information on the upgrade. I had to wait and wait. until almost all had boarded. After that only they confirmed my upgrade. 

Is it worth the wait after paying for it? not for me any more. 

I later learnt that passengers that had not bid and were willing to pay and upgrade at the Check-in counter got upgraded instantly. 

I think Air-India needs to rethink this process. it is a hassle and a lot of inconveniences."

We contacted Air India regarding compensation for delay however, the request was denied. Currently, we are seeking legal help.
It is one of the most expensive airlines with such a poor service, the major problems are,
1. Always late
2. poor food quality
3. Always blocked/ unclean toilet
4. Poor customer service

Now, the airhostess asked about food..We said non-veg for a fun and we got a non-veg plate.They served gajar halwa, pav bun with bhaji and chicken tandoor pieces. There was a sandwich also.

Broken furniture, information screens that were not working, seats with holes in.
Is this really how Air India want to impress, and win over its customers with these disgusting International business lounges.

At this stage , according to their website I should have expected an apology and a compensation. Instead the blame is shifted onto me ??? What is so odd it took them 72 hours to realise that my luggage which was scanned at the Heathrow has been posing an undisclosed threat to security - and now I have to go back to the airport and collect it at my own expense??

There was no ground ataff at the boarding gate even though the boarding time had passed by. The plane was obviously delayed because of delayed arrival of the incoming plane (as if it wasn't Air India). There was no delay shown in the estimated time of departure yet the plane was late almost by 30 minutes. This is the usual story whenever I've traveled by AI655.

Talking about the 'free' meal onboard, all they gave was 2 half loaves of bread with cucumber, tomato, and cheese stuffed in between along with a small pack of juice. I swear this portion cannot even be considered as a snack for a 5 year old kid.

It was our first time flying with Aid India and I have to say that it will have been our last time too. It was my husband, our two daughters (2 and 7 yrs old) and myself (7+ months pregnant). Trying to update our information pre-flight was an absolute challenge (Air India's website kept timing out while I was entering info  online), we were not able to select any seats online even within 24 hours before the flight, the assigned seats were all scattered throughout the airplane so that my two daughter (2 and 7 years old) were supposed separate without a parent or even a sibling, and you could not print any boarding passes. We went to the airport early to get seats together. The lady checking us in tried her best and at least had the four of us sit closer two each other (two together, one a row in front, and the fourth in the same row but on the other side of the isle). Surprisingly people traveling together sitting around us had exactly the same issues going on AND my husband, who sat in front of us, had an empty seat besides him (So why not put our daughter, who was scheduled to sit on her own on the other side of the isle sit next to him?). In a combined effort of multiple rows we all managed to switch around and did what the airline was not able to do and have people that travel together actual sit together. The food was pretty awful. When we got on board we got advised that we would receive our stroller, which they took at the gate, back at the gate when arriving in Goa. This was NOT the case. Old plane with absolutely no inflight entertainment. The actual touchdown of the plane is Goa was so rough that we expected to at least bust tire... shocking. Besides that it would have been helpful to get ""immigration cards"" on the place so we could have them filled out before landing in Goa and not had to do that in the terminal when landing at 3:30am. On the way back .... WOW ... is all I can say. My husband had flown home a few days before the rest of the family. He says that his food was uneatable on board and that the baggage claim in Dubai took forever. The girls and I returned from Goa to Dubai yesterday and had an AWFUL flight. Again, we could not pick seats prior to check in to the flight and the airline had us not sit together ( At least this time the two year old was sitting with me and not on her own). We got put in the last row with me sitting with my two year old and my 7 year old 3 seats over on the other side of the isle. Staff told us that there is nothing they can do about that. Luckily a lovely lady helped us out so we could sit together (Thank you). The ordered meals were not there but we did not get told that. Instead the crew just plopped a vegetarian meal on a tray with a juice and gave it to the girls. The hot meal was so spicy that even I could not eat it. They ran out of orange juice, apple juice, and peanuts. The smell of the bathrooms were agonizing. The line of people crowding us in our seats was plainly annoying. In total all our meals were bad to uneatable. Our seats could not recline. A guy was TALKING on his phone when coming into land. When pointing it out and complaining to the stewardess she just said that there is nothing they can do and to feel free to complain to the airline. The airplane itself was old and dirty. No inflight entertainment at all. Baggage collection was shocking. Our stroller, which they had taken at the gate in Goa, did not get brought out till FAR after the last suitcase had been delivered on the belt. I am 7+ months pregnant, traveling with two young kids, and NOBODY EVERY offered to help but we got put in the worst seats of the plane with awful food and no drinks left since they ran out (Oh, lots of booze on board though)."

I came from Dubai through emirates airlines to Delhi, then to catch a domestic air India flight, the ground staff didn't take my flight ticket, and they had said that the flight is overbooked, and when I told them my flight ticket is a confirmed ticket, they said yes but will not let you in.

Any respected airlines wouldn't do that, but if it happens it would at least upgrades its passenger seat to a business one, and this didn't happen.

Air India offered me a hotel room in centaur hotel for a night till tomorrow, the hotel is the worst hotel ever, not even a star, not even a hotel, the room smells, bed smells, bathroom smells, the food is disgusting, many cockroaches.

The scheduled departure  was at 9.50 and I reached airport at 8.30. Following is my overall experience about the flight ( Rating given out of 5, 5 being the highest):-
A. Check-in: Checking at the self check in kiosk was smooth. Travelling with Hand Baggage .(Rating 4).
B. Lounge access: I was flying economy and hence there was no lounge faculty offered. I used my Mastercard to access airport lounge.(Rating Neutral)
C. Boarding and departure: Flight was delayed by 55 min. Scheduled departure was at 9.50 but delayed departure at 10.45. 55 minutes delay in a 1 hour flight is so appalling. Boarding opened at 10.00 at Gate 23C by bus. Boarding process was smooth and fast. Push back was at 10.40 and we took off at 10.45 (Rating 3). 
D. Seats and interior: The aircraft was an Airbus A319 series and looked well maintained. The interior in beige looked bright and well lit. Seats upholstered in orange and yellow ochre gives vibrancy in the feel. My selected seat was 17D, an aisle seat from the rear. Seat pitch was comfortable legspace was ok for a 1 hour flight. Seat recline was about 110 degree.(Rating 4.5).
E. In flight Service: Light snacks of Frooti and sandwich was provided in the flight. Great gesture in a 55 minute flight. In-flight magazine Shubh Yatra provides quality light reading . (Rating 4).
F. Arrival and baggage: Flight landed at 11.50. Gates were opened at 11.55 (Rating 4)
G.Overall flight experience and suggested area of improvement : Barring delay, overall flying experience was good. Staff was well groomed and polite. Delay downgraded my overall rating(OVERALL RATING 3.75)"

There is no way to describe check in. One very long queue for people who need to check in from scratch. Then if you have been to the self check in and just need to do Bag Drop off it is a total mess with no one over seeing it. People are there who have to check on from scratch instead of where they should be. People push in right to the counter staff and they still attend to them and don’t send them to the back of the queue. Six men arrived with many suitcases and parcels each and an Air India employee tried to get them checked in to Baggage drop from scratch despite the massive queue. It was a total mess and took nearly an hour to do a Baggage Drop. Air India have jet themselves down massively here."

After more than 2 hours on the phone with Air India to confirm the cancellation, we also had to email the e-commerce department to arrange a refund (you can't call them).

When we arrived in Delhi for our connecting flight we were told that the first segment had not been cancelled.  We showed them the confirmation email from Air India.  It took so long for them to sort it out that we MISSED our Bodhgaya flight.

It took another 2 hours to get that ticket reissued for the next day.  They took no responsibility for the missed flight and provided no compensation for the loss of our hotel room in Bodhgaya, the extra hotel night in Delhi or meals.

Since coming back home to Canada, I've emailed them 3 times with no response.
The refund they originally promised for the cancelled segment has not been provided.

I now understand why there were so many angry customers at the Air India counter that day in the Delhi airport.
They have the worst customer service I've ever seen - they don't even pretend to assist you.  
AND THEY'VE STOLEN THE MONEY OWED TO US.

We flew several other domestic airlines (with no issues) who provided great customer service.

Save yourselve the headaches - and money.  Book with any other airline than Air India."

Choose for convenience not for comfort.","We booked Flight from Mumbai to Singapore both ways mainly because it was without any stops (direct) which saves time and we could use the entire day for sight seeing. The purpose was served and that way it worked out well. We chose Air India because only 3 airlines give the direct flight from Mumbai -Singapore, Out of which Singap[ore Airlines was too costly for the night flight, Jet Airways are unreliable due to the crisis going on in the company, so this was the only choice. AI changed the Air craft to smaller one a month before departure and so we ended up in a small A320 airbus, which was a crowded aircraft. The food was OK for  Mumbai- Singapore but was good while returning back.But overall the flight was good and safe. And finaly thats what we want- A safe Journey!"

I was supposed to come back on April 20th but yesterday I got an email that they changed the schedule for the return flight. They made a stopover time in New Delhi for 10 minutes. 10 MINUTES!!!  Is that even legally possible? I think the lowest possible stopover time is 30 minutes. Anyway, I called the airline, they gave me another flight on the evening before (19th of April). Now I am supposed to wait for 12 hours at the airport during the night. I tried to call the airline and the airport for 3 times, nobody gave me a decent information about the hotel and the reason for changing the schedule of stopover time for 10 minutes. The last guy I talked to from Airindia gave me another phone number (which I already called) and simply hang up the phone. Extremely rude customer service. I do not know if they give me a hotel so my holiday to Thailand will be super stressful."

I travelled on the domestic sector of  both the flights, which were flying international . The  plane used for both the sector was Boing 787 Dreamliner
The flights took off on time and arrived on time. Cabin decor was nice and clean.Seat pitch and leg space is very comfortable as compared to the other domestic airlines.Enroute breakfast/ snacks were served, which were good in taste, quality and quantity.Crew members were polite and courteous .

They lost both my and my travel companions bags (we came from different destinations). It has been 11 days and I still have no update. After reading reviews, it seems this is very common. The response is always “we are looking into it” but how can that take 11 days...

Impossible to understand how my baggage is not here when the flight from New Delhi to ktm is less than 2 hours.

Staff at the Delhi Airport Air India office were mostly rude, aggressive and unhelpful, although a couple of the younger staff were more helpfulThey booked us into Centaur Hotel whilst we waited for our replacement flight. This hotel is dirty, would breach all UK health and safety regs and had nowhere to buy a coffee or soft drink, never mind alcohol. 

Our return journey from Cochin to Birmingham should have taken 15 hours but has actually taken 36. 

In terms of food, in flight entertainment the quality was very poor. On one flight I couldn’t get my seat to be upright, only recline. Contrast this with Lufthansa who provided our replacement flight - the quality of their service, food and in flight entertainment was excellent. 

However cheap your Air India flights might be, my advice would be - don’t be tempted - it could ruin your holiday. "

There was no control over passengers who were out of their seats, ,blocking the aisle and draped over others' seatbacks.
Meal service was chaotic, many passengers being missed. Coffee was impossible to get hold of. Food tasted ok but I now have food poisoning. Having avoided meat in India over several weeks, I stupidly decided it should be ok on the plane but I'm guessing the chicken curry was the culprit.
On clearing up, one unsmiling, even grumpy crew member had not locked her rubbish cart so a load of rubbish was deposited in the aisle. If was cleared up but no apologies.
The person sitting in the middle seat felt unwell and should have been moved ,- Air India seem to always keep the back row free for staff. This didn't happen. The person behind me had an asthma attack. There were 2 announcements asking passengers to remain seated which a passenger doctor attended to her. No effect and all the staff crowded around too. Very unprofessional.
The entertainment choice was very limited and many screens did not work. 
Good legroom on a dreamliner if you can cope with the surrounding chaos and poor service.

In total it took me one hour to resolve the issue as they moved me from one counter to another.
 The most arrogant and rude ground staff one can encounter is Remelia Dsouza, she ensured that she made one hell of an experience for me in this flight by again checking my baggage only for me while other passengers just showed their boarding pass at the boarding counter as well.

Not for take off and landing or when the seatbelt sign came on mid flight. There were young children, whose parents did not enforce the seat belts on them, standing on the seats at take off, and wandering about at landing!! An accident waiting to happen. If it had just been on this flight I would have blamed the crew, but it happened on both long haul and internal flights so is obviously bad training on Air Indias part.

I spent over 4 hours waiting on Hold trying to contact AI Call Centres - on Delhi, Mumbai & Chennai Numbers trying to find out if there would be a charge to change the Date of the Return Flight and if so, how much. The T's & C's say there are no penalties/fees after the onward journey has been done (except for the Fare Difference, if any).
Finally after a 20 min wait on one day, I got hold of someone and after checking the availability for the new date, she mentioned that it would be the Fare Deptt who would be able to tell me the Price ! She then transferred me and the line got disconnected after 40 mins. She confirmed that someone would call me back on my number (which I updated). A week and past the travel date, no call back from anyone !
I even sent emails, only to be given the same contact numbers that I have trying unsuccessfully.

B'lore airport was a mess. Had 2 hours layoff for the outbound Flight.
1) Only 1 Counter for Foreign Passports and the guy was super slow, taking 20 mins for each person.
2) Luggage for hardly 50 passengers takes more than 30 mins.
3) No one in Air India knows where to deposit the luggage for the connecting Air India Flight. Someone asked me to just put it on the conveyor Belt, which I did, only to run and retrieve it later.
4) 500+ people in Q for Security early morning at 5:00.
5) Display was showing Gate No 6 for Kolkata (Air India). On reaching Gate 6, they said it was Spice Jet only and asked me to wait. It was 5:45 and scheduled departure was 5:50 and display showing Boarding from Gate 6. On asking a 2nd lady, she says, it's Gate 4. No one in Gate 4. Then someone says Gate 2, which is not even on the same Floor. Escalator only coming down, not going up. Mad rush for a lift and finally it was Gate 2 and just escaped missing the Flight by seconds. From their attitude, they wouldn't have bothered leaving a few passengers with Boarding passes behind (doubt very much if all connecting passengers made through on time). No announcements, not even interested when I mentioned that the display was showing wrong Gate info."

He was very rude and had all of his family (about 20) crowd the desk area, not forming a que, saying all of these people are accompanying a wheelchair bound elder relative and board first with her, crowding out my elderly husband (85) standing there with a cane. He was nearly knocked over by this unruly mob. That whole group of able bodied persons were allowed to board before my husband. AND, when finally helping my husband stow his baggage above, a very rude, able bodied man hollered at me to get out of his way. He did not offer to help stow the luggage but was obviously discontent with my helping my husband and being in his way on this narrow isleway. I should have taken a picture of this man and reported him but he was shoving inappropriately. We do have to return via this airline and will demand that the employees who work for it take proper measures to control unruly persons. We were unhappy with the way this crowd was able to intimidate the employees and get their own way, not adhering to what they were told to do. Employees: man up or woman up and TAKE CONTROL!

I have yet to have mediocre experience with them, and for the most part they just provide an actively bad experience. This time when flying to Port Blair from New Delhi the ticket agent aggressively asked for our tickets as if we were in trouble. When we asked him why he was being so hostile, he simply started joking around with his colleague and ignored us. When we asked him for his manager, he said he did not have one. It was as if we were on an airline prank show. 
The rest of the flight was the same terrible nightmare it always is. Rude service, cramped seats, dirty bathrooms, and no real system for getting people on or off airplanes. It is as if the people at Air India got most of their information from running an airline by watching the movie Airplane without the sound on and not understanding that it was all meant to be facetious. Sadly, because of over-subsidies this terrible airline will continue to be present on some of the most convenient routes in India because they do not pay a price for their incompetence. If you can avoid it don't fly them, if you can't avoid it, just don't go."

Really? Really?! Our stomachs were doing quite enough sinking of their own accord after suffering 48 hours of the Myanmar Malady.  

We checked at the front desk and while Air India is famous for its delays, we still hadn’t thought it would happen to us. Yep. 11 pm departure now heading out at 2.40 am. Thanks Google. Thanks a bunch.  It was around 7pm at that point and we settled in for the long haul.  Luckily were were ensconced in  Singapore Air’s Silver Kris Lounge in Terminal 2.  The airmchairs pulled together well and the staff magicked up some pillows and blankets and we caught some much needed sleep as the night wore on and the lounge emptied out. There were about 3 of us left at 1.30 am when we trekked to the gate.

With recent heightened tensions in the region we weren’t surprised to have to go through yet another layer of security. This was our first flight on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and these are big planes. Huge. Which mean huge queues. Massive even.  (Priority boarding as its advantages). It being almost 3 am by the time we trundled to the runway and, still being under the weather, we only had a couple of bites of the savoury hot snacks, used our hot towels, declined the champagne, turned the seats into beds and slept for almost 5 hours. We think we were both out like lights within about 10 minutes.  The crew were somewhat alarmed that we weren’t eating and absolutely desperate to at least make teas and coffees when we were on approach to New Delhi. shame we couldnt enjoy the food, but the beds made up for everything. They were flat very wide and comfy.

Other than the delay they were a pleasure to fly with."

Also, and it wasn't something I was used to, children were allowed to run up and down the aisles giggling and playing. I found it slightly irritating but an Indian guy implied that Indian airlines were more relaxed about this sort of thing than American or European airlines. He also told me, although I can't confirm this, that the Asian airlines in general had more space in Economy.

Out of the 10 seats on my row, 5 had some kind of an issue w the entertainment system. Being older people on these seats they did not complain and just sat without entertainment. Tried helping a couple but the armrest that holds the plug for earphones was loose and hence the plug was sliding inside the armrest. Just weird. Had not seen this capitated airline seats and entertainment services in my frequent travels EVER. Service was good, FA's were helpful food was fine. But seats were stained, no cushions left (on at least 8 out of the 10 on the way in and 7 out of 8 on the way out that I personally sat to check), the angle of the seats threw my young 40yr old spinal cord and neck out of whack. MAde an unscheduled stop for refueling in Sharjah. Bathrooms are of course bad.

Please DO NOT ever fly this airline, more Importantly, DONT LET YOUR PARENTS fly this airline. It's not worth the 400 bucks you will save.

There was enough and tasty food, as well as an adequate choice of latest movies, and flying crew were efficient (on a previous experience with Jet, I had practically fainted from lack of food and low blood sugar). The choice of liquor isn't great, and the crew typically assume that if you are an Indian woman, you won't drink hard stuff and show you juices. But if you ask for it, they will give it to you. The flights are packed though--they use Dreamliners--and the worst result of that is about 30-40 minutes' wait for bags after deboarding. But this also means they allow you to fly with 40 kgs, so you don't mind. What I surmised is that baggage loading on belts is haphazard and done in a Soviet style, so there will most likely be a 20-minute gap between your two bags!

Shortly before the flight they sent an email it has been postponed a couple of hours due to inaccesibility of Pakistan airspace. My arrival time would be the same according to the new itinary they sent.

However i guess they forgot that the delay in rerouting works both to and from, because when we arrived in delhi many of us had missed our connection to Goa. And so they had a new boarding pass for me for a flight 12 hours later! 

Naturally for such an extended waiting time an airline would make it comfortable to you as an excuse? No, got the sorriest curry in the airport and the smallest bottle of water a company had ever packaged. No lounge, no apoligy or even a comment. Playing it like its not their mistake..

How about the new flight then? Well i was cramped into the very back of the airplane on the seat that wont lean back while the guy in front of me was an avid leaner taking all the little space i had in these seats that already wont fit a grown man. 

So in the end i arrived in the middle of the night, too late to check in at the homestay i had booked i was doomed to wait 5 more hours for the morning to come. 

If thats not enough!! I also forgot my bose headphone on board and while they managed to recover it, they wont sent it but recommends me to have someone pick it up for me! 
Do i know anyone in Delhi? Nope! Isnt this an airline who can handle international customers? Apparently not.

So now i have to pay their warehouse charges for months until i happen to be able to pass by Delhi again. Or perhaps just forget about the headphones if the charges are more expensive.

We’re going to India next year and unfortunately we’ll be flying on AI a lot. This is because the flights are direct with no connections. However AI has one of the worst on time performance records there is. If there’s any way to book my tickets on different carrier if at all possible. Surprisingly AI hasn’t had a fatality since 2009 I think the plane was on it’s way to San Francisco when it went down in the ocean and they never figured out what had actually happened. India actually has one of the worst airline safety rankings for domestic aircraft, making it safer to fly in Pakistan and Bangladesh, hell even Air Koryo from North Korea is safer than Indian planes.

This is  after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India. 

On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office. 
This was my first and last experience with Air India
My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together.
There were alot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct. 

Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response FROM Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago .

Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection.
After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building.
The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet . 
There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another.

Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. ""
The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job. 

I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB. 
The customs kept repeating that the air india was not responding .
However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a ascene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding ,the server was working and the money was collected in cash .
We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night. 

This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through.

Finally , Air India has a vigilance dept, which provides a phone no. to report such misconduct and malpractices. As expected the number does not work. 

I will of course be taking this further up and present the video evidence I have that shows all the people involved. I do hope no one else goes through, what I went through

I would not recommend anyone to use this airlines after my experience. The airline is 2.5 on a scale of 10, there are some serious concerns with the management . 
I believe this is the reason they fail to secure a buyer for privatisation of this company. Every year the govt provides 1,500crore in aid from TAXPAYERS MONEY towards this management that refuses to work and lacks ethics.
I would NOT be using the services of this airline ever again even for if offered for free.

The worst experience started @ Indore Airport. On the counter, when I asked about Mr. Ashwin, ex-manager of Air India and my friend, I was shocked to know that he passed away in heart attack at age of 42, RIP. Due to shock, I forgot my set of documents including all my bookings, travel insurance, my medical prescription etc. at counter. After passing through security and reaching boarding gate, I recollected and asked ground staff that get me papers back but she straight away refused saying that flight will get delayed where as at that moment the incoming flight AI 636 from DEL has not arrived and IDR airport is small enough to get docs from counter in maximum 2 minutes.

After long haul of 6 hours, BOM-BKK  by Dreamliner, AI 330. nothing much happening.

Return was like horrific. I got seat 28 A, which does not have recliner. I asked for change of seat, air hostess asks me to search a vacant seat on my own. Can you imagine that? 

Then started loud music on personal music system. I and my nearby Mother-Son fellow travelers called all 2 female air hostess and one male air host to stop that but they behaved like being deaf. At a point of time we really thought that air hostess is handicapped and deaf. 

It was like party all night for more than 3.5 hours on AI 331(March 2, 2019). I could hardly even close my eyes. 

Dreadful food both the ways. Pav Bhaji at 2:30 am? Only AI can do it. 

I felt ashamed of being Indian due to behavior of fellow indian passengers and behaviour of AI staff. 

Over with my frequent flyer membership. I will drown my 20k + points accrued in sewage rather than flying AI again."

The first time to 45 minutes later. But that was a month ago.

Now on the day of travel they have delayed the flight by five hours leaving at midnight.
And I have a pre-booked train ticket to the airport. So 5 hours to kill at Arlanda airport. :-/
Plus, the worst is that I have connecting train travel booked in Delhi and other arrangements which I will now miss. 

The flight was due to leave at 19:45.
Now it will leave at 23:55.
And I doubt the vague reason given: ""operational reasons"" is honest.
I suspect it is a cost saving reason.

I have a friend who regularly travels to India and within India who — when I informed him who I was flying with — said ""Good luck with that. I vowed never to fly AI again"". He said he had many bad experiences, cancelled flights, no seat booked when arriving at the airport, etc., although this was mostly Indian internal flights.

Looks like they are a dishonest carrier that can't be trusted to keep their paid for commitments.

I have been flying with numerous airlines since I was 12 years old (in those days from the UK to Singapore) and this is the first time EVER that an airline has changed its departure time. Here AI has changed it twice!!!"

Inflight service, and cabin crew attitude has improved tremendously, but the overall service is still needs improvement.

Our onward flight was on time, and they even served a hot breakfast. The cabin crew was very pleasant, but the cabin felt aged and dated, and the seatback screens were all covered up with seat covers. 

My return journey never happened from the original airport as the flight was cancelled by Air India. When I called them to get a replacement flight, they couldn’t provide one, and they were not all willing to rebook another flight by another carrier, or from another airport about 5 hours away.  All they could promise was to get me a refund for the cancelled segment. But, that hasn’t happen yet even after three weeks.

AI reneged its responsibility by not providing me an alternate flight.   Finally, I had to find, book, and pay for another flight from a distant airport, and spent time and money to get there.

A few years ago also it happened: AI abruptly cancelled our onward connecting flight without providing an alternate choice.  AI’s customer service has to improve a lot."

That's not yet a problem, but when on Frankfurt Airport, nobody from AI could confirm if the plane would go or maybe not and the departure delay was finally between 60 and 90 min. Estimated arrival time in Delhi 2 HOURS late because AI changed the route ... All without sufficient and early enough information for the passenger. And then they took time to release the luggage. That is unbelievable!!!
Due to this delay I missed my next flight to my final destination Srinagar. 
BUT: the best - or worst - is yet to come!
At the Air India ""assistance counter"" in Delhi there was a huge queue and the guys seemed to be totally overcharged.
My request to provide me a flight or to help me in any other manner was simply refused with the comment ""I should write an email to Air India"" . There would not be any seat available until mid of March.
Seems Indian government needs this civil airline for troup transports and forgets the service towards the playing client.
This so called ""service"" of that government airline is poor and more than disappointing. I am an alone travelling woman, had to manage a Plan B all alone, no support at all from Air India. Furthermore this all costs me a lot of additional money (new domestic flight, hotel, taxi etc.)
My final judgement: MISMANAGEMENT!!! 
I will put this complaint on social media including the ministers in charge like Aviation Minister and Home Minister. 

P.S.: There is one positive point: the crew on bord was very friendly and tried everything to ease the situation of those who were in trouble because of Air India's unnecessary delay."

But nowadays even budget airlines will shoot you a text or an email if your flight is going to be significantly delayed.  Air India?  Not!  We left our hotel in Delhi at 1 am for a 4 am departure to SFO.  I even checked the flight status before leaving the hotel.  Once inside the terminal, the International DepartureCheck-in/Bag Drop line was 1 hour long.  They only had 7 stations open for God-only-knows how many departures.  Once we reached the counter, dropped our bags, and got our boarding passes, i happened to notice that our flight was delayed until 6:20 am.  I asked the agent what gives, and got a shrug in reply.  Le sigh...
After another hour in the Security line, and running the Duty-free gauntlet, we got out to the gate, which was behind locked glass doors.  There were ample comfortable looking chairs and even a few chaises in the gate area.  Out in the concourse, there were only 60 or so miserable chairs, with 200 pissed off people milling about with a couple of hours to kill.  We walked further down the concourse and found a couple empty seats and waited.  At 5 am, they finally opened the gate area, and had our carry-on x-rayed yet again.  We boarded at 5:45 and pushed back at 6:20.
Our aircraft, VT-ALH is a 10 year old Boeing 777-200LR, which first flew in 2009. I seriously doubt that this aircraft has had any money spent on the passenger cabin since put into service.  It is just beat-up inside.  Scuff marks and dings everywhere.  The seat cushions are thin and grubby, many arm rests droop down to the seat.  The In-Flight Entertainment system is the oldest one I've ever seen on a long haul flight, and is for all intents and purposes non functional.  If you can even get the system to work, half of the functions are inop.  On the flight from SFO, I had to try numerous headsets before I found one that worked.  On the return from Delhi, I had no audio, period.  The guy sitting next to me had nothing - Black screen.  Not even the moving map was working.  Pathetic...
The food?  Are you kidding me?  After a month of eating our way through India, enjoying the most delicious food in the world, the food on Air India is barely edible.  Whatever you want, as long as it's tasteless Daal, rice, and either Paneer Curry or Chicken Curry of some dubious pedigree.  The inevitable Gulab Jamun was possibly the worst thing I've ever tasted.  It was kind of like chewing on a cotton ball soaked in rancid sugar water.  Breakfast was kind of a weird mashed potato affair with raisins and caraway seeds, and a cream cheese croissant.    Trader Joe's microwave Indian meals are far superior to the slop served on Air India.  
The Cabin crew were benign, but just a little clueless.  When I asked for a Vodka and tonic, the young lady whipped out a big bottle of some random Vodka I've never seen before, and poured about an ounce into a plastic cocktail tumbler.  She handed it to me, and gave me a can of room temperature tonic and started to leave.  I had to chide her to give me A) more Vodka, B) some ice cubes, and C) a few lime wedges.  I basically told her that I would keep bugging her for more drinks, if she didn't just give me what I wanted the first time.  
Basically, we flew Air India because it's the only non-stop.  Next time, we'll definitely re-think it."

Shortly after takeoff a passenger fell ill and the service after that was bad if you asked for something they would say we have a crisis on board and we would have to wait.
It could not have been too serious or we would have to make a detour but nevertheless all services slowed right down for the entire flight.
The inflight entertainment was about three years out of date and a lot of the passengers were saying that the headphones were not working properly and when I tried I could not get sound up high enough to hear properly fortunately I had my own and they were ok.
The main reason we chose Air India was in the old days when you flew into Mumbai 
You had to go half way round the airport for the next internal flight,but with Air India you flew into and out of terminal 2 so that was a lot easier.
On the return journey I must say that the flight was a lot better with much better service

AI126 has been delayed 8hours for departure (eta 21:30cst) on mar2nd 2019, and passengers will be notified once they arrive at the terminal (period).

If your destination is Delhi its 8hours delay, you would reach Delhi around 23pm IST instead of 15pm IST. AI126 is flight from ord-hyd with a 2/3 hours stop at Delhi. Now passengers travelling to hyd have a connection flight at Delhi early morning 6am IST, so it's a 7 hours waiting time. Top it, you got to do immigration check in at Delhi, take your luggage, walk to domestic terminal and recheck in the luggage.

We understand there is national security issues, but an airlines with so many years of operation doesn't have a backup plan/ route, Instead of making passengers suffer. 

Air india Staff at ord got an extra brain too, they say it's your problem to take luggage and recheck in, as if we booked ticket till delhi and a connection in morning. Have some life staff.

Its minimum courtesy for an airlines to communicate that their flight is delayed, passengers will make alternates. I don't want to mention how little ones were at ord during the horrible check in process.

It’s because of the context between India and Pakistan, who closed its territory to Indian aircrafts earlier today.

Tomorrow’s flight and probably the next ones are also going to be delayed and the duration will dramatically increase due to the new route.

Better not buying tickets with Air India for now, if you fly to South East Asia."

We didnt know you had to have a return flight. Shame Air India didn’t tell us this when we booked at not whilst we were putting the bags on the weigh machine. We were forced into buying a ticket at an inflated price to fly back at a time that didn’t suite us, but never mind because the air India rep, that’s the one that was nice, not the other one with attitude assured me that we could change the date to a date we wanted and this was free. Lie number one. We couldn’t and it was going to cost us another £76 each. When we got on the plane our pre booked seats were given to someone else and we were shunted to what we were told were better seats. Lie number 2. The seats were by the toilets and we had no window. One of our seats were broken so that one had no entertainment and no food table (pictured seat). Air India’s Dreamliner held together with tape. When we arrived at our hotel, I compiled a complaint and emailed air India, this failed to send so I contacted them through their fb page, they gave me an email address that also didn’t work. When I eventually got an email address I sent them my complaint, which the ignored, of didn’t respond to. I went on to email them another 6 or 7 times using any address that worked. Still no reply. I then contacted their fb message system and raised my issues with them they thought I wanted to tell them about the broken seat so they could get it fixed, they wanted everything bar the searial number of the seat. I explained I didn’t care about the repairing of the seat because there would be no way on earth I would fly with them. Went into air India today in Goa to cancel flights as there was no way I could fly with such a poor airline. Cancelled return flight rebooked with other airline. Further more safety issues on plane, one air host sat with no seat belt on take off and landing, not a big issue I know but if the pilot is going on about safety and putting on your seat belts it doesn’t set a very good example. And the other one on take of and landing who did wear his belt did the holy Mary cross on his chest, like he had no confidence in the chances of us getting on and off the ground.

Thats not a situation any traveller would want to get into. Another instance, 8 hours before the boarding the web checkin was throwing error. You reach airport to find that there is no seat. There is no communication from airline and passengers are queueing up. Upon escalation, they say that you go to some counter to get tikctes. When we get there we are asked to wait for hours before we get ticket for a night flight (more than 4 hours of waiting). On the same day, another flight was having the same situation at Air India and passengers were given option to fly next day!! These are not random instances.

From the check in desk to the flight attendants, everyone was warm, engaging, and proficient in meeting all needs. The plane was comfortable, clean had design features we had never experienced. An individual pouch at each seat, pre-stocked with bottled water, allowed us to be refreshed immediately on entering the plane. Each seat has a foot rest that can be positioned to suit you, and the shape of it allows you to massage your feet. Special baby beds that attach to the wall allowed families traveling with infants or toddlers to accommodate the child's needs brilliantly.
We also felt well cared for. Our meals were delectable and included options for vegetarians, including Jain selections. While dining we marveled at the efficiency of the delivery service. Small carts were used to quickly serve the delicious hot entrees, and coffee and tea are brought around with a pot on a tray, which seemed easier for the server and quite hospitable to us!

How I wish we could have taken the middle eastern planes instead with a layover for a cheaper price.  Air India’s flight attendants on our specific flight were so incompetent, unhelpful, and really could have cared less about their customers.  People were carelessly placing their bags in the overhead cabin in the wrong ways and they didn’t check to see if perhaps they could make more room for other people’s luggages.  The entertainment provided was also subpar, no new movies that just came out, and overall poor tv quality.  

They also didn’t have WiFi, and while I don’t really care about this factor too much because I do sleep great in long flights, I think any flights over 12-16 hours non-stop should at least provide this option, even if customers have to pay.  It’s 2019, Air India! Get with the program!  

The toilets were also dirty and unkempt.  Two of the different toilets I went to just didn’t look like any flight attendants have cleaned them in between.  At least once take a good look at the toilet condition.  

I’m always excited with long international flights and I can’t say I’ve ever had a negative experience, until this most recent flight.  It was very disappointing."

The aircraft interior on the Boeing 787 was a little tired. The layout was 2, 2 and 2. Flat beds that were very comfortable and spacious but not highly technical. Films on offer were a little dated etc but what really made up for all of that was the service. It was a good old fashioned service. Not overly done like most airlines. Not rushed. You are spoken to as Sir / madam all the time. They have the upmost respect for you. The service is planned so well that it kind of knew when you would be hungry. Thirsty and then needed sleep. Very well done. The crew could be seen but not heard. I think that’s the other way round on many airlines. You normally hear the crew chatting but hardly see them in the cabin. Not Air India. I would not hesitate to fly with them again. Just one thing missing. A toiletry bad. Every airline gives you one of these. It’s what airlines pride themselves in but Air India did not give these. I had slippers and a sleep shade. It was a day flight so maybe that’s why. "

Once inside the aircraft, the stewards found that there was less space for all the cabin luggage that had come in. The ground staff, then, very rudely started taking out cabin luggage and giving it to the passengers to keep under their seats to make room for bigger cabin baggages. One Mr Sunil was especially very rude. The stewards put their hands up and sated that it was the responsibility of the ground staff to see that extra cabin baggage does not come in so it is their responsibility to accommodate the baggage and if we did not want to keep the baggage under our feet we should of refused to take it from them. So they just passed the buck to the ground staff who were very high handed."

We flew from Heathrow to Delhi and back 9 days later for a Golden Triangle holiday. On the way out 2 of our 4 televisions would not work and when we called the staff over they just said that about a fifth of them weren’t working. There was no sorry and they said it like it was no problem. A 8.5 hour flight without a film is a very long flight! We swapped seats so our children could watch and we just had to go without. The food was very average.
On the return flight we were extremely frustrated and annoyed with the check in process. Not only is it the slowest check in process we have ever experienced from any airline but people kept being brought to the front by the staff, clearly paying to be allowed to push in. We know that India is a tipping culture but this is outrageous! The lady on the desk was very off with us as if we were an inconvenience. Very poor service!
Our televisions all worked on the return but again the food was bland. Not a great experience!"

The flight did get delayed by an hour but that actually was a good thing since we got to roam the T2 terminal of the Mumbai Airport and click lots of pictures while we were around. Coming to the flight the interiors were quite comfortable and the in-flight staff and attendants were truly professional and quite humble and friendly.

Coming to the food served, it was the first time I tried food on a flight but this was the highlight of flying with Air India. The food consisted of two pieces of mayonnaise vegetable sandwich, a fruit juice, a ragda pattice served hot and lastly a dessert consisting of brownie some fruits and fresh cream. 

Overall apart from the delay, the experience was by far the best I have experienced traveling by any flight so far. Definitely flying Air India would be my first choice when I book a flight ticked next time."

Took Air India Melbourne to Delhi because flight times suited.
Daytime flight on not overcrouded modern Dreamliner,,, Should have been fine..
We took off at Midday in daylight arrived after 12 hours at 5 pm still in daylight.
Except inexplicably the flight crew forceably darkened every window for almost the entire flight. 
Completely disorienting 
Presumably this was to keep us all quiet while minimising the circadian rhythm disturbance for the Delhi  based staff.
For someone leaving Australia made  no sense
Food old fashioned . Announcements unintelligible Safety demo beyond peremptory Pilots said nothing.  Cabin crew whom we had not seen throughout appeared just before landing.Delay landing not mentioned . Dramatic Hailstones after landing explained delay. Luggage soaked and damaged.

This was no use to us as we had hotels and safaris booked for 3 days which meant we lost 2 days. We emailed and were told we could have a refund. We informed our insurers to find we were covered in some circumstances. We travelled by car instead at great cost.
2 months on, no refund had come even though we had asked several times for the money. Eventually we contacted our insurers again who claimed the money back. Would never book again with air India."
"2019-02-25T00:32:53-05:00","3","review","1","Average experience for an average price","Flight departed and arrived on time - for both outbound and return journeys. Food and drinks were served efficiently.  Additional drinks (inc alcoholic) were provided upon polite request. Clean reclining seats, good enough entertainment system.  So all the basics were covered well.  
Food was good on the trip to Mumbai.  Even had an awesome choc brownie on the lunch tray. 

Downside, food on Mumbai to London trip could have been better. Description of food options lacking. Chose lamb, expected Indian lamb curry, got very bland lamb stew. With rice. So it's plane food as expected 10 years ago.  

Biggest downside by far . . . . The online checkin is not fit for purpose.  Verified the same experience by others on the flight - in case I had missed something.  You may be able to easily check in as an individual - but try to check in a family, and you'll waste time.  Managed to input all four family members passport details after a couple of attempts (website/page resets now and again) - then, before you can select seats, you're logged out with a message saying contact an agent to secure seats for a premium / charge.  Had this on both flights to and from India. Others confirmed same experience.  People who paid extra didn't get their premium seats, so the was plane held up while IA manager called in, and explained to Customers that this happens every flight, nothing he can do. No ownership, no accountability.  Utterly bonkers approach to Customer Service.  AI - How about this for a novel approach ' don't take the money if you know that you cannot provide the service being sold' I.e. The premium seat.
My experience at Goa airport was almost hilarious - managed to get online check in to work on airport web checkin facility a couple of hours before flying to Mumbai. Last minute to say the least.  This time, I managed to confirm seats on Goa flight and print boarding passes before AI desks opened for luggage drop (approx 3 am).  System logs me out. As far as system is concerned, I've checked in.  
 Desk agent asks - have you got your boarding passes for connecting flight to London?  I ask for advice on how to do that - agent replies: by using the web checkin facility. 
So we sat in different rows instead. 

Staff on the flight were good."

I'd say thefood given was definitely Economy Class food. when i went touse the toilet, thebowl was dirty and toilet paper stuck in the bowl, pointed this out to the steward, who did not do anything. i had to go in and cup my hands together under the tap there in the toilet and pour the water from my hands to loosen  the toilet paper which had dirt  on it. it eventually dislodged and then i had to flush it.By taking water from the tap i happened to spill some water on the floor, which i tried to wipe up and then i went out and called the steward to point out what i had done to clean the toilet bowl and that some water was still on the floor, so he grabbed some toilet paper and wiped the rest . then only, did i attend to my needs. so much for that."

This time I had to go via Delhi, and Air India was the only practical option. Having read the reviews I was dreading the experience. I had my antibacterial wipes to clean the seat area properly - so low were my expectations.

In total I had 4 flights on their 787 business class. Each was on time, or early. Service on EVA is impeccable, but somewhat sterile. On Air India they treat you like a guest - maybe not as polished service, but more genuine.

Compared to reverse herringbone seating, which is fast becoming the norm, the Air India cabin is very open in a 2-2-2 layout. A nice change.

Food was pretty good, but served as a single tray. Plenty of drink choices.

IFE was not great.

The biggest disappointment was the state of the interior of the planes. One was only 1.5 years old. Already shabby. On a 10 year old EVA it is still factory fresh.

The airline delayed my flight from Singapore to India, so I couldn't fly from India to Paris. When I arrived in India, one of the flight attendants was very calm and said, ""Your plane has already left,"" and I was so embarrassed and bewildered. And I went up to the person in charge and I talked about this, and the Air India said they could fly the next day, and they said they'd be able to provide the hotel by the next day. But I planned this trip with my friend. My friend also came to Paris from Korea alone. I didn't want to waste a day and kept asking the flight attendant. I said I wanted to board the fastest other flight, not the next day, but Air India kept telling me to wait. I waited for about three hours and asked the Air India representative again. My flight ticket was going on, but the person in charge asked me to wait again, asking me why I didn't buy the ticket. I felt like I had to wait until the next day. I bought the ticket myself and notified the person in charge. And the person in charge told me to wait and see. But I suspected it, and I told him again.Gaga showed me my ticket correctly. Then the flight attendant got annoyed with me about why he bought the ticket. And he told me I had to make a visa for delivery. The tickets I bought at that time were from India Delhi to Mumbai and Mumbai to Paris. But what I'd like to say is that if I had informed me before I bought this ticket, I would have thought about something else. But they didn't give me any exact information, and I had to pay to make a visa again. And I asked him about the refund process for my ticket, and he told me that he would give me a full refund if I sent him documents and emails. I've always wanted to deal with this problem in Paris, and I've been sending emails, but I'm just saying, wait for it. If it wasn't for the airplane problem on my trip, everything would be perfect. But because of airplane problems, I got a lot of stress and ruined my trip. The next time I have to go to another country, I don't want to use Air India again. Air India is really a delay-based airline, and there is no substitute for the guests on the Delayed flight. If the moment comes when you have to choose Air India, I hope you'll think again. Don't choose this airline if you don't want to be in the same situation as me. I spent 600,000 won on this trip because of airindia."

The transit facility at Chennai was extremely poor, inconvenient, harassing and tiresome. To start with, there were inadequate wheel chair arrangements at the aerobridge at Chennai airport. On deplaning we were asked to travel along a long corridor without anybody guiding us where to go. After walking for quite some distance we were asked to stand and wait ( no seating available)for opening of the gate to a hall as the key/security person was not present. Our documents were checked twice before entry. Thereafter, we were made to wait for a long time without adequate seating arrangements, then stand again in a long queue for another documents check, whereafter we went through a security check again for entry to the departure area. It was such a cumbersome and tiring process. I am sure Air India in conjunction with the Airport Authority of India can streamline the process of multiple shifting and checks to eliminate avoidable inconvenience and harassment to travellers."

Mind you- she is no one time traveler. She traveled many times before, traveled in Emirates business class before. And now she prefers only Air India (even over and above Emirates' flights). I  was pretty impressed that she was happy.  Here is her comparison to the experience - am putting her initial feedback on Emirates as well to get a perspective:

Checkin process- Airlndia (4), Emirates(4). Would have loved to not to wait for wheelchair (guess this is because of the airport)

Seating process/preflight experience- Air India (4), Emirates (3). Air India hostess apparently walked along with her till the seat, while the Emirates person just directed the seat. 

In flight entertainment- Air India (2), Emirates (5). Air India's entertainment was very bad and she didnt find anything good enough. Apparently- some of the passengers complained that their entertainment didnt work.

In flight dining- this is where Air India trumps over others. Air India (5), Emirates (2). Coffee and Yogurt was real good :) . Hindu Vegeterian  was super.

Help from Attendants- Air India (5), Emirates (3). Flight attendants actually wrote her customs form!! I loved this part too.

Most importantly- she also loved the fact that she didnt have to stop over in Dubai and experience ""rude"" staffers. Am not surprised to listen to this myself. I had encountered similar rude behavior myself in Dubai (yes, even in Business Class- the wheel chair attendant and the lounge attendant forgot to smile and wish in Dubai!!)

Thank you Air India for getting a rare compliment from  my mother!"

The check-in queue was very slow but we were assured on multiple occasions by the Air India staff that we would still be able to check-in and make our flight.  When we attempted check-in we were told abruptly (and contrary to the assurances given previously) that the flight was closed and we would not be able to board.  End of story.

Air India's ground staff were utterly useless, passing the issue from one inept/disinterested colleague to another.  No apology was given, no attempt was made to offer a refund or a re-booking and we were left to fend totally for ourselves.

Thankfully, the on-site concierge of the very excellent Leela Palace New Delhi (Air India's customer service teams would learn alot from them) were able to negotiate a comfortable road transfer from IGI to Jaipur, meaning that our lengthy trip to Delhi was not wasted.

A suitable email has been written to Air India, however I do not expect to hear from them.

Never flying Air India again.  Rubbish."

The flight was comfortable, the onboard service was courteous and professional.
Air India is now one of the very few airlines to serve dinner for all on board for free, irrespective of the ticket class , if you are flying dinner time.

The issue that I have experienced is in disgust at the level of no service from air India at all.
My parents left for a flight  02.02.19 in Business class from Heathrow airport, which they paid a lot of money for. £4000. The service on board was TERRIBLE. The TV didn't work, headphones didn't work. There was no complementary toiletry bag, in general the service was so bad, the hostesses were all rude and not very helpful, especially when assisting an elderly lady on board at trying to find her medication. It had dropped on the floor but none of them helped her look for it and then said she left it in the bathroom!!!!
My Mother dropped her phone at the side of the seat, someone came to assist her get it out but then said he couldn't and walked off. Another lady came an hour later and pulled it out.
The fact they paid £4000 for this experience is a rip off and disgusting behaviour from the staff and company. I should expect a good will gesture of part refund for this flight. 
Also, I called your customer service to make a complaint and even the person on the phone was rude and had no customer service skills at all.

I have since made a complaint on your website and through Resolver, however i have not had a responce from either.

I would avoid this airline at all cost - the fact that no one has replied to me with even an appology just shows what kind of an airline this really is!!!!!!!!"

Three days later the bag was delivered with a minimum of 3 calls a day to either Bombay, Delhi, or Hyderabad Air India baggage services.

Had booked this flight quite a months ago so got a reasonable return fare of 19K for three persons in economy. Also Air India has been running this promo of payed upgrade offer to next available class at just fraction of the original fare. Like we had the option of upgrading to business class for just around Rs 2K per seat which is quite a deal. But yes this is limited to seat availability.

The flight was an early one at 6 AM and the check-in was smooth at Delhi International Airport. Luggage was tagged and boarding pass given. Security check was quickly done and we were ready for boarding on time. In fact the flight started 5 minutes earlier. Take off was smooth with no events.

Seats were standard A320 seats and comfortable for short flights with comfortable leg room. One this that annoyed was that there was no pouch to keep small thing behind the seats like small water bottles, papers etc. This is a common feature which is found in all other A320's flying in India.

Breakfast was served after half an hour. Food was just average not quite spectacular nor too bad. Service was quite efficient and on time.

There was quite bad turbulence while the flight was half an hour to Chennai which is kind of scary. It persisted for around 20 mins and then smoothed out.

It took around 2:30 hours of actual flight time to reach Chennai and not including the tarmac time. Even though we reached before time the luggage took quite some time to arrive which is quite annoying for an International Airport like Chennai. But can be understood that this is govt controlled airport unlike in Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore.

Overall a nice flight with Air India this time and would definitely try them in future."

We happened to check about a week before we flew in order to deal with seat allocation, but found that the flight appeared cancelled. 
No word from Air India.
It had indeed been cancelled, we found out, because 26th January is India's National Day and for a few hours EVERY YEAR Delhi airspace is closed.
WHY ADVERTISE A FLIGHT THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY TAKE TO THE AIR?Especially as this happens on the same date every year!!
When contacted, they said we had been rebooked on a 7.30 a.m. Flight. When told that we could not physically make that flight, they more or less told us, tough luck and because we rebooked you, no reimbursement.
Are they totally incompetent, uncaring and useless? Or just unbelievably cynical?
After the hassle of this, a couple of days later,  they belatedly sent a bland e mail advising that the flight had been cancelled......BIT LATE AIR INDIA!!!
We ended up having to re arrange our schedule and went from Chandigargh to Delhi by train.

The aircraft was in dire need of repairs, torn seats, non-functioning audio/video system, and smelly restrooms.  Cabin service was a typical example of government employees dedication - cold food which they themselves would not care to eat, very poor response to passengers' genuine requests, etc.  There are plus points also--the timings are excellent, especially the arrival time in Delhi.

Basic common sense. It just makes so much more sense to give out the seats in a serial order when several people are travelling together. 

Yes Sir India is also known for competent pilots..but Air India is known more famously for flight delays and rude air hostesses. 

That it has held tight to its signature trademark low quality and poor manners...in an era of suave air hosts and budget flights option is a miracle..truly amazing. 

We had arrived early at the airport as my ageing 80+ mother who has been traveling for the last 60 year always does..we always get to the airport hours early.

Throughout our lives, this early to airport, early to check-in/Immigration has kept us healthy and wise. It has helped ensure us  smooth check ins and general stress free airport journeys. 

This time however I had had a fall and was in a wheelchair. An urgent trip came up. My elderly mother has been in the wheelchair for sometime now. We both needed assistance. My little grandson accompanied us. 

At the entrancee of the flight we were suddenly asked to walk by ourselves to our sear despite there being a host of air hosts standing right there. We pleaded for assistance. Which was conveniently ignored. Both my mother and I are tiny small people..not tall or obese at all..

Further...as we fumbled inside the flight...we all 3 of us had been assigned different seats...this has never happened in any other flights before.

We were not helped with our in-flight luggages till I begged and pleaded the very able bodied airhost.  

One healthy looking stewardess snubbed us saying that she has backpain and cannot carry the 6kg luggage.  Someone so ill should not take this as a hosting profession. 

This experience was  pretty similar to that Air India Express we once took to Kuala Lumpur. Lousy flight...lousier air hostesses. 

In this competitive age, to survive please hire people with good interpersonal skills. 

Air India and Air India Express, neither are you cheap nor clean nor friendly, learn a thing or 2 from Indigo and Jet Airways, my top choices for Indian flights .

Air India stands by this policy of carrying meals from India for return flights but clearly, its causing issues for them and they're in a state of denial.

I’m just speechless at the incompetence of this carrier. Firstly, they brought forward the flight by 5 hours from Delhi to Dharamsala without telling us. We were in transit from Australia so even if they told us we won’t be able to make it anyway. Than the show of ‘go to this counter and then to other counter’. After a huge protest they booked next day flight and gave us a hotel. Really substandard hotel. Wasted our day. On the way back they cancelled the flight at last minute when all the passengers are sitting at the airport in Dharamsala. Again after a protest as we will our Singapore airline flight from Delhi to Australia, they sent us in a taxi to another Airport two hours away (Pathankot). Flight there was also delayed but we end up making our connection. Staff is rude, inconsiderate and don’t care about the guests at all. Typical public service. Don’t use this airline and if you do than expect last minute delays, horrible service and substandard food. 

I won’t even give them a rating so it’s a zero out of ten from me. Just disgusted by this experience."

The flight attendant Tarek was extremely rude to me and would not serve me at all. I have never been treated so badly on a flight before- it actually made me sick to my stomach. He was extremely threatening to me- I asked for a glass of wine and he denied me. He told me to “not treat him that way”. I pay money for this service, and to be treated as if I am a second class citizen. I will never ride Air India ever again- you have officially lost me as a costumer and I will make sure no one ever wants to ride Air India again. I will waste my time posting a negative review on ever site I can- that is how upset I am. There is a group of men next to me who are being extremely loud and the fight attendants are no doing nothing about it. They are making kissing sounds at me, yet when I tell the flight attendants they tell me to just ignore it. I expect to be treated with respect when I’m on a flight, and am truly disgusted that you hire flight attendants like Tarek who treat people like second class citizen.  I am so disappointed in this service- I truly hope no one ever has to ride Air India again. I will write a bad review on ever site so no foreigner has to go through what I went through. I read the poor reviews and still trusted this airline- what a mistake on my end. I will ensure no American will be treated this way by warning people before they decide to book with you. I truly hope you fix your service because you have lost many costumers on this site (aka I am not the only one who is very upset)"

Took two Air India flights, the first from Newark, New Jersey to Mumbai on a Boeing 777. Flight left a little early and arrived a little early. The rest of what I write applies to business class only. Service was attentive. During the course of this long flight, two full meals were offered. In addition, sandwiches, alcoholic, and non-alcoholic beverages were available. If you select your meal in advance any dietary preference can be met (Hindu vegetarian, Buddhist vegetarian, Jain vegetarian, Halal, gluten-free, etc.). Otherwise, meals are Indian with a few western options. The food is good. There is a curtained off section in Business Class for women living in seclusion.
 
First and business class travelers have access to the Virgin lounge which is very nice.
The advertised flat seats are not quite flat and my controls were balky. However, they are comfortable enough, there is a lot of leg room. Real duvets, not those skimpy airline blankets, and comfortable pillows are available for sleeping. I would take this airline again.

The second flight was from Kolkata on a Boeing 787, also business class. This is a wonderfully comfortable airplane. The food is Indian--vegetarian or non-vegetarian, and good.

Business class lets you board and deplane first and your check-in luggage comes off the plane first. These are big advantages in crowded India.

Hence, it was a transfer within the international terminal of Mumbai's Airport. We just managed to get on board to this EWR flight as our flight from Chennai was delayed by more than 90 minutes !! 
The flight to Newark ( EWR) is about 15+ hours, nonstop from Mumbai. The aircraft was not packed to its capacity, so there was some flexibility in storing personal items near the seat. Also, the toilets were easily available all through the flight. The food was served as per our reservation request. The food and the service was decent. I liked the red wine. The onboard entertainment did work and it was helpful to use it between the sleeping laps. The seats, once fully reclined ; were comfortable enough for sustaining this long haul flight. The cabin temperature was bit cold, but with blankets on, it was cozy. 
The flight landed a bit ahead of time at EWR  on a brilliant, beautiful, sunny morning of New Jersey winter ! The immigration was swift and by the time we came down to the baggage carousel, our bags were on the belt!

This 1 hour turned up in 7,5 hours (!!!!!!) locked in a plane, because the pilot left the aircraft because his shift was over and there was no other pilot for this plane. 

Indian people were calling police and told them we are hijacked ( which we actually were). We couldn't leave the plane. They would not give us the lugage back. 

This nightamare was done after 7,5hours, when they officially canceled the flight. 
Before they do so, you cannot get any refund back - that's why all the people were waiting for so long.

"2019-02-04T15:32:53-05:00","1","review","4","Horrible International Flight experience every time","This is the worst International airline I have taken ever. I flew with them the second time. 
My experience didn't change at all this time as well. The flight from SFO to Delhi departed 40 minutes past the scheduled time, though everything incl. boarding was done on time. When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some commercial reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service compared to any other international airline. Most of the LCD screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience. 
There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market. 
I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. The fish market was back in action. The in-flight entertainment deserved black and white movie award. 
I am no Aviation Industry expert. But I can promise one thing- Give me the operations job for 6 months and I will make sure that this airline meets the basic international norms. 
Indian Govt. and airline industry should take a serious note of this and possibly stop their operations until it's improved"

The bags are checked through to EWR or JFK or SFO or O'Hare as the case may be. This is a smart move. But then the connection time is important. 
The flight was delayed by more than an hour and we ended up having only 45 minutes to transfer ourselves in Mumbai into the Newark flight.  Thanks to the immigration done in Chennai, we managed to be at the gate for EWR almost at the last minute. But it was a big sweat ! Thus, it's not a good idea to take this flight from Chennai if one is connecting in Mumbai onwards to EWR.
We remained tense all through the flight! Don't even remember if we had dinner !!

However the service was efficient and the plane was comfortable. We were offered a toiletry bag (tick), pyjamas (tick)  and complimentary head phones(which were a bit sub-standard). After take-off we were offered lunch which was probably better than Economy but not as good as I have had on other Business Class flights. There was wine and other beverages on offer with meals although not showing on the menu. After that it was unclear what further meals were to be offered. For some reason they  offered supper about 4 hours out of  Sydney which seemed to me when most people would have been wanting to sleep. This or some alternative could have been offered earlier in the night. On  the plus side  - the beds lay flat and there were nice blankets, pillows etc and the flight left and arrived safely and on time."

We left Goa almost 2 hours late after scheduled time. We were told that we wouldn't lose the connection because the plane that we were going to fly from Goa would stop in Mumbai, get new passengers and continue direct to Delhi. When we arrived to Mumbai we were surprised as they told us to go out, together with another passengers to the counter E and check in again. We already had checked in back in Goa. We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us. We went all together and the surprise was that everyone boarded  and we were refused. They told us that our names were deleted from the passengers list. The staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen, claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won't make it on the CPH plane. We looked at the plane from departure gate, leaving the hub at 14:43. That is when the nightmare started. The staff at the gate told us that our bags haven't even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list. We spend 8 hours at the airport trying to solve our problem. Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened, lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism. From the staff from the gate (4 people), we were pushed to another group of staff, then another staff and so on. They didn't admit the mistake they have made moreover, they claimed that we were late for the plane and that's why we lost it. We were fighting with everyone trying to get the true and they were sugarcoating us all the time. We were not the only ones at the airport with similar situation to ours. They even didn't want to give us hotel to spend the night. After fighting a lot they gave us a really bad and disgusting Hotel. During all day we were with no food and no water. Additionally, our bags went missing so we had no clothes to change or any hygiene appliances with us.We had a very bad ending of our holidays because of Air Indias' staff incompetence.

But this particular flight was very disappointing, due to several shortcomings. First the onboard entertainment system didn't work for all the 3 seats, we were in row 38. For over 2 hours the crew tried various tactics, nothing worked. So, we had to either forcefully sleep or eat  or just sit tight as reading a book was not an easy option with overhead lights, for the next 13 hours. So boring it was ! Next, we had pre-booked special meal ( AVML) long , long ago while the tickets were purchased, but the crew told us that they ran out of Indian food, and offered us pastas and some vague stuff. We refused the offer. We told that we were willing to go hungry, but then somehow they pulled out 2 trays for us from somewhere. Next, on a 15+ hour flight, the crew never offered Coffee/Tea except the occasions of lunch/dinner. I had to walk up to the far end of the aircraft at the back to the pantry area to fetch the coffees. Then,  unfortunately, the passengers around us were talking loud and were constantly eating something or the other such as Khakraas etc which they brought along with them , passing it back and forth between the seats making a mess of our seats. The crew never intervened to advise them to be calm. 
The drinking water was not a constraint as the crew had kept a few bottles in the midway pantry areas, all left for the passengers to fend themselves.
One of the few positives, the toilets were generally/ periodically cleaned up. 
The check-in at Newark was a mess, though the airline had a couple of staff regulating the queue. We had done web check-in,  but it took a while to figure out the  dedicated counter for web check-in bag drop,  that did save us tons of time.
Despite the stressful time those days for the TSA staff with shutdown running into 4th week, they handled the security screening swiftly, efficiently and professionally. 
The flight took off a bit late at EWR , but did arrive in Mumbai on-time. However, the arrangement by Air India at Mumbai for transferring the passengers to connecting/ onward flight was pathetic. It took almost an hour and half after landing for us to get to the lounge. 
Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. 
I force myself to patronise Air India, being the National carrier of India; much as every Japanese is proud to patronise JAL or every Korean is proud to fly Korean Air , or  every Singaporean prefers Singapore Airlines , and  so on with almost every national carrier.
Wonder whether Air India ever be a world-class airline and would ever invoke that pride of being the carrier of India ??"

On my return from Mumbai to London I asked at check in if there was a possibility to upgrade to business and I was told I would need to ask at the gate. But when I did so I was told I couldn't pay by card, only cash. I don't know how much the upgrade would have been as we didn't get that far, but I would imagine it would have been approx £400.

Air India took no responsibility of the helpless situation we were put in due to abrupt cancellation. The passengers were by their own! As I was running out of time, I quickly boarded the Airport taxi for which i am going to pay 4000.00 INR and yes i will get my total refund of 2381.00 INR by Air India.
This Horrifying experience cost me a fortune, wasted my time and left me in total frustration. I will never book a flight from Ludhiana Airport specially with Air India.

I was traveling from Jaipur to Delhi, Delhi to JFK flight. My Jaipur - Delhi flight was on a separate PNR as I booked it later however we spoke on the phone at the customer service and was told that our luggage can be allowed from Jaipur itself since we have a connecting Air India  flight within 12 hrs. 
I was carrying 2 pcs and one poster roll separately. I was told at the counter  that my luggage can be checked in uptill JFK in Jaipur itself. 
First the guy at the Jaipur counter told me that  I will be charged 1 pc extra. I said, Okay I will just pay and get it done with. After going up to the other counter I learnt that the charge will be for 240 dollars. I was shocked, I thought might as well leave it in Jaipur itself. I went back to the counter to negotiate and they agreed to send all of my stuff as the total weight was also coming within the permitted limit. I felt very thankful and thanked the staff in Jaipur for the same as they checked my luggage in till JFK. I am a 23 yr old girl and was travelling alone. They were really generous towards me.
My flight was at 8.10 pm from Jaipur and Our flight was delayed for 2 hr 45 minutes. Next flight to JFK from delhi was at 1.35 am (on time). 
I reached delhi at 11.00 pm and rushed to Transfer check in counter for my boarding pass. There were three people sitting and all were as usual getting yelled at by the frustrated passengers. I waited, I was ensured by the staff  that everything will be smooth for me. 
All of a sudden, A staff named I think Mr. AVIDESH YADAV, (extremely RUDELY) insisted that I need to pay 240 dollars or else they will not issue me my ticket!!!! He was not ready to listen to me.
I was taken aback, I asked him as to why am I being asked NOW, I should have been asked in Jaipur itself, coz then I would have left the paper roll (Had I required to pay that much amount). I told them it’s just like a poster roll. They were not even ready to take the roll out as it was already checked in. He made me feel as if I am lying. After fighting and arguing (when it was not even one hour left for my JFK flight) I had no option but to agree because they told me they will not give me my boarding pass. I was sent to the other floor (the main departures floor) where the lady sitting on the last counter, don’t remember her name. Extremely ruthlessly told me, without even listening to me, that I SHOULD FIRST CHECK THE TYPE OF MY TICKET.
I have never dealt with such a rude staff. They claimed that Jaipur staff is different, I told them that you all represent Air India. And why am I being asked now 40 min prior to my flight. I was crying because they harassed me so much. They said that I need to pay or else I will be not allowed to enter the flight. They told me I AM AT FAULT THAT I GOT TICKETS DONE LATE AND NOT ON THE SAME PNR. I AM AT FAULT THAT I DIDNT INSIST THE JAIPUR STAFF FOR A BOARDING PASS THERE AN THEN (which was not allowed obviously). 
I paid 240 dollar plus tax, INR 17950 rs. 
40 min before boarding pass was issued. I was rushed and entered the flight 30 min prior departure. 

This is complete cheating. They took advantage of the situation. Made me pay because I had no option. I wanted to leave that poster roll. But my entire luggage was checked in uptill JFK. Air India lacks internal coordination. They asked for money for a small piece of roll.

I ask them, how can they compensate for the time wasted for 3 hours when my flight was delayed due to technical issue in the aircraft??! And the rush and stress created because of lack of time between my flights??! 
I was going on a 15 hour flight after that, imagine my state of mind. 

They were completely UNAPOLOGETIC.

At my first stop over I was told we had to switch planes which originally was meant for Mumbai but now brought us to Delhi with connection from there to Varanasi, my final destination. I’ve flown to India in the past and noticed a similarity in the ticket where I only had an hour to get from one plane to the next but I was told I had to go through security get my bags, line up at air India get a new boarding pass again then get on my flight. I knew this was impossible so I asked the clerk if there were any changes I could make, with a grin on her face she said, you’ll have to deal with it in India. Upon reaching Delhi (where I was never meant to be) I made it through to the gate just as they were closing only to be told that I was late and just like last time, had to buy a new ticket (at no fault of mine) out of pocket if I wanted to get to my destination. When I asked about my luggage they went on the plane and got it for me.. makes sense ya?! At this point they had no other options for me to get to Varanasi so I was stranded in a city I had no intention of being at and had to make all new plans fast or else miss out on the rest of my travels. Long story short, took me over 46 hours to reach my destination which I ended up taking a train to after being stranded in Delhi, a city I knew nothing about.
Considering this has happened twice, and friends have experienced the same thing.. if you’re a tourist, air India will book your flights very close together knowing you’ll have to buy a new ticket never offering new flight options, help or reimbursement for the flight they were responsible for getting you to. Horrible service, horrible situation.. 
do not fly air India."

I changed my plans and travelled to Delhi to pick up the flight there. I was told at check-in that I could not check in until I had cancelled the flight from Kolkata. I went to Air India reservations to do that and they told me that I would be fined, and that my ticket to Birmingham was now invalid and that I would have to buy a new one. In all they charged me about £400 and told me I would not be able to board my flight until this was paid. I was appalled, though i recognise that I should have notified them that I would not be using the Kolkata-Delhi part of the flight. There threat to leave me stranded at the airport struck me as unethical and questionably legal. Many travellers would have maxed out their cards after three weeks in India and would not have been able to pay this,
So I have paid twice for the same flight; Delhi to Birmingham. And I have paid a fine for not using a flight I had already paid for though not used."

"2019-01-28T08:13:06-05:00","1","review","3","The worst experience in Bus Class on ANY airline","The captain of the aircraft asked for feedback. I offered that feedback to the airline on their site and they never replied. So, here is my review for all to see:

1-The planes are so old that sockets are falling out of the seat and the seats don't work properly.
2-Seats are somewhat broken and really uncomfortable
3-No amenity kit
4-No menus 
5-Flight Attendants get angry when you can’t hear them whispering to you and you need them to repeat what they say 5 times - raise your voice a little and perhaps we will hear what the heck you are saying.
6-No decent movies or about 15 to choose from if it even works
7-Low Def TV screens on these planes are not even worth the trouble of turning them on.
8-The screen off button doesn’t work. It comes on several times per minute and then shuts itself off. It has a mind of its own because they were not making any announcements. 
9-When I looked around I could see not one screen showing anything but the orange screen and for 15+ hours!
10-Lower your expectations very low indeed - Bus Class on this airline is about as good as Premium Coach on most others.
11-Service is abominable. They don’t check-in with you unless you stop them while they walk by or hit the call-button. They walk by all the time without asking anything
12-Airport people in Delhi were obnoxious when Coach was boarding and we asked where the Bus Class line was. The man basically ignored us for even asking and waved us off. 

Don’t bother with feedback on their site because it’s pretty obvious they don’t care. The feedback people must be overwhelmed or overcome with feedback because they don’t even respond.

And of course, no WiFi!

Never again. Never will I step foot in one of Air India's planes for a long-haul or ultra-long0haul flight and I hope you don't either. It's absolutely the worst."

So Air India have the dream liner and this is where the experience stops. Check in and boarding were not a problem. Plenty of legroom though the seats were not very clean. The middle seat next to mine was broken which doesn't bode well for the person sitting in it for a 9 hour plus journey. The entertainment is second rate - the Hollywood movies were supposed to be the latest and were in fact 2-3 years old. The stewardess, serving us, on the flight out looked like the most unhappest person I have ever seen. Everything was too much trouble and nothing was done with a smile. The food serviced wasn't so bad, was hot though a little too spicy for me. Don't get fooled by the easy transit through Delhi when you land. Surprisingly you still have to go through security again. Not sure why and again not sure why this process takes so long. People in the security queue were panicking as they had flights to catch and none of the airport staff seemed to care. All in all don't expect too much from Air India and you won't be disappointed."

When we arrived in Mumbai, we had already been delayed and had to sprint through the whole airport to catch our flight to Frankfurt. 
The Airline decided to wait for one passenger before going, which resulted in a 1h 10min delay upon arrival in Frankfurt.

Because of this we missed our flight to Copenhagen.

Now the nightmare begins..
We went to Lufthansa Service point who tried to figure out where we should go, only to find out that Air India apparently hadn't rebooked our ticket for a later flight. After waiting for three and a half hours the woman from Lufthansa had to give up, and told us to go to Air India or simply just buy a new ticket.

We went down to the Air India counter, and the guy there said something like ""I tried everything but now that you are here I have to try again"". Getting gradually more frustrated we still calmly tried to explain to the man that it is the Airline who has the responsibility to get passengers on the next available flight and he responded that the problem is that we bought the tickets online?? WTF. After 'trying' many times and continously trying to blame us saying something like it was a problem that we originally had paid our tickets in Danish Crowns, some other guy finally managed to fix us a flight almost five hours later. 

This company is so extraordinary unprofessional and you will not have a reliable trip travelling with them.

Bonus: an Air India employee scammed us in Delhi airport and took out our luggage from a connecting flight, only getting us back in if we bribed him 1.000 inr. (I didnt make a review about that before now since I was on holiday)

On board also. The food was delicious, staff amazing, very clean planes and with red carpet (I almost felt like royalty ;) lol!). Their bathrooms on board the plane even have hand disinfectant, hand lotion and even some perfume, have not seen that on any of my other flights using different airlines. This was a plus for me, especially when traveling such long distances.

We needed to change our return flight due to this ordeal, and Air India was a horror to deal with in the midst of this terrible experience.  Most international airlines waive Date Change fees when health emergencies are concerned -- but Air India charges the max of $300, and ripped us off for the fare difference as well, although we were changing our flight from a peak week to a much less busy travel week.  Half their customer service agents over the phone were extremely incompetent and very rude.

There was no issue with check-in and boarding; the staff behaved well and there was a serving of tea & coffee with cakes, biscuits and sweets--all at free of cost which we missed badly during our return flight by Indigo Airlines. Their staff were polite in their demeanour but offered us snacks, tea and coffee  at a cost (exorbitant); nothing was served free except a cup of drinking water! This really matters as and when their flight gets delayed due to bad weather or technical snags and passengers have to remain stranded long hours prior to boarding. Besides, their flight-fare is comparable to that of Air India. If Indigo pays due attention to this strategic issue i.e. become more professional by serving  free snacks & coffee/tea to its passengers without any extra charge, their business would definitely boom. I have listened to many passengers alleging this lapse in the basic service(which may hardly cost @Rs. 100--150/-  per ticket) which certainly won't eat away their profit margin rather would pay for."

His is a beautiful clean Airport Terminal. I got my boarding pass

My flight was at one o'clock in the night. We arrived here about 2 hours ago. I was with my wife. It was a great surprise to see here that almost all the shops of food were closed at night. One or two which was opens were giving simple sandwich too expensive, you can take this food on the half-rate right here in the day.

I travelled in economy class seats were very comfortable in comparison with other Airlines as indigo or goibibo. Here you can straighten your feet. services provided during the flights were satisfactory . Quality of food was also satisfactory .

The hurting feature was Treatment of luggage .The luggage is kept in a very negligent way, it is common for luggage to get scratched.

This is in sharp contrast to other airlines who are very professional almost at same price. I will give just one star to services.
Food was nice and fresh but with nothing as second serving or preferred serving.
The video screens also needed maintanence and were not working.
Exactly it was same experience during returning flight. There was only one young steward in the serving staff and was managing the show frantically.

As a result of this delay, I missed my original connection (LH 238), scheduled to leave at 16:00. When I exited the first aircraft I was informed by ground staff that if I won’t make the connection they will put me on the AZ 407 flight at 18:15. However, the Air India counter at the airport absolutely refused to do this and claimed they “could not get in contact with Alitalia”. Then they put me on the 21:55 Lufthansa flight to Rome- causing me to spend over 6 hours in a layover at Frankfurt (three times what was originally planned). This completely ruined my bookings in Rome for the 11th and caused me great discomfort. Additionally, the counter representative was unnecessary rude, it was clear he didn’t care to help at all, the Lufthansa representatives were more helpful! 

As someone flying business you expect a small kit of amenities - however they didn’t even provide passengers with a basic toothbrush. 

Food was of very poor quality. Not inedible but I would advise you to take a small packed meal for the journey.

Somehow cannot understand the beverage service. They serve liquor when you are about to reach SFO. I think they should change the schedule. At times you might face issue with toilets as the fellow passengers do not understand that they cannot throw anything there. There could be challenge with your entertainment unit and you might not get to see anything throughout the flight. Seat's neck rest does not work (none of them).

"2019-01-07T20:24:17-05:00","1","review","1","Dirty And Disinterested","The horror started at check-in where there's 2 working check-in counters for multiple flights. The counter employees were doing their best but the queues were simply too long. 
While all this is happening, these pompous and entitled looking fellows walk up to an empty counter that said ""Staff"" and started demanding that one of the two counters that were serving the now more than 100 people queuing up be closed so the employee at that counter could serve their entitled staff check-ins first. I mean come on! that is just, well sad. It's like the age old example of how Indian Government employees work to serve themselves.
At one point a flight attendant needed to cross the queue and instead of saying something like ""Excuse me"" she said ""Tsch Tsch!!"" and waved her hand at me to move like I was a prisoner standing in queue to get my grub.

Well, the next amazing thing was the plane itself, an Airbus 319, 11 years old which isn't that old by aircraft standards. but the cabin looked like the last time it was cleaned was 11 years ago. There was visible dust floating around the cabin, the seat covers had a thick layer of this dust, there were stains on the cabin walls. 

I'm going to try my best to avoid flying Air India as much as possible in the future."

However, let's start with specifics and not allow anger to overcome this airline. With the name AirIndia (you'd assume it's a flagship airline for the country), you'd expect somewhat of a good experience. The nonstop flight from JFK to Delhi had no working TVs. The seats were broken, dirty and just plain disgusting. I asked for water 10 times only to receive it the 11th time. I missed my opportunity to purchase business class however the seats for business are palpable for what you get with the amount paid for in this airline. I would avoid this airline at all costs. Only silver lining is that on the way back from Delhi to JFK the staff was a lot more tolerable and the TVs worked. However, there were brown smears on the seats, broken and just disgustingly dirty seats. I will say, the legroom was nice - but still a very terrible experience. It's no fault to the staff however because their air planes are probably the worst-maintained of all airlines I've flown. Next time, I'd fly Aeroflot. Never making that mistake again. Also, during the screening of packages in India, they missed a power adapter and withheld my luggage in India for 2 days before releasing it. They only released it after I sent them the same information 3 separate times."

All passengers boarded at LHR on time. We were then told that there maybe a 10 min delay which was being resolved by the technicians. It was approx a 2hrs. During this time very little was communicated to us from the flight deck. 
Once we were airborne I asked an attendant what arrangements were being made for us with the connecting flight. I was told was that we would not make the connecting flight and that all arrangements would be advised to us once we had landed, by Air India staff.
There was no information once we had landed. 
It turned out that there were approx 50 of us in a similar situation. Air India had at least 6 hrs before we landed to organise something for us. 
 Our bags had been tagged in LHR to go all the way to Goa and we were told that there was no need to go through Immigration until we reached Goa. Instead we (50 of us) were directed from the Transfer Desk to Immigration back to the Transfer Desk and then back to Immigration. Where we then had to pick up our bags and rebook ourselves onto the next available flight with Air India. 
Communication by Air India was dreadful, to say the least. We just kept being passed on to someone else. 
I have attempted to complain to Air India but their website is totally non user friendly.
I am now hoping that our return journey home later this month is without any issues. However one thing I am certain of is that I and 50 others will never be travelling with Air India again."

My experience in the last 6 flights I have taken of which 4 on Delhi-Hk-Delhi and 2 on Delhi-HK and Shanghai-Delhi on not too much of a happy one.

While timings suits me the best all other factors leave much to be desired.Cost wise no longer competitive with likes of Spicejet flying on this route with 20% lower fare.inflight meal Delh-HK is terrible with soggy spring rolls and cannot have more than a bite.11.15pm flight, passenger checks in at 8.30, has left home at say 7pm why no Dinner??Then at least give a heavy snack.The food tray is worst than a domestic flight 9f a normal carrier like jet airways.Inflight entertainment is never changed and for last 3 months have seen same menu.Indian music with 'oldies' or Ghazals is not there at all.

So should I be flying Air 8bdia only because it has the good timing that suits my schedule? Have to think about it.Another thing..Sir India was always generous complimentary upgrade and about 2- years back I could count on at least 2 upgrades every year incl international routes.But not any longer, I have not got an upgrade for over 3 years inspire of the fact I see empty seats in business class.

Further the only good feature to mention is that thecFrequent Flyer Program has recently got very active.However still more needed.For eg in Jet on any overseas flight 24-48 hrs prior to flight an offer for upgrade is received but even if there are offers like 'bid for upgrade' it should come in the mail before departure else you leave it to us to open website and try to do it.Pkease make all this customer friendly.Hoping for better days ahead"

All was fine on the way there and the man in charge of serving us was very good. The cabin is a bit dated compared to other airlines but probably reflected in the cheaper fares. No problem!
On the way back on 4th January we got to check in and they had allocated us seats that were not together, even though we had checked many times and had email confirmation that flying as a family we would, at worst, be 2 seats together and 2 seats together elsewhere. They sent us the seat numbers by email so we were happy with the seating plan. The check in staff at Air India said nothing they could do, one of our seats was broken. They had put my 5 year old girl sitting next to a random passenger on a 2 seat together configuration. After much protestation they told us, nothing they could do and to sort it out with the passenger on board and see if he would move seats. Unbelievable, since we paid around £7000 for what was meant to be a treat after working hard all year.
We embarrassingly asked the passenger if he wouldn’t mind moving, which he wasn’t best pleased about. He didn’t really have much choice when there’s a young family looking at him! The chief steward assured him he would be on his own with no one sitting beside him as the chair was broken next to him. Within a few minutes someone else got on and this extremely rude steward sent him to our ‘broken seat’. When I protested and said ‘why did you tell us it was broken, caused tension the whole of check in and made another passenger feel really bad uncomfortable’ , he basically shooed me away like he was swatting a fly away. How he is the chief steward I will never know! I didn’t want to make a scene for everyone else on board so had to leave it. Completely ruined the trip home.
Flight AI 131 - Mumbai to London - 0700 hours - the steward really needs retraining. The power of being in charge of the business class cabin has seriously gone to his head!
I wouldn’t recommend flying Air India and will try and find the extra funds to fly with a different airline.

Where do we start? Checking with Air India takes for ever. How can a simple process take so long for every passenger compared to other airlines? EasyJet excepted?
Flight departure was delayed as we were advised it arrived late into Delhi. Was departing from gate lounge 7 but then was shifted to gate lounge 26. Now that is a cut lunch away on other side of terminal building. Flight boarded one hour late. Once airborne settle in for the flight, watch a movie, etc. to fill in the time. 
Touch screen did not work, entertainment system slow to respond from hand held controller. Then went to plug in head set the plug socket was broken, no sound. Great!!! Middle seat between us would not stay fully up. Pressed attendant button. No one came and then just reset. Tried again, still no one came. Michelle was not going to use her screen or head phones. We swapped seats. Three guesses, same problems, seat plug broken and head seat also missing plug end. Again, tried to get flight attendant. Then I noticed a lot of blue lights around me, obviously many others were having problems. Then they rebooted the entertainment system. I obtained another head set and managed to get some sound by jiggling the headset in the socket hole. Sound was very soft and mono sound but had some sound but kept falling out if bumped.
The rest of the flight was uneventful, food is not great,  some staff appear to have some attitude that they are better than some of people on flight. If want a drink, have to go and find one as very limited service to seated passengers.
Toilet paper, seems to be Indian thing and have to bring your own as none in toilets 10 minutes after seat belt sign off. We did bring own as had this experiance before on previous Air India flights. Toilets are not maintianed during flight so imagine how it is after 10 hours, no soap, no hand towls as probably used as toilet paper, etc.

Overall it was not a cheap flight and there is an expectation that the aircraft is serviceable. The 787 Dreamliner is not old aircraft so one has to wonder if the internal passenger equipment does not work and or is not maintained, what about the important bits to make sure we arrive safely at our destination.
Lift your game Air India as there is plenty of cheaper and better airlines occupying the same routes."

The check in was fine and the staff were very helpful. The flight itself was uneventful and very short so no issues at all. We were not expecting much in terms of food and beverages. The plane itself appeared to be reasonably new as you could smell that new leather smell of the seats.
Overall very good for a short distance flight and we would do it again."

We were offered breakfast after takeoff (11am) followed by a hot lunch mid way through the flight and sandwiches towards the end.  For whatever reason this daylight flight was turned into an evening flight by turning off the lights and dimming the side windows (and overriding passenger ability to change window tint, a nice 787 feature).

After arriving in Delhi two and a half hours late, we had missed the connection to Sri Lanka. The Air India ground staff in Delhi were the most arrogant, smug, insensitive and pathetic group of travel staff. They provided no apologies, no options. 

After having to insist they help me (note if you try and strongly advocate for yourself these thin skinned people will get offended) I left my passport on the counter to reach in my bag and get a pen, and the counter staff TOOK MY PASSPORT, LIED ABOUT IT AND SAID THEY DIDN’T HAVE IT. 

Image being in an airport and not being able to find your passport all while the disgusting staff had it all along and snickered about it. 

My travel companion had to go up to the counter and get it back. This is such unbelievable behavior by staff of a Star Alliance airline. I have reached out to Air India staff as well as local managers in Delhi about this but a combination of laziness, language barrier and disinterest has left me without a resolution thus far. 

I can’t imagine stealing someone’s travel documents are acceptable behavior to this airline but I haven’t been told otherwise yet..."

They also weren't the full pods which I have seen in other business class international flights so you didn't have quite the same privacy.   

The screens, due to the set up, were a bit far away from you making watching movies not quite as enjoyable, and the quality of the screens was a bit on the lower side.    They did have full AC charging, but no in flight wi-fi on my service.   Overall it was a great experience relative to flying coach, but compared to flying other business class airlines it wasn't special.   

I would probably choose a different airline if you get the same price point.   When I took Air India, it was about $5000 cheaper than the only other option I could book (given my works restriction on airlines), and it was definitely worth saving the money.  However when booking personally I found some other airlines similarly priced which were a bit nicer.

Staff was extremely friendly and attentive, I thought the food was okay (better than coach food, but not as good as other business class food I have had)."

They didn't give me right information about what I need the paper from the MBC of Nepal.
They send me many different places which was wrong. 
They didn't help me for anything finally,I miss my flight.

Got there 2.5 hrs early and almost missed the flight. Line not managed well, had to go to another counter to pay for extra baggage and the cashier did not show up for 20 minutes.

We were booked to travel on Air India's new Dreamliner aircraft and had booked three seats on both the outward and return journey from Singapore to Chennai instead what we got was their much smaller A320 aircraft. Furthermore and much to our annoyance we discovered that on our return journey we had not been allocated three seats together. When we phoned Air India about this their advise was that in order to travel together we would now have to pay an extra fee. In view of this we felt we were being cheated by Air India who we believe were actually in breach of contract given we had already reserved and been allocated seats for the return journey."

First journey to Mumbai saw two meals and free drink soft and alcoholic and free water too . Good space in the seat although a little tired looking upholstery but we have highlighted that .

I would have taken at least 10 flights with them in last couple of years and except once, the flight was never delayed. The food is from Taj and is superb. I specially love the emergency row seats as they have much better legroom than any other Airline. For in flight entertainment they have screens for each passenger but for most of the time, it's not working properly. The flight is generally empty due to the perception of the Airline and because of the routes that it travels to, due to this there is less crowd and you seem to enjoy it."

We had to go for a medical conference from our small town to New Delhi in August 2018. Train journeys are becoming difficult because of his incontinence. So we were happy there is a small airport near us(It's called Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport. I have mentioned Kolkata in  my review because there is no option of small airports in TripAdvisor)It would take less than 2 hours to reach Delhi. However upon reaching the airport we came to know that neither the airport nor Air India had arrangements for a boarding ramp. My son is extremely scared of being transported at great heights on his wheelchair. It's not only dangerous for him but also for the airline attendants who carry such heavy persons on a wheelchair up the flight of stairs of the boarding stairs. So he opted instead to be carried in his father's arms which was equally dangerous for him and his father. The stairs were steep and many in number and by the time his father reached the top, he was breathing heavy and exhausted. Now his father is able to carry him, what will happen when he grows old and can no more carry him? I appeal to #AirIndia and #AviationMinistryIndia to look into it and kindly provide boarding ramps in all airports of India. Thankyou
If this matter is solved, Air India can be worthy of 5 stars as all other services were good."

Every single flight was delayed, air India have to be the most unreliable airline I’ve ever travelled on. We were delayed over 4 hours leaving the uk, delayed over 2 hours travelling from Delhi to Bangalore and delayed over 4 hours back from Bangalore to Delhi, they actually held the plane in Delhi for us and we were rushed by escort through Delhi airport to make the connection, holding up the Delhi flight, and air India told the passengers on that flight they were delayed because of a problem In Heathrow, which wasn’t the case, it was because our connecting flight was delayed. It made for very stressful homeward bound journey. 
The only saving grace was air India staff, that are fantastic! Though don’t bother upgrading to buisness class, it’s pretty shabby and definitely not worth the premium payment, I would just go for extra leg room in economy and save yourself over £600 pound."

It was handled well, explanations given to all and instructions to the parents. All very impressive. My friend had her flight delayed- Air India texted her previous day, called her to give automated message about flight delay on morning of flight and then somebody called her few hours before!

In spite of the terrible reviews people give, Air India's flight 701 on that day was on time and sufficiently pleasant. Great food was served, there were in flight screens even on the 2 hour long domestic route, and legroom was fantastic. I did not like the continuous instructions being played on the PA system on how to operate the toilets and window dimming buttons on the Dream Liner aircraft. That seemed unnecessary. Otherwise, the flight took off and landed on time, and the crew served me pretty well.

Air India cancelled the flight without any prior intimation. The reason stated was baseless quoting the fog and climate conditions at shirdi airport which was completely false as the other airlines were operating same time. I experienced least compassion and courtesy towards the passengers by the AirIndia staffs and there was no alternate arrangements too at the aiport lounge by the airlines. My advice to fellow passengers is please never ever trust AirIndia to book flights to Shirdi. Spice Jet and Indigo are little better in keeping up the commitment."

2. Domestic Aircraft - Instead of the normal Boeing 737-800, they swapped it for the tiny Airbus A320 Neo.

"2018-12-12T02:19:43-05:00","1","review","0","Extremely Disappointing","Due to late visa confirmation booking for another airline, Air India was the most economic option after having lost that ticket.  Upon checking in, I quickly learned the weight restrictions were almost impossible and not fairly implemented.  I took photos of bags that were larger in size than my carryon, yet those made it on board. I even had to through away my yoga mat in order to make the weight.
The boarding process was well don, but as I boarded the plane my heart sunk in utter disbelief.  The aircraft has not been kept or cleaned well.  After all, the plane overnighted in Newark and I wondered why my tray table had coffee stains, etc.  What made the experience worst is that the person to my right appeared drunk so much so he staggered out of his seat, almost fell, hit me in the face with his right hand trying to brace himself and then threw up by the bathroom door.🤮. The person to my left same row seemed to have had dimentia or Alzheimers bc he kept trying to touch me but the lady traveling with him was monitoring him, but it took a turn...
The food was good, but for those who don’t like spicy foods, this will not work at all.
The seats are horrific and the interior is again not kept well.  The TV monitors did not work for me.
The highlight though was to my right, one row back from me.  This 2 year old boy wailed the entire flight where he would calm down for a few moments, followed by more stretching screens.  His mother tried so many methods to calm him, but she too occasionally would holler and strated hitting him out of frustration.  By the way, he kept on hollering just as loud.
This was a 14 hour flight in economy.  I recommend if you are not flying premium or first class on Air India for this particular flight, expect the aircraft to be untidy, not the cleanest, and uncomfortable and a subpar representation of the culture, people and country of India.  It just does not add up and I’d rate it one because I made it from Newark to Mumbai without needing to be admitted.
Seeking another return flight one way back on another airline, hopefully the one I have a credit for.  I just can’t do that again and okaybwoth forging the remaining value on the ticket.
By the way my flight from Mumbai to Hyderabad is delayed an hour.  It has to get better and it will."

Since they have started flying non-stop to Delhi from Washington Dulles, with excellent time slots (1030 AM from IAD reaching Delhi at 2PM and return at 130AM reaching IAD at 630AM), for a decent price, I thought I should give it a try. Non-stop and time slots were too good for me not to try. 

I have to say if one is looking for a flat bed and a non-stop flight, it is fine. If you are interested in little more for your money, such as a one or 2 fine alcoholic (wine or liquor) drinks, good food presented well, attentive or prompt service, it is not your airline for business class trips. 

On my way back, after a domestic travel, I reached Delhi airport with enough time to board the plane at 1AM. After providing a soft drink, nuts in plastic packets and two unappealing appetizers, there were no offers of any alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks or food for another 7 hours, only to be woken up in the middle of the sleep for a breakfast!! Yet another shocker was ‘alcoholic drink service’ starting 2 hours (12 hours after take-off) before landing at Dulles (early morning, time for breakfast, I suppose!) and a ‘standard’ lunch following that. Unless one is a hard-core alcoholic, you will not find many who would drink the mediocre alcoholic beverages they were providing before landing in Dulles early morning. 

It looks like those who run this airline have no clue about international business class travelers. Flight attendants on this segment were equally clueless. Surprisingly, I had much better experience with Air India domestic service (in fact much better than most American domestic flights). Air India definitely should seek help from those who have basic knowledge about international business travelers and could benefit from their excellent time slots and non-stop flights from USA."

The aircrafts were both comfortable, with adequate leg space. Since the first leg was short, we were served snack and a drink. On the second leg, snack was more filling and tea/coffee were served, too.
Crew were professional. Luggage was booked through to Kolkata.
Just to compare we flew the same route on our way to Jaipur on Jet Airways. Cramped flights on both segments and in addition, a small propeller aircraft from Delhi to Jaipur. Luggage couldn’t be booked through, and had to be collected at Delhi airport and loaded through to Jaipur.
Will opt for Air India whenever possible!"

We thought the staff were wonderful both on the ground and inflight. At one check in at Goa the agent realized our layover time in Mumbai would not be enough for our luggage to transfer or for us to make the flight. The agent quickly and efficiently put us on a flight with another airline thereby ensuring a smooth transfer back to Air India. We are so thankful to this agent as he saved the day for us.
We were served very tasty meals on each flight and along with excellent service.
However, the support system i.e. Air India app and website are difficult to maneuver, simply don't work and seat selection consistently not honored or changed - even when we paid extra to upgrade seats - that money is lost.

In addition, most flights were late or delayed with one being delayed nearly two hours.

So I would caution anyone on selecting Air India until their website is brought up to the basic standards of any other airline."

It had to be propped  with napkins to lie flat. Worse, the controller in the arm rest for movies et al wasn't working. The flight attendant rebooted it, but it didn't make any difference - not that I wanted to watch any of their movies - most of them I had never heard of, I just wanted the reading light to work. I asked if I could sit in first class just to read (food and beverage services were over) but that got no response.

I flew Emirates business class last year, so I guess I was spoiled, but I wanted to give Air India a chance. I will not fly with them again."

"2018-12-01T03:43:04-05:00","1","review","4","Bed bugs, delays, lost luggage, rude/inattentive crew and personnel","I flew Air India for the first time this November due to their affiliation with the Star Alliance. I typically have great experiences with Star Alliance members and, having been to India before on United flights, expected about the same level of service. I was woefully mistaken and fully regret my decision. Flying with Air India turned my trip into a hectic, stressful, nightmare of a journey from the very outset. 

It started in Dulles (IAD) airport where I checked in. The desk agent confirmed my bag had been scanned for the flight. Shortly thereafter we board the plane, and it is very old and very dirty (Boeing B77W). I don’t mind older planes, as long as they have been maintained, but this one was filthy - crumbs, dirt, and trash everywhere, bathrooms unclean. Everyone boards on time and it looks like we will depart soon. Then about 30 minutes goes by, and the captain comes on to say we are delayed because some people that checked in haven’t boarded and they can’t find them. Which I actually thought was very considerate, as I have missed flights and connections in the past and know how that feels. Cut to an HOUR later, and still no one is showing. At this point they have delayed a transcontinental flight with a hundred or more people by over an hour. 

The rest of the flight was OK, the service was rude and no one answered any of the service calls of the people around me, but I was comfortable enough.

The flight arrives in New Delhi and I go to retrieve my one checked bag for transfer to my domestic flight. Waiting, waiting, waiting. There are 4 others from the same flight waiting with me as well, our bags never show. The bag claim/handling staff takes us aside and it is clear they are thoroughly disorganized. They have no idea where any of our luggage is, and try to tell my my bag is probably still in the US, even though I know it was at least scanned through Air India for my flight from there. They have us all fill out forms, and then proceed to tell us NOT to put the value of our luggage down in Rupees. That struck me as odd so I pressured the staff as to why and no answer. Definitely reminded me of the general corruption that can surround these affairs - it was highly unprofessional. Luckily I had plenty of time to make my domestic flight after filling out all the claim forms, but 3 out of the other 4 people that also lost their bags were not so lucky and missed their connections. Overall, a completely incompetent handling of the situation.

My domestic flight was fine, and I was ready to get my work week started. When I checked in at the hotel, I gave the concierge the info on my lost luggage so they could follow-up with the airline for me. I also gave it to an admin at my office who was kind enough to follow-up as well. “It will be here on the midnight flight” they were told. But no bag the next day. “It will be here on the 6pm flight” they said, but still no bag. Cut to 5 days later, and multiple calls to the airline by multiple people with always the response that my luggage would “be on the next flight”. At this point I’ve lost hope of seeing it again. I depart for the airport after checking at the hotel one last time. 

Side story to all that - the 2nd night in my hotel room (5 star international hotel in Pune in a junior suite) I found a BED BUG. Judging from the reactions of the staff, they were very surprised this happened. They quickly changed my rooms, cleaned all my laundry, and sent roses up as an apology. Now I have no way of proving whether the bed bugs came with me from the plane or were in the room to begin with, but my instincts tell me it was the (again, very dirty) plane...

On checking in for my return flight to the US - one of the agents takes my carry-on and weighs it and tells me it is too heavy to be a carry on and I must check it. Knowing exactly how that went the first time, I adamantly refuse and offer to take weight or of my bag and transfer it to my backpack so it is within the weight limit. The agent then tells me that while I was arguing with him about checking the bag HE ALREADY CHECKED IT and printed the bag tag so I had NO CHOICE but to check the bag. I insisted on picking it up in New Delhi and he told me I would just have to recheck it there. Truly awful customer service. I picked up my bag in New Delhi and I’ll let you guess whether or not I checked it again. 

My domestic flight from Pune to Delhi was again delayed, so I barely made my connection to get back to the states. Thankfully I boarded just in time.

My flight back to the US from Delhi was on United, and it was such a stark difference to the journey out, the contrast was truly astounding. 

Here’s the finale - I get back to the US, switch on my phone, and it’s a message from the hotel. The airline finally delivered my bag. 5 days later. After I had already left the country.

So in summary, this was the worst overall experience I have had with an airline - consistent delays, lost luggage, rudeness - with the added bonus of a (unproven, but probable) bed bug infestation. Not only should Air India be ashamed of their shoddy operations and customer service, but they are a mis-representation of the Star Alliance brand. They really don’t deserve to be a part of that network. If you do end up flying Air India, good luck and I sincerely hope your experience is better than mine. I, for one, will never be flying with them again."

No ground crew to advise .... people just sat and waited there was no one who could help !!!!!  Whilst getting ready to board then everything came to a standstill , as there was some confusion -instead of optimizing the waiting time and checking IDs etc .... the staff stood still as well .

Enough room for me just about. Inflight food was adequate and obviously Indian based. The interior of the aircraft was clean and in a good condition. Staff were efficient and polite. No flight updates from the flight deck which I found strange as Virgin, BA, Tui and Thomas Cook plus EasyJet do give updates. 
But I suppose the seat back flight information would be ok for most. I had a quick transfer deadline in Mumbai for a connection to Goa. On exiting the aircraft in Mumbai all Goa bound passengers were whisked through to their flight very quickly and I made the flight to Goa."

"2018-11-29T08:00:29-05:00","4","review","0","An OK flight but it could have been better","Earlier this month I flew non-stop from Delhi to New York. Check-in lines at Indira Gandhi airport in Delhi were enormous, and people had piles of luggage. Fortunately a fellow passenger suggested that I ask an Air India attendant if there was a counter for senior citizens. There wasn't, but she allowed me to go to the vacant Business class counter, with the result that I was able to check in and clear security in record time. 
     The plane left 15 minutes late, but it didn't matter because it arrived 10 minutes before schedule. It was a full flight, so there was no question of being able to stretch out on two or three seats. I got a bit of sleep sitting in my seat, which gave me plenty of legroom but I wished that the seats were a bit wider and somewhat better padded. What was a bigger problem was that several problems on the television monitor did not load. I wanted to watch the progress of the flight by following it on a map. But, as one of the flight attendants informed me, owing to a glitch that program was not available on at least 200 monitors on the plane. I thought that it was incredible that thought the staff knew about the glitch, it had not been fixed before the plane took off, but said nothing. At least the plane suffered from no more serious mechanical problems. It flew smoothly, maintained its altitude and direction steadily from what I could tell, and made a good landing. 
     Airlines feed you at odd times. Our flight was no exception. I got served meals and snacks a number of times. The food, while not inedible, was perfectly unmemorable. I cannot recall any dish that stood out.
     Mercifully the lavatories remained reasonably clean throughout the flight, though passengers did strew bits and pieces of paper all round. 
     Would I fly Air India again? It seems that when it comes to flying Economy, most airlines are fairly alike. Only two companies fly nonstop between New York and Delhi, Air India and United; and choosing between them is like choosing between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. So, in answer to my question: Why not? But not very happily."

We travelled from Washington Dulles to Delhi(Air India# 104) and then took AI#849 to Pune. We  came back to Washington Dulles from Delhi(Air India#103) with Air India. Except the flight attendants on these two flights and i should say the food that was served on AI#104(outbound from Washington Dulles), everything else was horrible.So, the food served from the flight leaving Delhi(AI#103) was bad.

The seats/interiors were similar in condition to what one would find on a local bus, that many people may have travelled or seen in India. Poor condition sums it up perfectly. 

Keep reading for the worst is saved for the last here :(

While returning from Pune(AI#850) our luggage was checked all the way for Washington Dulles(via Delhi: AI#103). First their computer at Pune airport had some issue and it was not able to read the perfectly fine machine readable passports that were read with ease at almost all other airports, including at Delhi. So, that checkin at Pune took more than an hour and multiple agents!! Poorly qualified workers.

To make things worse, when we arrived at Washington Dulles(Nov 4,2018) by AirIndia(#103); one of our brand new American Tourister baggage was completely torn and damaged. The ground staff initially mentioned that this damage is very common!! So, that was his response when i as a customer complained about my damaged luggage. On further discussion, he mentioned that though he is wearing and Air India badge he is not an Air India employee!! He mentioned that he worked for Delta and that he acknowledged that Air India is poor when it comes to damaged baggage compensations!!
Well, i opened one claim for the damaged bag at the Washington Dulles Airport and that was 4th Nov 2018 and today is 25th Nov 2018; i haven't heard anything after that. This is a cheap reflection on the service standards that exist in India even today especially in the Airline business. Air India should close if it has to operate like this and cheat customers and operate the way it is currently doing.

Travel with this airline at your own risk as i would never use this airline. Nothing, on the ground, seems to have changed with this airline except may be the press and media management."

Now, the customs line. We had about 20 persons in line ahead of us. Took an hour and 40 minutes. Totally unbelievable.

Then came the rediculous re scan of all persons and bags in the terminal by the gate. They actually pulled us out of the waiting area so they could again frisk and x-ray everything.

Then we finally boarded and we're about to take off on the main runway when we were told there was a malfunction and had to return to gate.

That took another two hours.

Totally unsatisfied with Delhi airport and air India.

But was not disappointed, because If you have no expectations in India, you're fine."

I then tried to use the button to call the attendant. That also did not work. 
My next flight I received my luggage back cracked. A hard case suitcase. I didn't even know you could break them! 
I attempted to notify the airline about my damaged luggage. I got the run around. I called the customer service line and they said to take it up with the desk at the airport. I was at the desk for over an hour attempting to have this taken care of only to have them tell me that I need to address it when I arrive back in the states. No attempt what so ever was made to improve my experience. My final flight back the ""next"" button didn't work on my touch screen on the TV so I could only watch the videos on the first screen. The tray was dirty with the previous customers dinner and there was lollipop sticks and candy wrappers in the seat pocket. I think on the 15.5 hour flight they came through offering beverages once... 
Direct, reasonably priced flights compared to other airlines but expect nothing to work and it to be filthy. And don't expect the flight attendants to do anything to improve your experience."

On the flight the plane looked grubby. The air hostess were not at all very friendly. The food was disgusting. I had pre booked a meal on line but they failed to have that on board. Husband entertainment screen wasn't workimg and they had no loads that he could use. On the return journey the staff again at airport were lovely. The air hostesses were exactly the same as going out and the food was disgusting.

"2018-11-19T20:15:51-05:00","2","review","2","Cheap quality and experience","Air India in my opinion will not be around for very long, this airline is failing badly in many ways.

They have somehow managed to make a new 787 Dreamliner look like an old 70s Boeing by using very cheap materials inside. I don’t know they managed it, but they did. Obviously no interior designers here.
I am aware that this airline has big financial problems, although it’s no excuse to make the passenger feel like they are in a second rate plane.

The infotainment system is cheap, even business class had a very small selection and a very small screen (it’s a new plane). Business class food is upstaged by economy class on Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Etihad and Malaysian to name a few and the facilities onboard are dire. 
The only saving grace is that they are part of star alliance, so you can use partners lounges instead. United airlines was very good

This poor service also extends to the ground staff who it seems are more interested in their mobile phones than assisting the paying passengers. This really is terrible.

The only saving grace I would say is the cabin crew, they try their best with very poor equipment and do managed to serve you with a smile.

Sorry if this feels like a rant, although I really wouldn’t be recommending this airline to anyone. If you must fly with an international Indian airline, go with Jet.

Boarding with this airline is usually chaotic but, after two weeks in-country, we were pretty savvy about getting where we want to when we need to. Service was very good, flight attendants were not crazy busy as this was not a full flight. Three meals (both veg and non-veg choices), plus beverage service, free alcohol, extra snacks, juices and water made available in the mid-galley partway through the flight, TV/movie service was fine and the full-sized headsets are way more comfortable than earbuds. Blankets are full-length and that was helpful since, being by the ext door tends to be a pretty cold area of the plane, Announcements were kind of muffled.

"2018-11-17T20:22:34-05:00","3","review","2","Inferior service for business class","Although the plane was a fairly new Dreamliner, the business class seating was poor. The setup would have been ideal- a modest size business class of only 4 rows of 6 ( 2x2x2).
The seats did not function properly- the gentleman next me was required to move before takeoff as seat was broken.

The pre-flight drinks were non-alcoholic. I found out later that the flight was dry because it flew over Saudi airspace (the last time I checked other airlines only suspended service in the airspace- which takes about 1 hour to clear).
The dinner was a mediocre curry with a yogurt in a container like you buy in the supermarket in the States. There was no beverage service offered except water. And obviously no appetizer.  If the food was this substandard in business, I wonder what they tossed out as food for the masses in coach.

Back to the seats. When it came time for sleeping, I learned that the flat bed could not accommodate a six foot person (I am 6’1”). It was damn uncomfortable- I had get in a fetal position to get some zzz’s.  I was not sure whether my seat was short because I was in Row 1, which is the bulkhead. I asked the gentleman behind me who was about my height and told me that he likewise had slept in a ball.

The entertainment system was difficult to extract from its stowage between the seats. It was much more difficult to put back without getting out of your seat to monkey it back in.

The attendants were professional but not particularly friendly. I am not sure if it was cultural.  My biggest complaint- which I hesitate to mention- is that they made a racket for about an hour after dinner service when I was trying to sleep. A lot of cabinet door slamming and moving of shelves. It sounded like a kitchen. It may have been just a lousy design for the plane buildout as I did not see sound damping walls like in other Dreamliners.  

On the subject of Dreamliners, this particular craft looked a lot older and more used. In fact, if I did not recognize the large windows, i would have thought it was a 767.

There were some nice things. An offering of PJs with the Air India mascot on it. Socks. And a nice toiletries bag.

JAI - DEL October 13

I do have to say my expectations were not very high  for this airline but what occurred was that since the airplane was a bit old, I noticed you had a bit more space, the flight attendants were much more friendlier and in general the service was more client based. The food was pretty terrible but the flights were all under 4 hours so just the fact that we got something on the plane was already great. 

Either way I do recommend that you fly this airline if you have the opportunity to take them throughout India, of course there are better boutique airlines out there but Air India does the job and if you are lucky enough to get one of their 787 then you are in for a treat. 

They are also the cheaper option in India. DO IT !!!!"

The stench had become unbearable. The flight attendants alerted the aircrew and a wise decision was taken to land back at Delhi and change flight. When the decision was announced , there was a cheer among the passessengers and brought a clap from all when the aircraft landed back at Delhi.

worked double time and produced a new aircraft as a replacement for the flight. Was relieved to board a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner

This time I had it, staff is rude even to business class folks.  Flew economy a few times years ago. It used to better than what business is today, except the seats.  The attitude of the staff has noticeably changed towards the worse.  There is no excuse for a behavior when the stewardess gives a passenger a “rude awakening” by fast-tilting his seat forward to the point that he slams his head on the seat in front of him, just to force feed him his meal which he may be least interested in.  On board staff seems “angry” all the time.  

This new paid seat assignment is a nightmare. Air India’s frequent flyer program is difficult to navigate, I have given up on their KYC process.  It is worse than applying for an OCI card.  Ended up losing thousands of miles.  

Business class is regularly filled with Indian government Babus, VIPs, AI staff, freeloaders.  They handed out sleepwear to passengers, I asked for one later because none was given to me, and the reply was “we don’t have any”.  Before take off, 3 different people asked us for our boarding passes when we were already in our seats, I asked why... no reason was given.  Paid passengers are given this treatment.  

I am going to skip this one next time. This may be a good airline for old age parents and moms flying with kids.  "

 Cheap flight cheap service!","I flew with air India last October on a 8hrs flight Rome- New Delhi. The ticket was approximately £247 one way. And I am happy that I just did one way with air India.

Definetly a very un satisfying service. The plane is small. Old. But hey, you can’t expect ethiad airlines standards or KLM or Emirates for that amount of money. The size is not the biggest problem . It’s just a bit uncomfortable, but that’s all.

The problem is the crew and the level of hygiene.

The Stuart’s and hostess were highly unprofessional. We were flight at 8.45pm going towards India so for the majority it was a night flight. Now you understand some people might want to sleep, some want to eat, some want to drink. You cannot bother people waking them up shaking them from the harm if they are sleeping. I have never seen anything like that. In my previous flight to India with British airways and other trips around the world I have never been woken up or seen anyone being disturbed at 12am just for dinner. They leave it there and that’s it. What dinner then? A bunch of cold old stuff sealed in a horrendously presented plastic tin? Really bad. The crew are loud and do not take care of their customers. Really really bothering.

And that’s not all. The toilets were disgusting . Unacceptable and inaccessible. Dirty, filthy. Where is the maintenance? You need to keep it clean with that amount of people using 4 toilets for 8 hours.

Definetly I didn’t have such high  expectations because the flight was cheap considering I bought it just 1month before, but I would have liked some decency. I regret not taking pictures.

It doesn’t deserve to be the Indian flag airline. Next time I’d rather pay £50/100 more than flying with them again."

The staff members simply don't know what customer service is about.

They tried asking him for how much money I have and indicated I may need to pay somethings to get the information updated on my ticket. They seem to not know how to treat someone with basic human dignity.

My only 'fault' (if you want to call it that) was not to have checked in online and the connection flight in the UK was with BA. The shear lack of ignorance of Air India staff members was astonishing as they were unable to comprehend how he was able to get travel ticket from Delhi to Manchester with Air-India (Delhi to London) and then BA (London to Manchester) on same ticket. In spite of being their to help customers, their attitude was horrendous and not friendly but more having a chip on their shoulder either due to jealously or personal problems. 

On the plane their media system did not work- which I have read from other reviews is not uncommon. Food as always was bland but that is relatively typical for any flight.

Bad points: food looked awful and tasted very mediocre, some flight attendants looked disgruntled and looked like they didn't get the memo on customer service (it always seemed to be the older more senior ones) and were impolite and unhelpful, headphones were so bad they were unusable so make sure you bring your own, express lane passes handed out when deplaning we were told later in immigration were useless and we just stood in line with everyone else.
I certainly would not turn down the offer of Business Class again if offered but would try and get onto a different airline if I could. Not sure on cost as my company paid.   "

My flight take off time was 8:50 pm and I reached the airport check-in desk at 8:09 pm. The check-in lady wasted some time but after some urging, she was willing to allow me to check-in but her supervisor standing behind her said no need to entertain me and did not allow me to check in. It was an urgent trip for me as I had to report to job the very next morning and he said:- ""if your trip was urgent you would have come earlier"". If I am spending 7000 rupees the least I can expect is to be allowed to check in if the aircraft is parked in the airport with another 40 mins of time before takeoff. It takes atleast 15 min for the process of boarding to be completed and I was just 2 - 3 mins late to the counter closing.
Not only am I highly disappointed at this but also extremely angry due to this blatant looting of money in the form of denial of service when there is 43 mins to time to taking-off. 
I will never choose to use the service of Air-India in future and make sure that my fellow friends and family and colleagues who are frequent flier never avail this sham of airlines until the need is dire.
Please opt for other airlines and do not avail Air-India's service unitl the need is dire"

Right from the check-in to the boarding to off boarding and collecting the baggage everything was so damn messed up. Stroller was packed and checked in to a different flight. They don't even try to help if you are with kids. Seems like some travellers found bed bugs in the flight. They also damaged our double stroller and never paid the claims. Stay away and book the tickets in a slightly more expensive middle eastern flight, and you will be better off with a happy travel experience than paying less but for way too low standards for this flight. There is nothing praiseworthy or even up to the International standards with Air India. Not a surprise that they are selling the airlines.

Our flight, AI446 IXL-DEL, had been canceled on Oct 19, 2018 due to technical issue. We had arrived airport c. 9.45 until the 11.55, flying time, delay was announced. Given waiting for another 2-3 hr., eventually, flight cancellation was announced, thanks Air India (AI) to concern passenger safety first, but the whole terrible story just started!

Poor1 – no official announcement
After the official announcement of flight cancellation, we have to take care ourselves, no official recommendation from AI what to do next or contact any counter. Almost passengers (est.100-120) ran into staffs ask only their cases, and then foreign travelers got the last serve as we can’t compete with Indian people.

Poor2 – cannot handle with Indian people
When we are on the queue to book the hotel, Indian people don’t know how to “stay in the line” or “wait on the queue”, even we try to speak with them, no proper manner in return. They still stretch their arms with boarding pass over our heads and shoulder to get serve, fortunately, AI staffs even can’t solve the situation, they do first come first serve. I don’t want to summarize that almost Indian people be like this since there are some Indian guys give us their hands to help. However, when you were on the line in India, you have to protect your rights. 

Poor3 – deficient transfer bus to hotel
This is not the 1st time AI encounter the cancel flight (as I asked them), but the arrangement was suck! Staffs cannot do it orderly, not enough bus for the passengers, even we waited for an hour to take the 3rd bus. At first, staffs try to push our group (10 people with 10 luggage) in the 2nd bus with limited space, even see by any eyes you can understand that it is not enough for the remaining of 20 people left with their belongings. Don’t know what staffs thinking and decide to do like that.

Poor4 – cheap inn represent your AI cheap brand
Staffs provided overnight stay with 1-star inn (or even less than), room has equipped with bathroom, bed, blanket, rug but all are dirty and not warm enough. At first, we did not accept this inn but bus had already gone (bring others to see other inns). We try to negotiate how much AI can pay, we will pay extra & find HOTEL ourselves. Staffs insisted if we find ourselves, AI is not responsible for any hotel & transportation costs. We try to contact our hotel to ask for available rooms but there is out of service area. We seem to have no choice as time around 18.00, sky getting dark outside. Staffs bluffed us that other inns not have hot water which was not true since we asked others when we met. Moreover, this inn was full of gas smell in all dinning & living rooms when they prepare dinner & breakfast.

Poor5 – dumb again on transfer bus to airport
AI sent free (medium size) bus to pick up passengers that stayed with our group last night, c. 20 people include 10 of us. After we carried our 10 luggage into the bus (1st time by ourselves), staffs said we have to move to another bus which, again, not have enough space for our groups. Staffs insisted & turn off the engine, so we carried down our luggage (2nd time with little help of staffs). We quarrel with staffs as they rush us to get into the bus by leave our luggage. I ask them since they have that free bus why we have to press into space that not enough. They said free bus will pick up other passengers (which is not true, they lie us again, no other passengers on this way). Eventually, we got the same bus by this time staffs carried our luggage since we had used up all our energy amongst thin air of Leh.

Poor6 – no preparation of cert. of cancellation
There was no preparation of cert. of cancellation in advance, as almost of over 100 passengers need this document. We had to wait the printing, stamping, and signing by AI Leh manager which not take it serious even we have less than 10 minute for boarding time. Hurrrrr

This is really damn management, your reputation is gone with this poor decision. We don’t want to solicit anything, just share our bad experience and hope you can improve your services. Given the Indian national airline and your slogan of Truly Indian, Air India is not only carry your own reputation, but also the pride of India."

So my flights took off on time (both ways) and in fact reached SIN earlier than the actual time. check in was easy. Service at the check in counter was ok. whereas the crew's attitude seems to be so 'not bothered' and just want to get the work done kind of attitude. Maybe AI should replace the senior crew with his bad attitude with younger dynamic crew like Indigo. 
Why hasn't AI's service has not improved all these years i wonder?
Food was average. I would say that the cabin was not very clean. But i told myself, for the price i paid i should not be complaining much. But it's a shame that India's national airline offers this kind of service.
Cabin entertainment was below average.Not much of selections.

After boarding was completed, the plane was quite empty. The economy seating is really outdated and very dirty, you could see all the dirt in the tiny gaps in the personal screen area.

The economy seats were good and spacious, food was good. Good connection to Indian cities and I can do customs at the destination city. 

For the trip on first class, there were people waiting with my name at Delhi airport (as I was connecting from another city).  They carried the luggage and we could not go to the lounge as we need to go through immigration and the flight was not on their computers yet (as I had more than 7 hours for flight departure). We waited in the lobby and went inside around 4.5 hours before departure. There were 2 people escorting us (and dragging our luggage) and went through the Delhi immigration using the first/business counter. Spent the time in first class lounge - had some time to sleep. 

The seat was pretty good and wide and the amenities and food were good. The staff made the bed. The only thing complaint I have are - could not use the power ports to charge my ipad or iphone - not working properly - had same issues on several United flights as well. Movie choices are very limited. 

The luggage came out pretty fast - was available after immigration.

At Goa airport I requested my bag be checked direct to Ho Chi Minh. The staff told me they would do it only upto Singapore. No explanation was offered. At Changi Airport, to my horror, I found myself in Immigration which I had to cross to get to baggage claim.  Neither my travel agent nor the Air India staff had advised me that I would need a Singapore transit visa to collect my bag and connect to JetStar.  The officials flicking through my passport found a valid US visa and gave me a one time pass to collect my bag and connect to JetStar. I was firmly told that on my return, I would have to possess a transit visa. I am a senior citizen and I was travelling alone. It was traumatic 
On my first night in HCMC, I was surfing the net to find out why this was so. I came across Air India’s policy for Singapore and learned that it is mandatory for passengers to hold a visa for Singapore if they have an onward connecting flight operated through low cost carriers like Scoot, Tiger Airways, Air Asia, JetStar Asia etc.
Inter line facility is provided by Air India for passengers travelling on full service carriers like Singapore Airlines, Qantas etc. where they can check in and connect to these airlines without holding a Singapore visa."

The transit was reduced from 2 hours 10 minutes to one hour 10 minutes. Flying usually via Dubai or Doha, they advise 45 minutes minimum transit time. Air india website said 1 hour but I thought i'd ring and check. 
First call, 18 minutes on hold, no answer. 
Second call. explained why I'm calling, is 1 hour 10 mins enough for transit. Answer , no, and he hung up.
So I've been changed to a flight the airline knows can not be met.
Third call, demand a manager. Seems one hour 10 mins is too little. Offered a 9 hour layover in Delhi followed by a flight via Chennai with a 5 hour layover arriving 16 hours later than my original planned arrival in colombo. I obviously refuse that. 
What next? I tell them Ive looked, refund my flight or change it to one day earlier where for some reason the connection time is 2 hours 10 minutes. Finally they agree to this and fortunately one extra day in Sri Lanka does not cause me any issues. But frankly they are hopeless and you have to be very alert and offer your own solutions."

- One wonders if the flight attendents have never learned to smile, or whether they were taught not to. They go by once with food, then clean, then coffee. They never check if everything is OK.
- Worst of all they darken the windows (no manual shades), turning day into night. It is absolutely oppressing to see the sun look like the moon in a black sky in the middle of the day. It reminds me of how we treat our pet birds: when we want them to sleep, we put a cover on the cage, and take it off at wake up time. Here it seems they wanted everyone to go to sleep so they would have no work to do once the food had been handed out (I will not say ""served""), and garbage collected. Then they turn on full lights (still not lightening the windows, as if they are waking us up when it is time for breakfast - at 5pm Paris time, before arrival.
This lighting is very disconcerting. I feel like an animal in a laboratory taking part in studies concerning light. The controlled lighting  is a sufficient reason in and of itself to disprefer Air India."

As we had also booked internal flights to Kerala, it left us having to rebook for 24 hours earlier, and paying for an additional night in Delhi. There was no apology, or offer of recompense. We had 4 flights in total over the 2 weeks. 
The planes were filthy, certainly not been cleaned in months. Everything was sticky, and smelt bad. 
The food was just awful, I am a fan of Indian dishes, but these didn't even attempt to be either appetising or tasty. Honestly didn't know what I was eating.
There was only one crew member that was pleasant, and helpful. The others made a point of not being happy or helpful. I only asked for hot water to make a decaffeinated coffee (none offered on the flight) I did get the water but was refused a spoon! The seats are the most uncomfortable I have ever sat on, within 1hour of flying I was wriggling and had 8.5 more hours to go! 
The entertainment was poor. 
I entered the plane home healthy, having taken care throughout my visit to Delhi/Kerala/and Agra, but within hours of returning I was terribly ill, and required medication to recover. I am in no doubt where this illness was contracted, as I say everything was so dirty.  I could not say strongly enough, Do Not Fly With This Airline. There is zero respect for their customers.

We wanted to overnight at Hyderabad after coming from Varanasi by INDIGO(nice service) and stayed at Taj Banjara overnight and visited relatives next day morning and went to airport at 12;20 pm to catch 2:40 pm flight to shirdi.

Our troubles started with check in itself. The check in staff harassed us that out hand luggage would not fit in the top and hence wanted us throw away things over 15 kgs
(later i saw that it fitted perfectly alright). Looking for money from travellers like us.

Next we were made to sit in flght for 2 hours and then were informed that flighs are cancelled for the day and then collect our luggage and then to to the booking office.

 Booking office was on the 3rd floor and we are the last people to go there after collecting our luggage and finding our way after requesting many staff

We were told that we will get refund or next available flight subject to availability of seats. No assurance and the booking staff is 2-3 peolple only. They took atleadt 30 minutes per passenger to issue refund or reissue.For every transaction they were phoning duty manager to get his approval.

Finally when our turn came at 8: 30 PM they are not able to accommodate for the next day as there were no seats.
They offerred no option. Luckily some others were enquiring hyderabad-mumbai-shirdi flight option. We were told that the transit time is only 15 minutes and the system would not allow. After begging and banging the door and angry shouting from fellow passengers, they issued tickets for 2 of us after initially telling us that there are no seats 
Surprisingly , the transit time as per the ticket is 1 hour 15 minutes(actulaay it was more than 2;:30 minutesfor us. Hyderabad to Mumbai flight  was empty with about 20 passengers for 200 person flight and likewise Mumbai-Shirdi flight also was half empty.

We lost our precious time on that afternoon for waiting to rebook instead

Most unfreindly ground and booking staff. We are senior citizens and kept waiting to sort out our issues without empathy and had show our passports and oci cards to show that we are outstation travellers. 

My main complaint is that why they lied about seat availability and flight timings. It would be a simple case to provide alternate booking if possible instead of haggling and harassing. We were just few 15-20 passengers who rebooked and it should take 2-3 hours to rebook in empty flights?

All in all this was my 2nd Air India trip after all and both had been disasters.

To substantiate: my trip date is 25th September 2018 Hyderabad - Shirdi air india flight

One more tricks by air india.They allot seats all in back rows and keep all front seats vacant so their service will be easy. For our HYD-MUM flight only last 6-7 rows are fully seated and rest are all empty  - See attached photo"

On repeated occasions, my entertainment system (tv, earphone) has not worked throughout the journey.

The FC cabin was empty (I was the only passenger in FC) and the area looked typical Indian govt. office reception.
However the crew was overtly cordial (maybe because of FC- but later whenever I traveled FC on this Airline found them to be the same). They pilot announced that alcoholic beverages would be provided only after we were out of Saudi airspace - but the drinks were served to me only 5 mins after take-off - GOOD!
They the choice of food was memorable as I was dying for Indian food and the card had many options - and I settled for good old biryani. The food was served in proper manner with proper cutlery and clean sheets to cover the eating area. Food was good - and on enquiring was told it was prepared by Taj Group - so anyways it had to be good(that is what happens if you get to a particular standard with a service provider).
Overall a comfortable journey. The crew was vry helpful all the way."

They allow you 25 kgs per passenger unlike 15 kg by Indigo.The flight was on time. The air hostesses were young(unlike earlier times) and dressed smartly. The seats are wider than normal though the upholstery could do with replacement. Air India is one of the few domestic airlines in India which serve snacks in the flight. The sandwich was decent.

The flight was pleasant and the food better than most airlines, but the supervision was somewhat casual. Going out no one checked seatbelts and coming back passengers were using mobile phones during take off and landing and were not challenged. Hand luggage rules were also breached as to size and number. This is just an observation. Boarding going out was leisurely and efficient and both flights arrived early. The staff were pleasant especially on the outward journey. I enjoyed the experience and would use them again but they do need to keep passengers under tighter control in current times."

This time I found the cabin crew especiall the male business class FA  very rude.  The rest of the staff was very uninviting  to say the least.

This actually had changed back in June and we found out coincidentally but Air India thought its ok to inform passengers just 4 days before (we can have no plans of our own, we are at the mercy of Air India).

Appalling service. The journey from Birmingham to Kolkata, screens didnt work and the cabin crew were so rushed that professionalism was out of the window.

On way back from Kolkata, we were not informed that the flight was domestic until Delhi, we left our home Kalyani at 2am to be there for International departure with 2 little ones half asleep. While checking in online our seats were changed!!! We were informed that the journey from domestic to international is very short and immigration would not take long but this is Delhi airport where there is no organisation!

The walk was long, the time was short and there was no help or assistance! The queue for immigration was so long and not a single staff was helpful. After speaking to 4 unhelpful people I had to put my foot down and get through via special assistance. No priority no management for people with infants. The left arm doesn't know what the right is doing, everyone busy shrugging responsibility. 

On the flight, the faces and attitude the cabin crew had made me wonder if they are doing us a favour by serving. Is that a tack so people don't as for assistance? The screens and head phones barely work. The wait at Amristar was horrible and the snack served was pathetic. Although we requested child meal we were not offered and staff had no understanding of what I was explaining. 

I chose Air India over Emirates due to the long wait in Dubai, its better to wait in Dubai then have such awful journey with yourselves! 

Have given it a 4 for the few staff members that were a tad bit professional and the fact that we travelled safely to our destination."

Even though the aircraft was on bay for over one hour, the lavatories had not been cleaned.  Instead, copious spraying of room fresheners was done to allay the foul smell but to no avail.  the economy section of the aircraft retained its designer ""desh ki khusboo"".

The cabin crew were grossly under-trained.  The essential cabin announcements, as mandated by regulations, were done in a lamentable manner, by novice cabin attendants.  Although the cabin crew supervisor was on hand, no attempt was made to correct or intervene. Appeared as if was the airline training their crew 'on-the-job'. 

 I WONDER IF DGCA INSPECTS THEIR OPERATIONS?

The in-flight menu was a poor excuse for a meal.  Thimble sized plastic cups for serving hot beverages and snacks that resemble 'road-kill'.  Photos are attached for reference.

To my nightmare as I landed after my domestic flight at Delhi, I found out that Air India had lost my luggage. I was going to the UK for about a year as a student and had some important stuff in the bag too and you may understand how stressful it could be to lose that bag. I had to also check-into my international flight about 12 hours later so I was really worried. When I asked the Air India people they simply said that they do not know where my luggage has gone. After requesting them several times at regular intervals they became rude and just started to make excuses. Even 6 hours after I had lost my bag they were not able to trace where has it gone, or in which part of the country was it in. With all the modern tracking and tagging and barcoding technologies on the luggage, still, they just could not tell where my bag was. They used to say that the there office at the other cities airport where they suspect my baggage could have gone is not picking up the phone. It is really the height of excuses and unprofessionalism. You can think how irresponsible of them it was to say that their own office in the other city is not picking the phone when called from the other office in New Delhi. And if it's true it's more alarming since if the offices do not pick up the official calls will they be picking any call from any customer itself? There were very big negligence and irresponsibility on the part of the airlines and the way they were dealing with the customers.

In the international flight, the remote of the in-flight entertainment system was broken. The seats were good, the food was decent. However, unlike in the few other airlines, they provide 2 full meal and 1 snack meal. The flight overall was comfortable but the luggage fiasco would still carry a big blemish for this airlines for me and I still would not recommend you travelling through this airline after I have had this horrific customer experience."

Felt all the services right from gate check in, boarding, in flight snack/meal, service to saying good bye were great. Especially the landing, it was very smooth and no turbulence felt. I even saw some elderly passengers thanking personally the Captain for the landing.

Only point I felt need some improvement is overall cleanliness. I could find some seats and some corners of the built got stains which if the flight attendants could check regularly they could be at the par."

I have to say, it was certainly one of the most comfortable flights I've experienced (in economy).

Good leg room (and I have long legs so I would know). Decent food (I was never left hungry because enough meals/snacks were served throughout the flight). Smooth flight/smooth landing. Decent choice of Entertainment (I say 'decent' because I'm a person who enjoys English entertainment only, but for someone who enjoys both - I guess it's better than decent). 

Minor delay but I guess that's something that just happens and it can happen to any airline/flight.
However, they do make up for the delays (if any) in travel time.

Another really good point to be noted is - If the flight has been boarded by all the passengers, they do not waste time even if it before schedule. The flights departs as soon as possible. That's awesome."

"2018-09-18T06:57:15-04:00","4","review","3","Not bad at all !!","I recently flew Air India from Copenhagen to Delhi and what an experience !!
Pros : why I will fly again :)
- its a direct flight YEAA !! Finally we have a direct flight from Copenhagen to Delhi with a total flight time of 7 hours. For sure it beats flying 14 hours including transit time with other airlines. AI also has direct flights from Stockholm to Delhi.
- if you book well in advance like 6/7 months ahead, the price is quite competitive and comparable to the other airlines. But be prepared to pay thru your nose if you book a month before the flight. I booked in advance and paid around 460 euros one way.
- Dreamliner comfort - new planes with comfortable seat rows and good legroom.
- Baggage - You get 41 Kgs weight allowance per person in economy. This is amazing, something that other airlines just dont offer. Keep it up Air India.
- I understand that Air India has some of the most competent and experienced pilots in the industry and it could be so because the takeoff and landing was smooth and effortless for the passenger both ways (I flew back AI as well). Very reassuring !!

Cons : potential for improvements.
- Food & service - not the best and can be improved if AI makes an effort. Airline food is tolerable in most airlines anyway except maybe Emirates. But what AI really needs to work on is the service offer. India is known for its hospitality and I am sure the ambassodors in the sky can do better. This is of course a general comment because one of them really went out of her way to make you comfortable with a smile. Maybe the others were just simply bored !! 
- inflight entertainment is a joke. Old movies with limited choice, poor display and heavy touch screen controls makes a deadly combination. You need your own Ipad or music to keep entertained.

So two potential for improvement and so many good things going for them. Not bad at all considering that these issues can be fixed if someone makes an effort."

The outbound was so strange. In the middle of the seat, there was a cover that was just falling off. When off, we could see into the airplane. We gave up in the end and just had full access to the insides of the plane. 

My wife's TV didn't work, at all, and we barely got an apology. Fine, it's a night flight anyway. 

We didn't get a single smile from our stewardess. Not a single one. She wasn't rude, per se, but she definitely wasn't concerned about us feeling welcome. 

When it came time for dinner, it was a 'chicken or meat' choice. Literally, like that. ""Do you want chicken curry or meat?"" OK, we'll both have the chicken. 

She comes back after a while and says, ""I've got a suggestion. Why don't one of you have the meat?"" Er, no thanks, ordered the chicken. Turns out, they'd run out of chicken. So then she offers to go to economy and get one of their chicken dishes. We say we'll just take one chicken and a vegetarian something if they have it. They did. 

The flight was smooth, the seats were comfy and we were on time. No complaints. 

However! The flight back was the exact opposite.

Everything worked, the steward was friendly and happy, we had a full menu, including port and cheese, there was no hole down between our seats, and basically we got what you'd expect to get in business. 

I have no idea what went wrong with the outbound. 

Am - oddly - giving them another chance in February 2019. Only time will tell."

I was travelling with someone not well and the airport and airline crew helped throughout the journey but it took a me forever to book the free service while I reached airport and over the phone the day before my journey. The user interface is poor for AI.

The particular flight started very much in time from Mumbai. The seat was comfortable for 6 feet 1 inch tall person like me. They served dinner in the flight that includes pretty much sufficient food with tea / coffee. The food quality was best among all Indian carriers. The boarding and de-boarding process was smooth.

Madrid Delhi. Dreamliner. Paid seats. 
The remote controls of both seats were dead, despite repeated software resets by crew it was useless. 
The embarrassed crew requested me to fill the feedback form which I did. 

On arrival I complained to Air India Mumbai and the duty officer requested me to make a complaint to Mrs. Tripti Majumdar. 
Her email was simply a reply of denial, she even had the audacity to mention that the policy of Airindia is not to refund for paid seats. 
To add insult to injury the flight from Madrid was delayed and thereby connecting flight to Mumbai was, and the journey back was 34 hours. 
Air India service on flight is at par with the best, sadly the ground staff have ruined this beautiful airline created by a master JRD Tata.

Aircraft’s were clean seats comfortable leg space good I hope I could say the same about the snacks they serve which were not nice .

The smile on the face of crew which one is so used to seeing in other airlines was missing  the air  host looked like clerks from a government office . Rather on deplaning at delhi the pilot was standing on the door of the cockpit giving dirty look as if the passengers are responsible for the delay in salaries or non payment of flying allowance. 

Still overall the experience was very efficient oops I said it to soon the luggage  announced to arrive on belt no 2 arrived at belt no 5.

Instead they put it directly under the seat, making for much, much more leg room. I recently flew with Qatar's Dreamliner and the leg room there is horrible.
IFE was decent, not the best I've seen but not bad either. Food was good, and they offer free drinks including spirits. Cabin crew was polite and offered water and snacks on several occasions. The only negative on my journey was the long stop in Delhi, but I knew that before flying and it was a choice I made. All in all, for what I paid, Air India offered great value.

The aircraft is beautiful and spacious.  The cabin was well maintained and clean. Seat very comfortable and spacious.  
Although Air India still has old ladies who  should be looking after their grandchildren working as stewardesses, they have younger staff also. Luckily for us, our seating was being looked after two young energetic guys who were always around, politely serving the passengers and taking care of requests. I will give them a five star rating for their service. 
Take off and landing was smooth and overall a very content journey.  When the tickets were booked, the family was sceptical to travel Air India as we normally fly Emirates, however they were also satisfied.

Most Important is to counter-check the seat #s. We reserved 3 seats together but on our flight back from DEL we all were in separate seats. In India they mentioned, it's soft reservation online while buying tickets and we were supposed to reserve it again 48 hrs before flight!!! It took us 1 hr to get the seats together with our toddler kid.

Experience from IAD to DEL: Only drawback was the service. No one came to collect trash except after the meals were served. No snacks or drinks in between.

Experience from DEL to IAD: Staff was amazing. Came to came to collect trash multiple times. Had a section at the back with Veg sandwitches, cookies and a drink cart for self service. The crew would make tea/coffee on request, paying special attention for the amount of milk and sugar. 

Same plane goes back and forth. Many of the monitors or head phones were NOT working  (Please have a backup plan for kids). Washrooms were OK but ran out of toilet paper towards the tail end of flight(carry a back-up), senior passengers took long and may knock on washroom doors if they are waiting :-)

You can't beat the fact that it's a direct flight. No more issues of loosing your luggage, waiting in other airports and best for parents with a multilingual staff (Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali etc)."

I usually try to avoid Air India because of some previous bad experiences. I was returning from Istanbul to Bangalore (Bengaluru), and Turkish Airlines issued a ticket which gave me a routing of Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Mumbai and Air India connecting flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru. The flight from Istanbul to Mumbai was on time and uneventful. At Mumbai, at around 5.15 am, the Air India staff gave me a boarding pass for the AI 639 flight to Bengaluru scheduled at 9.20 am. As I crossed the security gate, I saw the TV screens showing the flight time delayed to 12.10 pm (about 3 hours). It seems the staff at the checkin counter knew about it but still issued me the boarding pass to this flight. Meanwhile, another earlier Air India flight was leaving at 6.15 am to Bengaluru with empty seats. The staff had made no attempt to try to accommodate passengers like me who were in time for it but were scheduled on the later flight. I went to the staff to ask about options. They were so callous about it. I was asked to contact Turkish Airlines, and then the staff of the 2 airlines got engaged into a ballgem passing me back and forth between the two. I walked back and forth between counters and offices for about 2-1/2 hours. Air India seems to have completely lost the point that a flight scheduled for a certain time is expected to fly at that time. A couple of other flights of other airlines departed (to Bengaluru) during that time, then, the staff coolly told me that there are no other flights until 12.10 to Bengaluru, I had missed any of the other airlines so what choice do I have?? So I sat back to wait. I asked about refreshments for the lengthy delay. They told me i could go to a food outlet called Indian Kebab. So, I tried to find it. It was well-hidden and you need googlemaps and a guide to find this place. After locating it, I found it closed. If I wanted to complain, I have to go back out of the security because there are are no Air India staff to assist passengers anywhere else. What a brilliant plan!!!!
I am Indian by birth and spirit, and in general would have preferred Air India to other airlines simply because it is Indian. Unfortunately, the staff and management seem to go out of their way to ensure that they do every little bit to discourage anyone from using this airline."

This time I was travelling on 27th August from Chicago and I was surprised to see that one toilet had no water at all from the beginning of the flight only. With so many passengers almost full flight out of four toilet one is not working which is really not good for flight like air India."

4) The international flight from Del to JFK was pathetic, old plane, the entertainment remote was broken.
5) The touch for the entertainment system didn't work on a 16 hour flight.
6) The air hostress weren't much friendly, they seem have some other worries, they don't respond to the call button as well.
7) The liquor was served just 1.5 hour before landing.
8) Toilet papers in the washrooms were not there by the mid of the flight, they were not replaced.

I was travelling with my 73 year old Mum and they refused to give Wheel Chair assistance beyond the boarding desk at Mumbai. At Delhi Airport, they asked her to walk to the Gate when she was feeling very weak to do so. They even refused to call for a cart for her and other Wheel Chair pax... When complained to their Seniors, he simply said they were sorry for this insensitivity but agreed at the same time that should it have been a Minister or Celebrity, they would have been attended to without delay.

In order words I can term it as horrible. It was a long distance flight and I certainly expected better comfort from Air India. Highlighting my review in detail below.

Recline - Horrible. The push button to recline the seat was missing and I traveled the entire 12 hour journey in upright position. Lots of passengers faced issue wherein 
Legroom space - good, one can easily move in and out
Seat comfort - Pathetic. Stained and no cushions in the seat
Foot Rest - bad condition. They were free and could not be maintained at required height.

Food - Below Average. Cold food was served which wasn’t tasty either. It was hard to gulp down the food. Croissant shared in the morning were soggy. Even the water shared for tea was absolutely cold.

Hospitality - Pathetic. Air hostess was quite cold and even on raising alarum calls, they would not come at your seat. One has to eventually get up and reach pantry area to get the required help. Food was served in haste and there was no gap in between the welcome drink and the food served. It appeared that they had to wind up everything quickly so dump stuff as quickly as they could.

Flight checkin and travel time - Excellent. We reached 15 min early than the arrival time and also the checkin experience at Paris Airport was good.

In flight Entertainment - Average. Wide variety of movies were there however the head phones were distorted. Majority of them had voice cracking issues and low sound quality.

Hope the above review helps when you decide to choose your flight. Happy Travelling."

Reminded me of my last flight on United. The male CAs were kind of okay and friendly, but one young female CA seemed she had better things to do.
Seats and tables were relatively worn, but probably as expected on average A321s in Asia.  
One thing I was quite surprised was that many passengers were on cell phone out loud though the plane was already moving away from the gates. CAs did not seem to mind. Last passenger to stop, or  so it seems, did so when we were on the runway. 
May be the rules changed? I know that radio waves seldom have negative impact on the flight itself, according to some research, but loud voices are nuisance. 
The web-sites did warn about large voices exchanged even after lights are turned down, and I confirmed that, along with some fancy Indian music played loudly from smartphones. Can't blame them as there were no on-flight entertainment, naturally.
Meal was quite good, I must say, for an economy class, as I am fond of Indian spicy foods. Indian wine, which was my first, was actually not bad as well.
It was interesting, as the isle is so narrow, CAs had to forcefully bump into seats many time to move the wagons through. 
Again, thanks to many advance warnings, I was not too surprised."

As Air India departs from T3 international airport and that's to with separate gate all Together, it was mess. People just don't know how to board flight and it was hush hush situation.

Many passengers were govt employee so you know what happened when they board, they actually feels air India is owned by them so you can't help.

People were Crossing line putting bags and Air India staff give privilege to all those Govt employee without thinking others has paid too.

Well on boarding it was Kind of ""ok' to me. Food was just nice nothing fancy...most importantly flight was on time. Leg space is good, what's makes more important to trave with AI l is that you  can take baggage more then any other airline and that's what makes more important. specially for those who can't travel light.

As the only India-Australia direct flight, AI has a monopoly on this sector. For me, one long-haul flight is better than two flights with hours hanging about another airport. So I was prepared to risk it again. This review updates my earlier experience. 

My daughter and I travelled together in Business Class on the SYD-DEL sector. The experience of travelling to India from Australia was so different from my India to Australia journey last year that it could have been with another airline. The ground staff were not only warm and welcoming, they were downright helpful. A minor hiccup in our booking was straightened out rapidly and without fuss. The flight staff were also engaging and helpful, offering refreshments at the right times, smiling and being like the staff of other airlines. We received a useful amenities pack at the beginning of the flight, rather than at the end as was my last experience. It was an amazing difference and the flight was very, very good. 

The Dreamliner is a relatively quiet plane and the business class beds are quite flat and comfortable. The staff helped us with blankets and quilts (although they didn't have enough to go around, so they were suitably apologetic). 

The food was excellent and there was a reasonable amount of choice. Other airlines offer a printed menu to allow business class passengers to contemplate their options and see what between-meal snacks might be on offer. AI does not do this, but it would be a welcome addition. Please do this, AI!

AI still needs to sharpen its act in the air. The planes look pretty tired and as a passenger I wonder if the cabin maintenance mirrors the mechanical maintenance (ouch). 

Given this very good experience I'll take AI again on the India-Australia run. I wonder if it's always better in one direction than another?"

I do opt for the international flights i.e. AI-310/314 for Bom-Del and AI-191  for my return journey. The flights are operated by Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 777-300er respectively. Both the flights are superb . You always get a warm gesture by the crew on both of this flights. The check-in is quick. The food quality that is provided is just awesome. It is fresh always. Yes, there are delays for the flight but that has to be understood by travelers as the airspace for both of these airports is congested and being the night flights international traffic have to be given a priority. But the delay is very minimal as it gets covered  up en route. Also you don't have to wait for hours to collect your baggage. Overall I would recommend these flights to everybody if you want to experience Indian hospitality."

Slept for a while, woke up with dry throat, after for juice and was told go and get it yourself from the counter.  Later there was some disturbance between some other passengers, so the flight attendant told me he would be sitting one of these people next to me. Initially he ignore more protests until I spoke in Hindi and said I was in the media.  There were three vacant seat at the very back which could have easily been used.  However these are kept for the flight attendants to sleep themselves."

I can accept that sometimes nothing can be done, however it's when no attempt is tried that you wonder if really this was just down to people or a corporate style. No attempt to explain, no attempt to look for alternative seating, no empathy and certainly no sympathy. A hostile customer stance.
The worst thing was that when we returned and logged an official complaint no attempt at contact aside from the usual return e mail confirming receipt.
I guess you get what you pay for and we deserve trying to shave a few pounds off the flight but it was a learning curve. I would never fly with this airline again, nor because something wasn't technically working but because of the distain that passengers are held ."

Where to begin.....the Business Class lounge was pathetic. There were a few old samosas and a coffee machine. It was small and dingy. Many a fellow passenger went, looked around, and promptly left to get food and wait for the flight elsewhere. 
Once on the flight, everything looks dated. Not all of our chairs fully reclined, and I’m not sure if the food or service was worse. The flight attendants were completely inconsistent- my daughter received a toiletries bag, but others did not. I had to ask twice before receiving one. Only 3 of us received duvets. After my father asked twice, the flight attendant showed him that they were in the overhead bin, where he could get one. They also ran out of salmon in both directions, so several members of our party were forced to order the mush that they called food (and subsequently didn’t eat). They only had nuts for snacks....I could go on and on. Needless to say, we will never fly Air India again."

So my carryon bag I had to use a checked bag, which had a lot of personal stuff in it so not very happy about being without that. I even contacted them, and they said they would call me but never did. The bag only weighed like 24 lbs, but it had to be under 18 lbs. I don’t know what my bag looks like yet and if anything is damaged, but when I arrived in Delhi, my bag had been banged up and ripped, as was my luggage tag. We’ll see if it was just a one time thing, but I’m betting it wasn’t. I will give it a 6 out of 10, but not happy with regards to their all around handling of luggage."

At the airport, at Air India baggage screening I was asked if I was carrying mobile phones in my check in baggage which I was. It was for the first time that I was asked to remove the phones and keep in hand baggage. However, I was exempted from removing the same when I informed the staff that the phones were Blackberry phones and were in power off mode. Check in was smooth and barely took a couple of minutes. Incoming flight 629 arrived a few minutes before time and hence all passengers were on board well before time. However, we were made to open our hand baggage again for security checking at the time of boarding the aircraft and told that this was a airline requirement. Anyways, we had the most comfortable economy seats in terms of space and enjoyed the chill of the blast from the air-conditioning. The safety detailing was the poorest I have ever heard on any aircraft. i had asked for a Vegetarian Continental meal but we were served some piping hot rice with dal and brinjal veg that I absolutely loved. Liked the way the Flight Officer shared information on the aircraft we were flying and its variants, the height we were flying at and I was thrilled to know the path we were flying. Flying over Akola, Bhusawal, Jalgaon, Dhulia, Nashik and then descending into Mumbai.

Contrary to what I heard about Air India, this flight experience was far superior to other US based airlines that I had been traveling internationally in the past 19 years. The staff was very pleasant and eager to serve and make you happy onboard and during the check in. 

If you like Indian food, then this flight offered above average food options. I did not not opt for Alcohol though they offered duting in-flight service.

The bathrooms were relatively clean and not worse than other US airlines. The price I paid was reasonable too.

The best part of this flight is that it is less than 14 hours stratight to Delhi. You save valuable time. I did not experience much jetlag due to the flight timings, both going in and out. My flight reached before scheduled time both at DC and and in Delhi.

I would definitely recommend Air India for this route. Only suggestion is that you carry your own entertainment and not rely on theirs. Theirs is not reliable and I saw several screens were not working, including mine. My children had working screens, so it was not an issue for them.

I hope that Air India would invest  money to make the interior of this aircraft comparable to other Gulf based airlines. However I would rather fly direct to Delhi than to reach Dubai in the same time that it takes and then spend another four to six hours to reach Delhi.

If you can ignore cosmetics and in-light entertainment issues then this is the flight to take to go to Delhi from DC. There is no other flight connection faster than this direct route."

However, the movie selection was awfully limited, plus my headphones and my next of seat’s were not working. In order to get some new, the button for calling a member of the staff was COMPLETELY useless. Having been given two faulty pairs, I had to walk down the aisle twice to finally get a third (functioning) pair. We had been given lunch, which was good, although the hostess could not give exhaustive info about its content: she just said “chicken or mix veg” and could not be bothered to say more. Although lunch was tasty and warm, the following snack was a freezing cold croissant. I managed to sleep during most of the flight, even if my seat was the last one before the toilet, positioned next to the aisle, and therefore get kicked most of the times a completely careless hostess/host would pass with the cart. When I woke up and asked for a cup of tea stopping a hostess down the aisle, I could not tell whether she said yes or no as she mumbled something without making eye contact. After 10 minutes of wondering whether or not she did understand what I asked for, she then came back with a tea which was not hot anymore, and in which there were already sugar and milk (I am lactose intolerant). 
So, overall, just a bad service with employees looking at you as if they were doing you a favour, probably forgetting that I have to pay what for me is a big amount of money to travel with them. As a post scriptum, I would also like to point out that I can imagine the struggles that the job implies being a waitress myself: but I also think that if you cannot give your customers a smile and try being as much helpful & well-disposed as possible, hospitality is definitely not your ideal career."

Although the plane was relatively new, none of the video equipment where we were sitting were not working - remote controllers had partly no control buttons, even screens were not working and touch control did not work.

We loved our trip, the Maharaja’s staff and food. Since then, I’ve traveled different airlines in various parts of the world, including government run ones big and small.

When AI started its non-stop service from Washington in 2017, I happily took it again.  Sadly, the standard of this flight is starkly much below my first early experiences; not what one would expect from India’s flagship today.  

Here are observations and suggestions from my round trip from IAD to Delhi (Oct/Nov 2017):

1)	With all the tech professionals India produces, can AI not provide us with Wi-Fi for the 14-15hour flights?

2)	The TV monitors and service was out-of-order much of the time on both legs – no entertainment is entirely unacceptable.

3)	Make sure the seats are cushioned and covered adequately (an issue of supervising the tailors?); the headrest covers were missing.

4)	Add a positive attitude to flight service; the crew ignored calls for service between meals, and seemed not to enjoy serving people.  

5)	Beverage service was not provided until hours into the flight, and not enough.  Other airlines are much better – some are very frequently coming through on even 8 hour flights.  15 hour flights need more hydration is needed.

6)	Meals are full of carbohydrates, too salty and spicy (not tasty) - rather unhealthy for such a long flight.  India has yummy healthy cuisine that I am sure the chefs can whip up if asked.  Simple dal, chawal, and real sabzi (not paneer) would be fantastic – add a little pickle packet and a couple green chillis for those who want to spice it up.

7)	And how about plain yogurt with our meals - this one fabulous part of Indian meals is missing. 

8)	A pouch of sonf would be a nice touch with each meal!!

9)	Whole fresh fruit for snacking would be a welcome and healthier option, as offered by most international carriers.  

I hope you are reading this AI, and take these suggestions as intended - constructively.

Make us proud, again.

p.s. At this point, the only reason to fly AI IAD to Delhi is the flight timings."

The timings of the flight and the cost make it a very attractive option. The flight leaves New Delhi late night and by early morning you are in JFK.

There are no food menu on the flight (though special meals are served) which is fine as most travellers are Indians and they don't take any meal except chicken or vegetarian. The airline believes in good service and comfortable flight. Nothing fancy and that's what on offer as well.

Ground staff is helpful as usual and prompt. FA's are nice and helpful as well. If you talk with them nicely (and not boss around) they are really helpful and you can chat about what to do in the city you are travelling to.

The middle east airlines are highly overrated, specially their economy cabins and do not offer anything extra that  Air India does not. After all, the people travelling are also same. 

Etihad and Emirates operate A380 to JFK with a 3-4-3 configuration, whereas Air India  operates B777-300ER with 3-3-3 configuration. So, the cabin feels much more open and relaxed and not at all conjusted. Also, this means no waiting for restrooms and quicker check-in, baggage claims etc."
"2018-08-05T01:43:50-04:00","3","review","0","First time on a scheduled flight!","Like many I had some concerns regarding Air India but to be honest I booked the flights for the price - £400 cheaper for three of us compared to the other operators. The flight itself was fine, we enjoyed the food in the main, found the service from the cabin crew efficient if not overly friendly (not a problem), and the inflight entertainment was better than I expected. There were no issues with dirty toilets as stated in other reviews and passengers were much better behaved and quieter than on many chartered flights. I was surprised that there was no opportunity to purchase duty free etc on board, neither could you purchase drinks or snacks etc BUT as food and drink was provided this was a nice surprise rather than being continually asked to buy different items. 
The main negatives for me was the uncomfortable seats and trying to contact and communicate with Air India - as I had purchased our seats via an agent I failed in just about every way to contact Air India to check that all paperwork etc was in place for the flight. I eventually (after many failed attempts) spoke via the online chat which allayed any fears and also reserved seats for us but I couldn't contact them to do so for the return journey. The online checkin for the return journey allocated us seats in different rows and stated there were no other available seats! At Newark, the checkin staff helpfully allocated us seats all together, and that flight also had many empty seats! Beware the website and online options for the airline was the bottom line for me.
I would fly with Air India again but like many things it would depend upon the price and the price of other operators."

The good points first - boarding was a breeze and we left on time and landed in Mumbai early (despite the awful weather on arrival). Chicken was surprisingly good albeit a tiny portion. Multiple bad points though... The 777-300 ER was a mess. Like a mess. My seat was broken and looked like it had been left for a few years in a garbage dump (complete with sweat stains on the arm rests and an absolutely nauseating smell the likes of which I’ve never experienced on an airplane before (and I’ve flown on some pretty sketchy airplanes). I’ve also never ever been on a flight which had zero beverage service. Not water. Not juice. Not soda. Keep in mind this is biz class and it wasn’t a cheap ticket. Service was non-existent and the FA gave off an interesting “I hate the world” kind of vibe. Moral of this story is Air India should be ashamed of themselves. If you want to experience who I suspect is the worst carrier in the world (I’d take Air China in a heartbeat), I heartily endorse Air India. If you don’t, you’d be wise to RUN away from them.

Their flight have 
1. NO entertainment service (Dead monitors - USB ports are literally broken). 
2. You're fed twice in 17 hours. 
3. Besides two meals you won't be asked for anything (Coffee or water). 
4. Bathrooms are clogged and dirty as you can imagine. 
5. The attendants give zero care when you raise issues on the in-flight service. 

Literally, pack yourself in a box and ship it via AirIndia. Cauz that's what they are doing with humans in 17-hour flight. 

Please avoid and pay little extra to Emirates."

Waited at the counter for more than 2 hours with no assistance from the airline staffs but I kept on disturbing them every now and then as the next flight available was after 13 hours. 
Somehow 15 minutes before departure, they arranged me a ticket knowing that the issue was solely happened from their software side.

Areas to be looked at :
1 no service of alcohol on this sector. Do not know the reason as most of the other airlines do the same.
2. Better dining experience as the menu option was only veg/ chicken biriyani. Not that this matters as normally I do lot have a meal at the late evening flights.
3. The AI lounge in Delhi really needs some immediate supervision. No non veg options in the starters, spotted cutleries and dirty counters. All the items on the buffet was Indian which might not suit an international traveler pallet always. 

Over all a good experience.

The usual airline truck of overbooking! We got in eventually after insisting ( going back to work and connecting flights), but only 2 of us not the 2 others.
Once in the plane we waited 2 hrs ( apparently techn prob), with doors closed getting suffocating, not much communication either, only from the capitaine!! Then eventually, they had to open the doors as babies were in distress and later, we were evacuated from the plane with profuse apologises, change gates to board the same plane “ fixed”.

Being the national carrier of India, In my opinion, Air India should be the best airline to travel in but unfortunately, it is the worst. 
Starting from check-in counter, least interested in good customer service, they are there just to do their job of collecting luggage( I mean where is the politeness?), then you move on to the boarding gate: as usual, Air India flights are late and the boarding staff have no idea of tackling the customers at that time (maybe they don't get adequate information). Now if we talk about the in-flight experience, there are screens attached to each seat but they don't work. Cabin Crew is pretty out of trend as compared to the other carriers. ( Maybe they are not trained about good customer service). Is it a crime to be a non-vegetarian if you are travelling on an Air India flight? What kind of rule are they imposing on us? Only vegetarian meals in the domestic sector. Let me also mention the aircrafts they are plying in the domestic sector: ""Worst than a 20-year-old state transport bus.

Coming onto the flight, on the whole a comfortable flight however an old aircraft A320 which has its own issues plus the icing on the cake is the Air Hostess Onboard whom I have generally found to be rude.

These marathon flights are about 13 hours long, so AI deserves a lot of credit for the safe journey.  Food was served three times and it was good (Indian style cuisine).  I took economy class and I don’t think it’s something I will do again because the leg room really stunk do and such a long flight. I considered business class, but it was about double the ticket price.  I’ll have to research other airlines and possibly do a connecting flight. Economy non stop is a good value, but I’m not sure if it’ll do it again. Inflight technology was antiquated and I can’t believe the airplane did not have WiFi available.  The cabin definitely needs a refresh and upgrade.  The only reason I’d consider this flight again is they are the only non stop from NY.  They really need to spend some money to spruce up the amenities and ambiance for the flight.

Domestic flights in India:
I traveled from DEL to Kolkata, then from Varanasi to DEL ok AI.  I was very happy with the service.  I actually took another airline from Kolkata to Varanasi because they were the only ones to have a direct flight and I was not happy with how they nickel and dime you.

Just to be sure, as we arrived in Amritsar we went to the airport to check in person, to be told the flight had been delayed but not cancelled.
To be allowed into an airport in India you have to have a ticket, so presented ourselves for the delayed flight time, only to be told we couldn't enter the airport because the flight had left at the original time and that we'd missed it! Turned out it wasn't true but had to talk our way in.

They didnt let around 20 people to board the flight even when we were on time. They wasted our time so that they can mark us late.
They wont even refund your money
The worst part is they wont even let you exit. Even after cancelling your flight they got problem with you exiting the airport.  
There are other competitive flights with customer friendly staff. I would prefer to use other airlines to avoid all the drama"

Here are the worst features of my travel.
1. No entertainment for 14+ hours flight. Several of the TVs are not working, if TV display works for few, either remote or headsets doesn't work. 
2. Food tray table is bent and I had to literally hold the tray to keep the food in place.
3. Luckily my seat recliner worked too much and my next seat's recliner didn't work at all. I feel sorry for the guy sitting behind me, as my seat was gone too much back when I use the reclining button.
4. Food is not good at all. I traveled in Air India 10+ years back and at that time food was the only positive thing travelling in Air India, now it is bad. Tomato in the salad was smelling bad.
5. Flight is very old. Not suitable for travel for 15 hours.
6. I bought the ticket in Feb 2018 for travel in June and I called the airline and choose my seats. But in April 2018, when I checked my travel plan, all the seats I choose are changed and they randomly assigned seats. When I called back about this, I was asked to pay extra to get my original seats assigned back to me. Family of 4 got seats at 4 different places. I had to request other passengers to make adjustments. Finally 2 of my family member sat at one place and other 2 at a different place. Very very poor service regarding this.

The only positive thing in this journey was the leg room in the flight was better compared to other airlines. 

I don't recommend this flight if you have other alternate flights to choose."

That there is a direct flight from US to India is really heart warming. The food on this flight is outstanding and is ideal for Indian parents visiting America. It is also ideal for young mothers traveling with their kids because the only layover is in India. Worst thing about this flight was the inefficiency of ground staff.

They have a standard 2-2-2 business class which is not cutting edge. However, I found the product to be very comfortable. The seats are low flat and I managed to get great sleep on it. Their service is also exceptional! The have a full bar and serve Lansons Champagne (they’ve recently switched from H Blin) and have a good selection on wines and liquor.
The food on AI, I have always found to be very good. Not fancy, but wholesome. Indian food stays well in aircrafts and they serve a full meal on a tray which includes a salad, main course accompanied by a vegetable, rice and multiple breads, desserts, cheeses and chocolates!
They are also priced very reasonably compared to Cathay Pacific and Jet Airways on the sector and it’s totally worth flying with them."

Also in lunch / Dinner/ whatever..four times...Rice Rice Rice Rice and Bread. I refuse to eat two time.  I spent $ 5800 on 4 tickets and get this type of service ?  Also the flight is not the international standard.  Feel like sitting on hard board seat. Feel burning sensation around my butt after 6 hours. No more Air India.

On top of that they cacelled the domestic flight altogether. And gave alternate flight which has 14 hrs of layover in Delhi aurport. So I booked sleeping pod for them by spending 8000 extra. These air india people didn't allow to go to security so wasted 8000 as there is no refund.

Also they have boarding pass for Chicago flight for only father not mother. For her boarding pass they made them wait fot 2 hrs.

So guys don't get trapped in Air India trap of food and Hindi language. Which was my mistake.

PLEASE DONT TRAVEL USING AIR INDIA IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET FRUSTRATED.

THE STAFF IS VERY RUDE. THEY SHOW US SOME RULES AND POLICIES AND TRY TO EXTRACT MONEY AND GIVE MORE INCOVINIENCE.

"2018-07-17T21:25:42-04:00","4","review","1","Not fancy, but very efficient","Normally, service providers are good till the time some goof-up happens. So the real test of an airline is how they respond to such issues.
Overall, the service of Air India has improved VASTLY over the last few years. Their UK flight from Delhi is also amazing. If you are not too stuck up on non-veg and appearances, the food and service on domestic flights is as good (or bad) as the other airlines.
So in this particular flight from Delhi to Chennai, I forgot my Kindle on my seat. My impression was that I could forget about it as I would never get it back. However, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.
I have never received more polite service from any other airlines in this matter. The baggage services (Mr. RajKumar at Chennai in particular) was very supportive in identifying, verifying and returning the device.
As this was not my normal route of flying, I went to collect the device after two months. I was amazed to find the same in pristine condition and had absolutely no issues in getting the same back.
Kudos to the National Airline. I hope they get out of the financial mess and rule the skies again."

"2018-07-15T21:29:24-04:00","2","review","4","Awful experience Air India team please pull your selves up","The overall experience in a Dreamliner was made awful thanks to the cabin crew including one Mr. Kanth (can't remember his full name). There was utter confusion in the cabin post boarding - there was a big group of school students going back to India and they had been allotted different seats. They were requesting the passengers if they could help them so that they could sit as a group. The passengers were more than willing to help them out but the cabin crew was not making any efforts to help or clear confusion. I also on request changed the seat and got an aisle seat in the middle block. The school students were polite and helpful and one of them helped me with my handbag which had to be kept in overhead baggage area - I was not helped by the cabin crew - they were not even visible. There was no help being provided by the cabin crew. My seat was having some mechanical issues - I complained when the plane was on the ground in London but nothing was done. The seat pocket had used tissues, toffee wrappers and an empty water bottle (it had not been cleaned). The entertainment system on my seat was not functional. I rang the bell for the cabin crew 5 times but no one came. The plane left London and then they started serving refreshments with utmost disinterest. I informed the cabin crew member serving in our lane about the issue but he was not bothered. When he came back to clean the tray I reminded him again of the issue, he was still not bothered. After some time I dozed off as I was dead tired and had been having less sleep for the last 2 days. The dinner was served with utmost disinterest again. Why does Air India ask for meal preferences in the ticket when they were not interested in giving those meal options – the only choice they were giving is Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian. 
Other thing which I realised was the cabin crew on this flight was at its shabbiest best – out of the 2 male pursers Mr. Kanth was having a pot belly and had a dirty uniform(wonder how was he surviving as a cabin crew member). The lady crew member was no better off – an elderly lady who again didn’t have an iota of smartness and alertness, she was looking tired and like a school teacher from some government school.  Mind you I have seen some smart looking elegant elderly female crew members with Air India earlier also – this lady was far from that. 
Once dinner was served the cabin crew team (including an elderly lady vanished behind the curtains). Even after half an hour with many people ringing bells, no one appeared. I got and walked up to the area where they were sitting and chatting away – gave my tray and asked them why were they not attending to the issues – Mr. Kanth immediately replied we know about your problem and would resolve once we are in Delhi – how would it help me once we are in Delhi as the flight is till Delhi only. He came down to my seat cribbing why couldn’t I sleep, why did I need the entertainment option and how overworked he was. He tried resetting the system, though he himself had told me nothing’s going to happen and then rudely told me that I better sit and wait.
After 40 minutes they started clearing the trays, most of the people had dozed off or were dozing off and it was really uncomfortable with those trays still there. 
Another crew member Ms. Mousami appeared this time. She requested for something from Mr. Kanth and voila Mr. Kanth drops a dirty spoon and a small bowl from one of the used trays on my head. I was really angry now and asked them if he had some specific issues. Ms. Mousami was the one who apologised and not Mr. Kanth and was trying her level best to control the situation.
By this time I had realised the best thing to do would be to sleep and wait to reach Delhi. 
It was really sad that there is so much being talked about how Air India, national airlines is going down the drain, but the Airline team itself is the one which is pushing down the drain. 

I had travelled in Air India to London just a week back (AI161) and the experience was definitely much better. In this flight nothing was right – no cleaning, rude and shabby crew, no inflight safety information (on the entertainment screen), no introductions, nothing. 
Air India – please retrain your crew members and have some benchmarks.
Will think twice before I take Air India again. No wonder I hadn’t picked my domestic connections with Air India – when they can be awful in the international leg imagine how they would be in the domestic leg"

We've managed to get our seats in one row after some deliberation with check-in staff, who promised that we were all together only to discover on the plane that we had to ask a passenger if we could swap seats so that we can be together. However, this was no surprise to us. We knew that the girl at check-in wasn't telling us the truth and simply passed us on and left us to deal with the issue once we were on the plane. Sadly we were not the only family in the same situation. There were other two families who were in the same situation and somehow the staff moved them together by asking other passengers to move. It was a debacle. Another chaos was caused by too many large bags and items carried on the plane. There was simply no room for everyone to put their bags into the overhead lockers. Toilets needed regular cleaning. Otherwise, the flight was Ok."

The return trip was delayed 6 hours, and we didn't find out until we got to the airport. Couldn't the airline have sent a text or called the passengers to let us know? After spending a sleepless night at the airport, we are on our way. We have a meal and settle down to sleep. A few hours later all the cabin lights go on and the staff is serving ""lunch."" This may be the time a second meal is served on a regular flight, but after being delayed for so long  it would have been nice to allow passengers to sleep, specially in business class. So all in all this is a mixed review for Air India. Pros include a direct flight, quality staff, and decent food. Cons are flight delays, old planes, a lack of communication, limited in-flight entertainment, and being woken up to eat."

Flight was delayed at last moment even after rolling back from parking bay .however the flying crew was proficient and professional that it informed about the delay and also managed to land in time. In flight Cabin crew was excellent -courteous and adjusting. in flight service was great. The quality ,quantity,and Menu was not upto international standards and definitely needs to be looked at. Overall  I think the best direct connection from New Delhi to San Francisco for first timers, senior citizens,ladies travelling alone or with small children-a very convenient and hassle free flight."

There travel magazines says that you can reserve the seats without any cost. You may be able to do that and you get a confirmation email too but later if you visit their website again, your booking of seats is changed.
The web site will force you to pay (which I had to do eventually) because of the seats allocated automatically were highly uncomfortable.
My counsel; Be aware!"

We did a check in the previous everning and we were informed the flight was delayed & scheduled for 13.50 in the afternoon. After reching the airport & doing the checking and all, we learnt the flight was delayed further on account of some malfunctioning of AI's computerised systems. Hence they were manually allotting  seats to passengers.. No announcements was made for the delay.  It resulted in a mess as there was double booking of seats and a bunch of irate passengers who wanted to be seated with their family members. The flight finally took off at 2.30 pm  and reached chennai at 3.30..The second connecting flight had the same issues- manfunctioing computers & manually issued tickets. It again took another extra hour to sort out the mess as the flight was running full on both the flights .e. madhurai-chennai & chennai-mumbai.

Finally the second flight took off only at 5pm and reached Mumbai at 7pm a delay of almost 2 1/2 hours (schedulerd to arrive at 16.50 pm).

The only saving grace was that both flights , AI served decent snacks to passengers.

but the experience left a bitter taste in the mouth, I swore never to taken another AI flight in the future as I believe the malfunctioning computers is a common feature with all Air India flights.

"2018-07-06T22:57:38-04:00","2","review","1","Schedule - Good; Everything else - Terrible","AI 126 on a B773 VT-ALN.

The positives first: 
You cannot beat AI on scheduling if you desire a quick non-stop trip to India, all done in about 13 hours. If you are connecting to major Indian cities like Hyderabad or Bangalore or Chennai, you may even skip the notoriously crowded Delhi immigration line and transit directly to your connecting terminal after a security check. Immigration and customs can be done at your destination city. AI's strong domestic network might help if you are delayed. Unfortunately, this is the only advantage of this flight.

The bads:
Having experienced excellent in-flight service from the likes of Emirates, Etihad and even Jet Airways, I found Air India terrible.
. 
First, the aircraft itself: the interiors have aged badly, very badly. At my seat 20K, I found a panel between the floor and the lower portion of the wall missing, resulting in a huge gaping dark hole, right next to me. If anything fell off your pocket into that hole, you might never get it back. The armrests were loose and filthy. The tray table, made of two flat pieces, was not flat, and the section closest to you drooped down. Good luck holding that food tray all the time if you don't want to mess your clothes. The plastic covering panels of the seat in front of me was loose and moving. My seat would not recline fully, and wouldn't come back after that little recline.

The in-flight entertainment: I just wish it wasn't there. Looked and felt like a cheap under-powered system, taking ages to register a button push. My hand remote was broken and came in two halves, but thankfully worked. I will take a cellotape with me next time. Mind you, mine was not a touch screen - you need that remote!! After browsing through the content, I realized I might not need that remote after all. External cameras did not work. In the middle of the first meal service, the entertainment system crashed. The system restarted an hour later, but they probably forgot to reload the map visualization and flight information features of the IFE. Until the very end of the flight, I didn't know where on Earth we were over, literally.

Food: Mediocre. The cheapness was apparent from the food containers, which were strong enough to be squished by babies, and covered with layers and layers of transparent plastic sheets apparently packaged by hastily showing that plastic over a candle. The tray itself was dirty. Food aesthetics was not on Air India's list, it looked as bland as the taste.

Toilets: Oh boy. There was no handwash soap, Eau De Cologne, moisturizer, or paper towels. Let me not talk about the crapper.

Crew: They did not seem to particularly enjoy doing their job. Pillows were loaded on the flight, but were not distributed!! Thankfully, my seatmate walked to the galley and got me a pillow. Crew call pings were completely ignored. If you had a window seat with two sleeping grandmas next to you, good luck getting a water bottle.

Safety: POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE - The aircraft was noisy, maybe due to that missing floor panel at my seat. Because of the noise, I couldn't make out what the crew said during their announcements. Not just me, but people in seats around me. In case of any emergency requiring an evacuation, good luck, please pray.
Others: Air India is an ailing airline. Yet, about 8 Business class revenue seats were cordoned off as a crew rest area. Dear Air India, let me give you a slightly better idea - give a couple of those seats to aircraft interior maintenance techs.

Overall: If Air India's non-stop schedules do not thrill you, and if you are generally less lucky, avoid this airline and take one of those Middle Eastern carriers. There is no fare advantage between them and Air India if you book sufficiently in advance.

PS: This review is for Air India's international sector only. My India domestic short flights with them have been generally good. The interiors of their most common A320s, food and everything else is 'usual' or 'normal'."

Also, there is no apology at all for this incident. There is a great improvement among this delay flight.

Personal TV for 2 of the 3 of us did not work and asked the staffer who said she “reset it” and never heard back. When asked again she said she will “reset it again” and no follow up and we didn’t it for the entire 15 hour flight. The LCD TVs and the interior shows their age, cracks in places of the plastic moldings and TV display quality definitely needs update. 
Domestic route  in India:
We flew Delhi Mumbai last night and asked for a blanket for my daughter  and the hostess disappeared without a clue. Rang the bell again and they never showed up. This is in a flight which was one hour late to take off and ended up not able to land (again delaying)past midnight because of heavy rains in Mumbai. The food quality was good-but staffers too serious. I know there are many nice staffers out there and it will be wrong to label the entire team - but as of now I rate their service as poor based on my recent experiences."

The person in charge on AirIndia desk at that time was Mr. Awhad Gautam and he was very disrespectful and never looked into our eyes to say a word, just looked to show how much he didn’t care. He was on his mobile all the time and seated there. Just got up to ask the security from the airport to follow us until we finished the payment of the fee for the extra weight, to make sure we are paying the correct amount. They let us be 1h in the counter for the payment, nobody else was there to pay nothing, just us, and we got almost out of the time to board. We have tried in every way to talk to Mr. Awhad Gautam about this abusive fee, I showed him their own Air India website that was clearly saying we were compliant with our bags, he said he couldn’t agree with that. We regularly fly through this route, never more with Air India. Stay away from Air India, and when in Mumbai stay away from Mr. Awhad Gautam."

The aircraft should have arrived before 8 pm for cleaning and maintenance teams to have done their jobs and prepared the aircraft for our DEL- HYD flight on June 28. 

The AI officials OBVIOUSLY knew about the delay but did not bother to make a timely announcement. They also failed to make an announcement for gate change. I saw a big family settling on assigned gate 32A and then run further and then come back and then leave and so on. Finally, other passengers figured out the gate was changed.to 34A. It was not far but does Air India bother about its senior/old, mothers with kids, disabled and other passengers??

At 34A, each time a passengers asked when was the aircraft expected to land the officials kept saying ""5 minute or 10 minutes or 5-7 minutes"". Well, the aircraft landed after 10:15 pm. The wheels took off at 10:59pm A delay of almost 2 hours! 

Poor in-flight announcements. Cleanliness, food service, food quality, seat comfort were all great. Careless luggage handling. My brand new luggage was damaged. 
This is one company where I believe training cannot help. The employees from pilots to cabin crew and airport staff should be replaced by young blood from elite work background. 
AI will continue to sell because of the generous luggage allowance and good food may be. No in-flight entertainment - old long-haul aircraft is used for domestic flights. I value seat comfort n leg-space so AI is not bad if you can bear the delays and unprofessional attitude of  AI's airport staff. Check-in staff was still ok"

I still do not know why we had to queue so often and for so long.
Perhaps the airline should have issued new boarding cards (printed) and given them to us.

It proved to be an experience which re-affirmed the belief that I flew the typical Sarkari (government ) airline. And irony was that this flight had to fly from Delhi to Chicago !
The nightmare was the return journey during which 
1. there was practically scant air conditioning in the rear of the plane where we were seated.
2. the seats were creaking upon slightest of the movement
3. the rubber sheath covering some cables beneath the seats was sliding and was pretty hot. When brought to the notice of the crew we were told that this is quite normal.
4. food served was horrible.
The only thing appreciable was the exceptionally smooth landing though the braking thereafter was hard decelerating the aircraft rather too fast."

The turnaround came while coming back, Air India provide a smaller aircraft A320. A320 is a very small aircraft which is mostly used for domestic flights. Long distance flights are uncomfortable. The Air India did not inform that the return aircraft will be a smaller aircraft Nor was it mentioned when I booked the ticket. This is not the first time that they have done this.

The food looked so bad we didn’t even touch it as we did not want to get sick. 
The attention of the cabin crew was so bad that even though they walked up and down the plane several times before take-off to check on seat belts, they missed the man in front of me who was on his mobile phone (!!) and continued to be on the phone as we took off and until he lost signal in the air!! This was utterly ridiculous and not to mention dangerous!

The toilets were disgusting, about acceptable in the first hour of the flight, but after 3 hours they were gross. Water (I can only hope that it was water) all over the floor and even excrement on the toilet seat in one! I had to try several before I was prepared to even go inside.

I am regular traveler of Air India and mostly using its services for International Routes. Fortunately, I always liked the services and feeling safe as well. Recently, I had experienced worst ever service among all my trips with multiple airlines. Safety should be primary concern which can’t be compromised. I didn’t feel safe at all this time. Aircraft was really in bad shape. It was so noisy inside which should not be. Mirror in WC was kind of broken and rather repairing, there was a workaround with tapes. I mean, it reflect the poor maintenance or no maintenance of the aircraft which could be for major components as well. In term of service, entertainment zone had some issues with controllers/USB connection and it was for around 8 travelers near to me out of 10 to 12 travelers. There was no pillow for anyone and flight was around 9 hours long. In flight fooding didn’t reflect any quality and status. Staff didn’t know much about airline hospitality culture. Pathetic and really risky. Now, I am worried again as I have return with same flight next week. This is really scary in one word. Please try to avoid Air India for some time."

Thankfully the smell did permeate into the business class cabin -an immediate sense of relief overcame me.
 In the old days on entering the business class cabin there would be a crew member offering a choice of either orange juice or champagne. For the last few flights this small gesture has stopped. 
Once airborne in flight refreshments and the food was adequate. Nothing to write home about. 
However once the meals have been served and cleared away the curtains were firmly pulled shut and I didn't see neither hide nor hair of any crew. 
Generally speaking I think flights AI142 and AI143 need to improve considerably to remain competitive. 
I would imagine most of the Business Class passengers are employed by the Indian Government so travel free.

We had a lot of heavy luggage that we did not want to take with us on the tour so we were delighted to find a left luggage office at Banagalore airport for collection on our return.

The service and the evening meal served by Air India was excellent, chosen from a wide range of options to suit all palates and diets. We arrived in good time at Delhi airport for our night-time travel to Shimla, arriving early the following morning."

AI 336 and while going back to Chandigarh from Bangkok it becomes AI 337. Both ways it takes 4 hours &10 minutes. It took off at 5.50 AM from Suvarnabhumi Airport BKK and passes  over Calcutta, after 2.30 Hrs. After about 40 minutes the take off for next 2 hrs. it suffered extreme turbulence and the plane was having jumping like spring doll everybody was extremely scared, and the clouds outside the window were dark and no visibility at all for two hours.Captain announced that crew to sit and leave the breakfast and coffee service and asked everybody to fasten their seat belt. May be in June that part of the globe has dense fog and black clouds, some passengers were suggesting emergency landing. After 2 hrs captain announced to start service and resume coffee.He also said we are above Kolkata now and sky was clear now and that we will now fly above Durgapur, Banaras,Delhi. But such experience for a long period of 2 hrs was really scary for everybody felt so. Once there was a jump of 10 ft high, what a scary shock it was. Co-pessenger next to me sweared to not to fly again. 
But google says turbulence has not caused a crashed in last 40 to 50 years, thank God."

We had a seaplane scheduled at 5pm(our resort was booked for 3 nights). Our flight was at 10am. So we should ideally reach male by 1:30 pm. Boarding started and everyone were on the flight. Just before take-off, pilot communicated there was a technical glitch and it would take an hour before we start. We were seated for almost 2 hours in the flight and they said there is a problem and asked to leave. We asked if they could provide another flight as so many and 4 pm in airport with a toddler and then decided to get into hotel as there was no sign of flight. We exchanged our number with a lady and asked her to call as we didn't believe in Air India staff. We were getting to hotel and the lady was kind enough to call and let us know they have arranged another flight at 7pm. She connected to manager and he was like ""yes the flight is scheduled and you have to reach here and proceed inside within an hour. Else we cannot help you."" First place, they did not bother to call us that the flight was ready and they were demanding for our arrival. We already lost one night of our holiday which was non-refundable. Worst experience ever with Air India. 

Another experience was with Jaisalmer based Air India flight. It got delayed so much that we couldn't catch the flight at stop-over. The connecting flight was Air India too. We asked it was their mistake and asked them to schedule another flight to Hyderabad from Mumbai. But they were least bothered and directly told ""we are not responsible. Please leave."" And they didn't even refund for the flight.

Starting in the Air India Lounge in Chicago, there was great food and alcohol choices. The area was busy and space was limited. Overall, it was really nice and far better than the one available in Delhi airport.
On the trip to Delhi, I could not ask for better service. The stewardesses were amazingly attentive, I dont think my glass was empty in 14 hours. Food options were really good too. Airline PJs were a nice addition available on my way to India but not on the return. There are about a dozen okay movies to watch in English (take your own headphones). Great experience with the staff on the way there.
In Delhi, the luggage took over an hour to get to baggage so I could go through customs which caused me to miss my connection. I later learned that you should mark your luggage as 'priority' if your layover is less than 3 hours in India. The gate staff gave me the runaround sending me to all associated desks to have my ticket cancelled/ripped up, terrible system by the airlines and airport. Though the new ticket was very reasonably priced, the customer service desk staff was slow, lazy and not very helpful to myself and other customers which also caused me to miss the flight 2 hours later. I was stuck in Delhi's lobby for over 12 hours and it was not a nice experience.  The check-in staff was very precise on not taking your bag outside of the 3 hour window which was very annoying.
The smaller flights were fine in India, decent service and food with comfortable and clean planes.The return flight from Delhi back to Chicago was not nearly as good but still enjoyable. I only experienced Air India for my trip in India but work fly with them again and recommend it."

I am vegetarian and no milk products so I choose, that option but to my surprise they told me they had run out of vegetarian and instead tried to offer me cheese sandwiches which I could not eat anyways. To my understanding and other flights if I select and particular meal or service that means it should be a priority that is the whole reason it's a package. I was very disappointed and to top it all there air hostess passed me twice as I tried to get her attention and I could not find a button to flag for assistance. The whole flight was disappointment to me. I gave one start, if it where possible I would not have given it. No wifi."

So the first thing they did this very day was to call and inform me that the flight was rescheduled from 1300 hours to 1430 hours. I din't know why until I got to the airport and saw myself. This was helpful in that I din't have to go to the airport. They also sent a message to inform me of same and also updated same on their website.

Why this flight was delayed? From what I saw, the flight almost flew to Delhi with an empty cabin, Passengers were sparsely seated with more empty seats. Nevertheless, with this there was the opportunity of free-sitting.

As expected, the take of was smooth  in the beautiful weather and refreshment was served almost immediately. If you read my review of this same flight from Chandigarh to Mumbai, meals are usually vegetarian meals, and this was not an exception!

Unlike other flights to Delhi we did less than two hours, more than thirty minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time.I could't tell if the pilot went faster.

Again, there was no flight update at all. I wondered if the pilots had slept badly the previous night or they had a quarrel with each other in the cockpit, which is what usually comes to mind  if flight updates are not given.

Overall, it was a beautiful flying time, in a clean, modern aircraft.

Then the pilot did a great job with a short and almost unnoticeable take off. In a very long while I haven't seen such a short take off of a passenger airline.

My problem was first, with flight updates. There was none till we reached Mumbai and we were about to land, I like flight update, before take off, during, and before landing.

Second, the food served on Air India is always vegetarian which I feel should not be. This a commercial airline, not just for Indians so foreign passers like me have no damn business with whatever any other passenger eats on-board. I should receive the ideal value for my money and this includes giving me a meal of my choice and not coercing me to become a vegetarian. It makes no sense to me. There should  be vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals for all."

(We thought we had plenty of time up our sleeves with the connection but no..an hour before domestic flight is required for check in that we had taken into account but immigration at 2am was heinous). Lesson learnt! There were no cheaper options for our time frame. We had travelled from New Zealand (on Thai Airways- fantastic flight). 
We had a tired giggle..First Class...it was less than an hours flight to Amritsar..maybe 40 minutes in the air. We had access to the Air India Lounge. With our 3 hour wait it was welcomed. A chance for breakfast and getting refreshed. The First Class flight itself was interesting. Like being back in the 60's ..tho we could watch movies..if we had time. A 'wee' apple juice was served on arrival. Food served was a Coleslaw (soggy) club sandwich (with plastic knife and fork) and a wee sweet biscuit. The air attendants were lovely. It was a nice surprise being served by Women on this flight as other internal India flights, Ive taken, only Males were the attendants. Just as soon as we settled in we were descending.

When I arrived for check in, I was told there was no seat at all for me! After waiting and stressing for 15 minutes, they found a seat right at the back of the aircraft in the middle section. (I had pre booked a widow seat).

I accepted the seat I was given, but after take off, realized the in flight TV did not work. The attendants were too busy with other matters to help immediately and when they did, they could not fix the problem. So I had to sit and stand, next to the toilet for the next 12 hours to Delhi. This was one of the worst experiences I have had with this airline.

My return flight was not a great deal better. I did get a window seat, but when I boarded, there was an elderly woman sitting in my seat. I asked the attendant to sort it out, but they just said, chose another seat. Finally the woman moved, as she was totally in the wrong row. 

Again, the TV screen did not work properly. The touch section of the screen did not work and the headphones were dodgy and I had to hold the connection in throughout the flight. One thing that was unusual was the lack of a physical safety briefing before the flight left Delhi.

I found the flight attendants on both flights rather poor. I have been flying with Air India for some years now, but I think it is time to change. One of the best things about this airline is that it flies direct from Sydney to Delhi non stop."

The cabin crew also misguided me by telling me that my checkin luggage will directly go to Mumbai whereas I had to collect my luggage in Delhi and re-checkin it again.

The seats will be uncomfortable.  There will not be enough leg room.  The in-flight entertainment will be regularly interrupted by PA announcements (23 times on this flight, only 2 of which were necessary).  Air India achieve all of this, but also find new ways to make it unpleasant.
For the two weeks or so before the flight I received numerous emails notifying me of schedule changes which, when I checked, weren't (except that we unexpectedly arrived an hour ahead of schedule and at the wrong terminal).
Despite reserving seats in advance on-line three times (the third time paying extra for the privilege because the for some reason the first two times were over-written) we were given non-adjacent seats at the very back of the aircraft at check-in.
Our boarding passes were checked no less than separate 13 times before boarding, and luggage x-rayed three times.
Boarding is chaotic and no longer done by row. That does not really matter though because, being India, no-one waits for their row number to be announced anyway.
Despite the aircraft being a Dreamliner, so relatively new, it was tired and scruffy inside, with plenty of stains and broken buttons.  And it smelt, nasty.
The free issue headsets are useless, but that does not really matter because the choice of movies is very limited and there is no music available. Bring a book.
Flight staff are, let's say, ""abrupt"" and despite being asked to elaborate on the menu options could only repeat ""veg or non-veg"" but louder. (""Non-veg"" was chicken curry, as it turned out).  Bring your own food.  (And ear-plugs too if like me you dislike the sound of fellow passengers smacking their lips as they eat)
Within a few hours of departure the toilets looked like they had been hosed down with dirty water (I mean seat, floor, walls, everything).  And that is every toilet on the aircraft.
On the plus side, Indian's don't generally drink and so have no idea about serving alcohol.  I asked for a whiskey and was given a plastic cup full to the brim.  I mean, about 200ml of whiskey. So I slept well."

- Airplane was un-suitable for 5+hrs of flying. After 3 hrs of flight there was a big que for toilet, as front toilets were barred for economy. 
- It was a small Aircraft Aurbus 322 used in domestic flights (3x3seating)
-Not enough blankets /pillows for all passengers (It's so unprofessional )
- There is no in-flight entertainment system
-Quality of plastic plates used in meals is pathetic. The finish of plastic bowls was 3rd grade. Can't be a part of international flight 
- Not enough food choice for foreign nationals
-Not enough beverage for non alcoholic passengers. Even juice were inadequate.

I think Air India needs to spruce up this flight with large aircraft like Boeing 777..

There needs to be a difference between domestic/international flight.

Good things:
New Aircraft
Liberal baggage allowance
Good Legroom
Un limited water bottles

The flights (Cochin to Delhi and Delhi to Frankfurt) took off right on time. The service inside the flight was exemplary. The seat comfort was quite good and being business class it was with flat beds. The Plane looked rather new.

This time I booked on Air India for both the onward and return. On both the flights, the experience was not worth mentioning, except for the seating comfort. The seats are quite comfortable compared to the other domestic airlines, probably the best. The legroom and the personal space are also great. But unfortunately, I cannot think of any other positive aspect about the flights. The staff (ground as well as in-flight) are nonchalant and indifferent, no choice of meals, flights delayed during departure. On the DEL-CCU flight, the food was served in a container made out of crush-able aluminium foil, like in the Indian Railways, and the container was half crushed. But even after all of these, the seat comfort is what actually made my flight not-so-bad. 
Just yesterday, I read the news that there are no takers for a stake in AI, but I feel that if this airlines is managed a little more professionally and with a pro-customer mindset, it can turn around and be the best airline in India."

After booking I read the reviews - note to self... get the sequence correct next time.... and I have to say I think on balance the reviews i read were pretty accurate. The outbound overnight business class was, in my view, poor and I’m not fussy or pretentious about it... just wanted a decent service and be able to sleep. The food choice was limited, but nice - but the demeanour of the cabin crew wasn’t great. Not offered any more drinks, help, assistance or such. The recline-to-bed seat isn’t long enough for a 6 foot tall person, and, when extended consists of missing sections of cushioning which makes it very uncomfortable. I resorted to trying to alleviate this with a doubled over duvet as a base and a thin sheet to keep the AC draught off me. Courtesy bag didn’t have earplugs nor eye mask, and, they don’t have them even when asked for. For something costing less than a quid this is shocking in my view. All in all a pretty unpleasant flight ; the domestic business class transfer is barely premium economy.
Having said all this..... the return from Delhi to UK was a different experience.... staff were extremely attentive, helpful and pleasant. Food was a lot better too I’d have to say.
Delhi Business Lounge
- domestic : was “ok” but food wasn’t great though managed to get a few things to tide me over. - international : better facilities but atrocious food,,,, COLD sliced potatoes and omelette....
brought in a dominos pizza in and was asked why.... so I told them... still they didn’t seem bothered...

It’s business class.... but not as you know it. It was much cheaper, and, perhaps thats the obvious retort - but not so cheap that it couldn’t or shouldn’t be done a lot better than it is.

After arriving at Singapore we waited till all passengers alighted as we had asked for wheel chair. A person came to aircraft and simply said that AI had booked only 2 wheelchairs and those were used for business class so we had to wait 30 minutes for the wheelchair to come.

The air hostess or head of crew - the lady helped my father to walk up to exit of air bridge into main airport floor by carrying his hadn baggae.
The lady who was staff of Changi airport was too good, She got wheel chairs, efficiently handled immigration, baggage etc and dropped us till our van

My flight was supposed to take off at 7:20AM from Kozhikode Airport. I reached the airport at 5:30 and stood in the check-in line. By 5:45 or so, the flight status was changed to Departure at 09:30AM. Later, around 7:30 or so, I got an email saying that the flight was to take off at 10:00AM. By 10:00AM, there was absolute pandemonium created by the Air India staff! Apparently, they told some passengers that the flight was canceled. Needless to say, other passengers go the wind of it through grapevine and not directly from Air India. The situation was totally out of control and Air India staff was grossly untrained to handle the situation. Sometimes, that staff would say people would be accommodated on Jet Airways, some passengers would be taken to Coimbatore and Kochi. Anyway, there was no clear communication from a responsible AI staff. In the meantime the Air India counter was like a zoo with people swarming for want of information. 

The reason for the cancelation was that the flight from Sharjah did not arrive. Obviously, Air India knew that the flight from Sharjah did not take off well in advance. So, why did they not announce the cancelation? This is my second bad experience with Air India in a week. In the previous week, the flight from Mumbai to Kozhikode was delayed by 4 hours.

As I was invited for a conference I did not have much choice in the selection of the flight. I have heard a lot about how good the service in Air India is, about the quality of food and all. But in the past few years there has been many news reports about the bad service, how during mid flight the window pane came out and hit a passenger's head, the rude behaviour of AI crew, etc. The flight I boarded from Delhi was a terrible old machine. It made noise as if we were sitting in a boat. The seats and seat covers were brown in colour as if centuries of dust and murk has settled on it. The flight was quite turbulent and the aged machine added to the woe. We were served peanuts and a glass of coke as appetiser. Who serves salted peanuts as appetiser? The old lady sitting next to me asked to fill her half glass of coke and the staff refused to do so. The food was mediocre and tasteless. The staff was very rude and cold. While nearing Colombo my co-passenger wrote a feedback about her experience. It was sealed and submitted. But after some time one of the staff came and started apologising profusely. It means that they opened the feedback form and read it. He stood there for more than five minutes while the flight was going to land and tried to convince her otherwise. This was my first experience with AI.
While on the return flight the flight had a delayed start. We reached Chennai with a little time to catch our connecting flight. During the long transit and security check the old passengers were asked to walk for at least half a kilometer. They did not offer them any assistance at all. After reaching the flight an old lady complained about this to the flight staff. She said I am feeling uncomfortable because I had to walk so long. There was no assistance. Instead of offering an apology the rude staff said if you are feeling uncomfortable then you should not travel on this flight. We can ask you to deboard. I was shocked by this arrogance and audacity of that guy. They should realise that we are paying for their service. They are here to assist us especially the senior citizens. Many times things go wrong but then a sensitive conversation would matter a lot. These people think that they are in govt service so they will be protected and can do anything. So I have decided to avoid AI at any cost. I am not saying that other private flights are better. But at least there is some pretension that we are the customers. Indigo is another such private company whose staff and crew have developed this arrogance. It is slowly creeping in. A major reforms in the behaviour of flight crew and staff is required."

Air india is a scam, do not buy these tickets; they do not respect people especially women and ill treat and harass the passengers!"

It may not be an Emirates when it comes to.the presentation and ambience but it definitely is worth every penny you pay.

And back 
Mad-Del-bom-goi 

On every other instance I’ve been indifferent to the service from Air India as there was really no differentiator
But each segment I took, the clear differentiator was service.. maybe it was business class factor, maybe lower number of people sitting in the B class .. I don’t know .. I know we received spectacular assistance and service from the staff

Service- 5
Food- 3.5 (salad on Madrid flight, mind blowing!)
Seats- 4
Cleanliness-4
Lounge-3 (food in lounge was a let down, this was perhaps the Delhi airport small things like give the wifi password when the guest comes to the lounge would reduce the guest effort to go to counter again. Finding the lounge was inconvenient, very inconvenient.. could be mentioned when tickets were being handed over)

We faced a ticket issue at the Madrid airport.. our agent goofed up and while there was a valid ticket, it wasn’t blocked and my friend would have to stand in various queues if the Air India manager at Madrid Baragas airport had not stepped up and worked with her team to support. I should have written her name, a lady from Calcutta she is and been there on a stint in Madrid... she was professional and above all kind. She clearly emphasised the inconvenience we would go thru and we had paid a bomb for convenience. She made it right for us

Madrid to Delhi they gave us a small toiletry pack that was really cool and lovely. Mine fell between the seats and I could not recover it .. poor me but the hostess offered a replacement if I wanted another

The crew uniformly did a great job

Also Air India... Respect! I’ve often been party to the jest we make of some of the air India staff, we’re so awkwardly cliched to expect young good looking guys and girls and I apologise for my poor and little thinking. These are men and women who have chosen a career and air india chose to allow them the career for giving their best years to the flights.. their best years are even now maybe a few gray hair but the service offered by everyone of them, respect and gratitude 

Ill only hope the service remains and I’ll be happy to board again"

However; this time when I herd that they started operating non-stop flight from Washington-Dulles airport, I thought to give them Chance once more. It was a disappointing experience from the time of check in. I had preselected seats in my flights (aisle), and the booking clerk changed my seats to the middle without my consent. After reaching Kochi, I contacted the Airline by email and yet to get a response. After all, the carrier is fully owned by the Indian Government, and the employees have the attitude that nobody can fire them, and they will get their salary, ""no matter what."" The meals are unpalatable, and I have seen during the flight passengers are running to the Pantry for their needs. In a nutshell; avoid the airline at any cost."

The lounge facilities in Birmingham are not good and very basic,perhaps the lowest that you would see.

On return the ground services were good and the lounge is good (not excellent) but sadly the entertainment system was down in the aircraft and even the Captain could not get it to work! The meals were good and air hostesses polite and courteous.

DO NOT PLACE THE GLASSES ON ARM REST IF THEY DROP DOWN ON THE SIDE OF SEAT,IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM

one change of flight is free after completing first leg of journey. There are many fare categories within business class,beware!

The non stop journey to Delhi is convenient from Birmingham and previous experiences in the business class with same airline have been better.

When I flew to Delhi, I did not have my baggage! How so? After all, I flew on the same plane on the route Mangalore - Mumbai - Delhi! Why did you unload my luggage in another plane ??? Next: during the flight from Mumbai to Delhi, the flight attendant urged me and other passengers to change seats to other places, at the emergency exit. But I specially reserved this place earlier in Moscow! The steward explained his actions, ostensibly, that the family is flying and they need to be in place all together. But, in fact, the reason was different. This family bought tickets with more spacious seats at the emergency exit, for children, but they could not function in emergency conditions, adults do all nessesary things. Therefore, they began to change seats for children. Why did the steward lie about the reasons for the change of seats? Who is to blame for the situation? The company sold tickets to half of the family at the emergency exit, and, half in another place, but did not explain to them who should sit at the emergency exit. This caused an unpleasant process of moving other passengers, who are not to blame for the problem created by the company. My luggage arrived in Delhi with a delay of almost 2 hours, after my arrival. Thank God, my flight to Moscow was at night, but still, the company Air India, delayed flights, made me jittery and cause discomfort, only for one flight!"

The cost was also similar to most low cost airlines maybe 30mins extra travel time. 
But this included two meals, snacks when we traveled from Gauhwathi to Kolkata and dinner when we traveled from Kokalta to Bengluaru .

Also, it took them 3,5 hours to get me a room at Delhi airport due to they own fault (delayed flight) and when I eventually got my room, I had to share with a complete stranger. Absolutely horrible airline. Buns provided during snack time were cold and day old. On positive side it was cheap-ish.... PS. Flight was CPH-DEL-BKK and back in March/April 2018"

The in-flight experience was neither very good nor very bad. The leg room and the seat comfort was below average if compared with other operators.
The flight was not much clean as the floor had visible signs of dust and left overs from the previous flight.
The food offered during the flight tasty though but with very less serving portion.

The flight flew on time from Bengaluru and landed before time in Delhi, gaining an extra star for this.
The in-flight crew was very active and friendly with the passengers.
A total of 3 out of 5 stars."

Children were so nervous and shouting rather screaming. I dont' know but it looked that the pilot was inexperienced. I can not forget this experience. I am flying since 1981, but this experience was so unique in terms of frightening that I can not forget. I personally feel that it should be investigated."

Out of all 4 flights every single one of them were delayed with no explanation or apologies!! Making it nearly 24 hours to get to our destination both ways. When we questioned the counter staff they never gave an honest answer. With 3 kids 4 and under it’s hard when you don’t know how long you are stuck there for.

We had booked a children’s menu for our 3 little ones which they didn’t have and said all they had was the regular menu this was too spicy for them so they ended up having to eat a roll for all 4 flights!! When we queried if we could have more they said they didn’t have any extra’s. No extra snacks or anything. Wasn’t too happy with the kids having to live on 2 rolls and a few pieces of soft fruit in nearly 24 hours!

The journey back was the same for them although it was a night flight so they slept the majority of it luckily.  

The staff were rude and not very helpful. He planes were dirty,  the service was really bad and so was the food. Def wouldn’t fly with them again. When we complained they blamed us for not booking correctly!!! We have flown many times before with no issues yet we were wrong this time!! Never again would we use them. We would rather pay extra to fly with another airline.

I and my wife - both senior citizens, travelled on this flight (AI 103) in October 2017 to visit our daughter and son-in-law working in Arlington.
It was a very good experience & with the time difference between India and the USA, it appeared that we reached our destination overnight. In fact we left Delhi @ 01:15 AM & reached Washington @ 07:15 AM - a flight time of about 16 hours only.

All attempts to change the seats during web check-in and at the check-in counter at the airport failed. After we were comfortably seated some security staff in Madrid refused to allow us to take these seats due to our age, citing European Union regulations. The Air India cabin staff obviously had no say in this matter. Fortunately for us there were many vacant seats in the flight and we had no difficulty in shifting. My question is - how come Air India was ignorant of the existing rules of a country where they are sending 3 flights a week and allot these seats to senior citizens? I view this as an absolutely callous attitude of Air India. Incidentally, our onward journey seats were also 11B and 11C though we travelled without any issue!! I must add that we are not particularly fascinated by seats in Row 11 which are supposed to be prime seats, with extra charges of 30-40 Euro as per the information on Air India web site."

Did not pay close enough attention to their specifications which is my fault). They told me as I was boarding that my bag was detained and had to go through clearance.  They would not give me any more information and ushered me onto the flight.  When I got in, I had to go through a long process of ‘requesting my baggage be cleared’ - they told me it would be in the next day because there were no more flights that day.  (Why they could not have originally just taken out the battery when checking my bag the first time is beyond me).  I call the next day - it is still being processed, it will be in tomorrow. No apology, no explanation, nothing.  The next day, the same thing.  I have yet to receive my bag, my trip is now delayed (flights canceled, plans changed) because they will not release my bag.  It is a battery charger, my bag is easily packed, it should have been removed within minutes and sent along to me.  The unorganization and sheer stupidity this airline exhibits is beyond any country’s standards.  It’s absolutely not worth it - do not fly Air India. It may ruin your entire trip."

However, we were notified in advance and left for the airport accordingly. Onboard service was surprisingly good, very courteous and polite Cabin Crew. The aircraft was an ageing A319, interior was quite unkept. However, leg space and comfort overall was perfect, I'd say much better than the other Indian carriers.
MAA-BOM AI672 flight was 20 minutes delayed, however inflight service was wonderful once again (something that is just not expected from AI these days), aircraft interiors again quite dirty, but I guess we can't have it all. Overall a surprisingly decent experience."

Luggage took forever to arrive at Calcutta airport - nearly 50 min after arrival. Boarding process was a little better than a train. Horrible snack, no hot beverage and indifferent service. Dirty toilet but ok interiors. Overall, take Air India only if the fares are cheaper than the rest and if you dont have a deadline and if you have excess baggage."

Hence i chose Air India, since it is a Star Alliance member and it would benefit me as a Gold card member of Star Alliance (Lufthansa).

Check-in was smooth - at a dedicated Star Alliance Gold counter and i was provided with a lounge card to the GVK East lounge. It's an excellent lounge and has great food.

Boarding was also smooth.

Unfortunately, the cabin was warm upon boarding and it became worse with all passengers finally seated in place. The cabin crew gave all possible excuses oh high temperature, humidity, ""as soon as we take off it will become fine...."", etc.

The cabin crew let's the entire airline down in my opinion. They are full of excuses and probably have been trained to say these things to avoid handling these situations in a better way.

Although i had received a Priority tag on my bag, it arrived almost last on the baggage belt ! So, basically there was no priority baggage handling.

Overall, it is the only Indian carrier with such a good connectivity network, but with a very very average service."

I was booked on an evening flight to Chennai and the Air India one was the most convenient time. When I got on board I was immediately struck by a deep red twisty designed carpet I last saw the Like of on a film where people used words like ‘groovy daddy-o’ and had people like Telly Savalas in it when they were young. 

I then saw the Business Class seats, a deep (from aged dirt) yellow and gold diamond pattern with a beige (once darker brown) leather headrests. I sat down and to my surprise they were quite comfy...most of the spring in them went years ago I imagine.

The air stewards were great and really helpful although there was a problem with some of the lights in the cabin and after trying to fix it using their control screen in the gantry one of the stewards resorted to whacking the light in the cabin repeatedly much to the bemusement of the passengers. Sadly, hitting it didn’t work so it got left not working.

When the food came out it was amazing, well amazingly bad. A carrot salad sandwich with no crusts and a piece of fruit cake, with one piece of fruit in it. All kept fresh under thick high tensile cellophane.

The flight itself was ok, just great fun to watch the Steward who clearly modelled himself on the Fonz from Happy Days (well we were temporarily back in the 70’s) and was soooo smooth in everything he did. He checked his hair more often than he checked if we had our seatbelts on, but he was harmless enough.

All in all a fab and wayout experience, next time, I might just leave the office a bit earlier..."

The flight leaving Kathmandu was 2 hrs late (that happens very often with them, I heard), and not because of bad weather. When we got to New Delhi, 30 minutes before the plane leaves to Colombo in the same terminal, they told us “you missed your plane” in a way like it was my fault. We were 12 in the same situation. I think we could have made it to the other plane, but let’s say we couldn’t. 3 different agents of Air India told us 3 different things in 2 minutes of where to go. We waited to have somebody rebook us on the next flight and for the food and the hotel, as it was already too late to get a flight on the same day. They told us many times “yes, yes, somebody will take care of rebooking you, wait”. When someone from Sri Lankan airline finally came, he said he was waiting for a confirmation from Colombo (at 8 pm in the night ??). Anyways, this part might not be Air India’s fault. 
We finally got our ticket for the next morning flight (boarding at 4h30 am) after more than 3 hours without food or water.
We then had to wait again more than an hour to get the vouchers for the hotel and the food. The hotel is inside the terminal at New Delhi. When we got there we still couldn’t get internet because they were waiting for Air India for the vouchers. No room, no internet. My boyfriend was so pissed that he went back in the terminal to find an Air India agent. It took him more than an hour to find an Air India agent in New Delhi airport who just said “the vouchers are there, there’s nothing I can do”. (When he got back, i just started checking in). The hotel and the meal where ok except that it took me 5 times walking all the way to my room to the reception to have it open. The card keys just didn’t work and they just kept giving me another key which didn’t work. There was no breakfast. So if you have a connection with less than 3 hours with Air India, I suggest you think twice before booking that flight. For Air India, I would have appreciated to have an internet connection (the one in New Delhi airport doesn’t work in international phones and the roaming didn’t work) while you are rebooking us, and faster rebooking and faster communication with the hotel for the vouchers. And I guess I would have appreciated to have a bottle of water or something to have me wait... 
It is possible to make a delayed flight a pleasant experience (it happened with air New Zealand; they waited for me out of the plane with my new boarding pass and 100$ Australians and somebody who took care of everything in 5 minutes). "

Was relaxing in the Business Lounge of Air India post check in and security at 5 am, when suddenly the duty attendant announced the boarding of AI 435.

The return flight departed at 3 pm for Delhi which was experiencing an horrific dust storm. The plane was held waiting for landing conditions to improve and eventually made an attempt to land but needed to abort from a very low altitude. Rather than diverting to another airport the plane after further holding made another attempt to land with passengers petrified and physically ill. This too was aborted and by now passengers were in extreme fear. Eventually the plane was diverted as fuel levels were low. While refuelling and aircraft cleaning anarchy was developing amongst a number of passengers who were demanding that they be allowed to leave the aircraft. The airline staff failed to take a strong position and ongoing debate further delayed our flight continuation.
Once the flight resumed the attendants did little to support the passengers and ensure appropriate flight standards. Their lack of supervision had seats not returned to upright and electronic devices on at takeoff.
The flight finally landed safely at Delhi airport shortly before midnight.
This finally convinces me that if travelling on an internal flight in India seek another airline."

We were traveling overseas and our return flight was to land in Delhi. We had to take a connecting flight to Mumbai. Knowing that there can be delays and uncertainty of time taken at immigration etc., I had kept a safe cushion and booked us on the 2100 Air India flight from Delhi to Mumbai.
Luckily our international flight was ahead of time and immigration was double quick, so we were done by 1700…which left us with a four hour wait at Delhi airport. We tried getting an earlier flight to Mumbai and spoke to just about everyone in Air India at the international airport to put us on any earlier flight (which there were enough of). We were willing to pay the fee for ticket change.. but end of the day the result was nada and we ended up wasting 4 hours at the airport and taking our scheduled 2100 flight that (as expected) landed late in Mumbai etc. etc.

Now, I fully appreciate that they were well within their rights to not do the ticket change but I have two points:
1) During my management course we were taught that a flight seat (apart from a hotel room) is the most perishable of commodities. So a if a customer is asking for an earlier flight (and you have seats available) why would you not make that sale and have the option of selling the three extra seats that are now available for the later flight?
2) While there can be ten reasons for NOT changing the flight for a customer, could no one in Air India find ONE reason to actually do it??

I was not disgruntled, just disappointed at the attitude. Also made it clear to me as to why the enterprise is in the state that it is in and is up for sale… they have simply not come to terms with the changing scenario and continued to operate in their old, dated ways.
Sad…but true!"

Earlier there was another Airline also known as Indian Airlines, which used to look after the domestic needs of the country. Even when there were no private Airlines, only Indian Airlines used to ply on the domestic routes. However, Air India used to carry passengers from International Airports to International Airports within the country in the late nights. Once there was a government order that the government officers would only fly by Indian Airlines and the Air India. These are the antique pieces of information which the young generation might not know. I remember to have travelled from Ranchi to Patna with a fare of Rs.240/- only in 1984 by Indian Airlines. 
Oh! I am to review my journey from New Delhi to Indore. The official Airline has prime locations at the Airport in Terminal 3 and boasts of best services. I had to wait hardly for about 15 minutes to get my boarding pass and the seat was allotted only in the 17th row in spite of my repeated requests. This is the problem with this Airline. The front rows are kept vacant for the Parliamentarian's and high official's requisitions till the last time and even the early birds are allotted the last rows. This is though objectionable, but this government Airline cannot afford to ignore the VVIPs requests who are forced to travel on short notices. So I travelled by sitting in the 17th row. 
The security as usual takes some time in spite of the best efficiency of the CISF, and then I reached the Air India gate. Because after missing a few flights now I reach always before 2 hours so I need some reading material. The waiting was made less tiring by my mobile. Whenever I have to sit at the Airports I read my pending mails in the mobile, because that is the only time when I can concentrate on my own thoughts. So I boarded the plane after waiting for about 80 minutes which was on time. 
The crew in Air India are not that young due to the personnel policy of this government Airline, so apparently they are also not very dedicated to their jobs as you find in the private Airlines. The Air India always serves food on board by charging bills in the tickets itself. Though the food was not enough, but because it was the lunch time so I had to grub something. Normally the taste of food of Air India is always better than others, so it was good this time also. But by the time we finished our food the turbulence started and it continued till the time of landing at Indore Airport. The pilots were experienced, so the flight landed with a little jerk and we made a move to collect our bags after using the bus facility. The bags did not keep us waiting and we finally came out of the Indore Airport. This was my first visit after March 2008 to Indore, but much had changed at the Airport and the town in itself as it has been ranked first in cleanliness in the country, so that effect was visible at the Airport also, thanks to the authorities.
So I can say that this was a comfortable flight in a government Airline. All the very best to them."

The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section.  My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours.  She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”.  Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other oriental looking air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break.  These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome.  A demand for change of seats was declined too.  This airline is by far a third world airline proving true to its roots.  The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment.  If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with air India and will never do so in the future.

Further, hydraulic aero bridge was connected to the aircraft which saved our time substantially. 

But yes, Air India aircraft cleaning officials should stay more alert and vigilant as a mid-sized insect travelled with us from New Delhi to Indore and was going to Mumbai from there. It stayed glued to the window as it might be experiencing the beauty of the skies for the first time or it might be in a state of shock. I could not comprehend its expressions as it was completely still and static, but I must say that the officials responsible for the cleaning of the aircrafts' must stay more cautious as it does not reflect a great impression.

We were served packed biscuits and water bottle. I think expecting hot snacks, tea/coffee isn't too much for a full-service airline charging 8000 per head for the 45min trip. However, there is no other choice as they are the only airline flying this route."

Announcements were being meticulously made by Jet Airways for everything, whereas Air India ground staff were orally calling out. Regarding on-flight meal/snacks, we were offered bottled water and snack packet (cold kachori, balushahi, cheese sandwich and Frooti). I returned using Jet Airways and were served hot snacks (piece of pizza, halwa) and hot tea/coffee along with water."

Truly royal experience, Air India operates the Dreamliner 787 on this sector. Service was impeccable, on time departure and arrival, excellent food and in flight entertainment. I found all the negatives said about this airline to be false as I had a similar pleasant experience on my return trip as well"

I used a different airline to get to Copenhagen so I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Air India's quality of customer service is far superior compared to other airlines I have flown with in the past.  The cabin crew were very friendly and professional and dealt with all our requests promptly and politely.

I thoroughly enjoyed the onboard meal provided and would definitely recommend Air India for friends and family."

The first flight from London Heathrow to Delhi was virtually empty (around 25 people on the flight) – the staff were friendly, and our first meal came within 15 minutes of taking off. Everyone on board was also able to have a row of seats to themselves, and the drinks after meal service was self-serve. Wine / whisky and soft drinks were available along with beer.  

The return flight from Delhi to London Heathrow was a full flight, and the service was not very good. We only received one meal during the 9 hour flight and the air hostesses seemed to be more interested in eating their meals at the back of the plane than serving anyone on board. 

Despite this I would recommend the airline, due to the first flight experience and competitive cost."

Service is good, and eventually you may find some newer machines in between, but they are mostly old with a non-functioning entertainment system.
If you need to do changes in the booking, have patience, as you cannot do it online without calling, and the time it takes on the phone is unheard of..."

There was no storage space in row 12 as it's  where the emergency exits are. Idecided I didn't need anything and returned my Samsung Tablet into my bag and stored it above me. I never sleep on a flight but for some very strange reason I fell asleep straight after dinner and had to be woken up just before landing. From Delhi's International airport, I had to connect to a domestic flight immediately and it was while going through security there I noticed that the Tablet had been removed from my bag. Ground staff checked the plane and of course it hadn't been left behind, it had been stolen
 I do not hold air India responsible but they refused to acknowledge my concern and need to report the incident to an official for Insurance purposes. I was directed from Delhi to Jodhpur ground staff however there was absolutely no one at all at Jodhpur Airport. I went to the Air India office in Jodhpur the next day ,they were not interested and referred me .back to Delhi. Once back in Delhi 4 weeks later Delhi Staff said I should raise it with Birmingham since that was my point of origin. Needless to say that was fruitless too. All I wanted was acknowledgment that an incident had occurred. The flight itself was smooth and comfortable."

Staff of some  airlines treats economy class as cattle class. 
However in the case of Air india I had two Distinct experiences while  flying from Mumbai to London and from London back to Mumbai. During my flight AI 131 from Mumbai to London I had an amazing experience and the staff was so pleasant especially the one lady whose name was Nisha. She was exceptionally good and served with a smile throughout the nine hours of the flight.

However, during my return flight from London to Mumbai the staff was terrible they were talking to the passengers very  rudely, the service was just mechanical and there was no personal touch. At one point I was so upset that I walked up to the rear of the plane and ask for the names and told them that i wanted to give feedback. One crew member, a  if you gentleman who is appeared  to be in early 50s asked me whether that the review was going to be good or bad. I said it’s going to be bad. He said please go to your seat and I’ll come and give you the names and as I expected he never came up to give the names. 
If any air india official is reading this must take to task the crew of AI 130 from London to mumbai on 5th May 2018."

But we were pleasantly surprised with the service provided by Air India. The checkin process was flawless, boarding process was smooth, there was some technical snag but rectified quickly and we had a delicious snack onboard. I guess private airlines should learn something. Worst of all was Indigo all these day with pathetic in cabin services. Anyways, the entire flight journey was very smooth and we are really looking forward for our journey with Air India within India or abroad. Kudos to the staff."

The flight took off late as usual and when we landed in Mumbai the flight to Ahmedabad was cancelled. When I arrived at the Air India desk, the great customer services executives asks me where I would like to fly? To Jaipur or Goa? I was shocked as I had to reach Ahmedabad and she had no issue in asking where I would like to go. They could not arrange any arrangements except for the late evening flight to Ahmedabad. Also they did not organize a hotel to accomodate a passenger whose flight was cancelled by the Airline itself. I believe Air India need to understand the importance of customer service and in this way it would be better that it is managed by a private company. Pathetic is the word for their service levels."

Stupid system they allocated me and husband in seperate row  even with same booking reference number. When we called customer service they asked us to pay a fee to be able to sit together and offered seperated by aisle. Spent hours on phone to convince stupid non english speaking operators to manage a complaint. This airline should really work on making it right for its customers. Seats are terrible felt like in local train, special meal ordered not offered. If you cannot provide a service do not offer it. Guys seriously avoid at any cost! Tray holder had curry from last flight and was disgusting. Washroom were dirty as well.

Indigo Airline is much better than Air India... Excellent customer service...service delivery with quality and dedication to improve on its weaknesses to reach beyond customer experience.

If you are a British passport holder non Indian and would like to have a pleasant and comfortable journey avoid Air India..."

Initially, there was a lot of confusion because of we did not get a travel confirmation from Travelocity after booking our flight. Travelocity was not able to help us so a representative from our hotel called Air India and confirmed we were booked to fly that evening. After arriving at Kochi International, a representative from Air India was very helpful and check-in was fairly easy. The plane was clean and comfortable."

The service was satisfactory, although its not a world class airline. They lack professionalism in them. It would rate 5/10. I may never fly with it again, if its not mandatory for me.
Nothing special to recommend about it and they do not even care, mind it. They are on the verge of closing operations soon or someone would buy it.
Bye bye Air India.

But , my friends - As a father of 9 year old daughter who decided to trust his Daughter's first solo flight, all the way from Chennai to Paris via Delhi , i would say- The Airline is awesome. The ground crew { Gayathri & Bhavani to name a few ) were highly supportive , caring and friendly and made my daughter to feel the airport a place to be relaxed and enjoy. They are excellent in handling UNACCOMPANIED MINOR. When my wife asked my daughter about her inflight experience - she narrated  the entire experience in one line "" MOM - THEY TOOK CARE OF ME , BETTER THAN YOU"" 

THE FINAL VERDICT - FOR An UNACCOMPANIED MINOR , I WILL TRUST AIRINDIA FOR SURE 

THANK YOU AIRINDIA - YOU GUYS MADE MY DAUGHTER'S MAIDEN SOLO JOURNEY MEMORABLE

Planes do not appear to be well maintained in cabin areas. In flight staff ignored deteriorating state of toilets
Charged twice for seat reservation and promised refund within 24 hours but took over two weeks after more phone calls.
Found staff to be indifferent and  not in any way customer friendly.
As the national airline of India they appear to operate in a completely opposite manor to our experiences in India."

The flight was delayed and the flight had a passanger in stretcher.Not sure if that is even allowed as there were babies( was travelling with my 9month old)and kid travelling in the flight. The air quality inside the air craft was bad. 

Of all the above, a 4 year old boy fell sick in the air and the boy’s mother was crying coz her son had difficulty breathing. The crew said “ we will land in 2.30hr in Chennai and the take him to emergency”. No empathy for the lady from the team. 

We opted this flight because of their low fare, but now realized a little more money is worth the risk of travelling with this Airlines. If you can avoid flying with this airlines, please do. I will never travelling with air India again."

The personnel at the Rajiv Ghandi airport were keen to help out with my As a patient i needed wheelchair needs. They expeditely provided and ensured I checked in with much ease and comfort. I was escorted all the way to the cabin door of Air India and offered a seat as near to the bathroom and exit facilities as possible. True comfortable service. 
The disappointment came at Indira  Grandin international airport. Every help was given until I needed to be escorted to gate 12 for my exit flight onto Ethiopian Airways.
The friendly helpers for those with special needs suddenly tainted the wonderful experiences. 
After helping us check in , instead of them escorting the patient up to the required gate, they started demanding for payment for facilitating the assistance to special needs travelling patient. I had no money on me.they dumped me at a gate (15) took away the wheel chair and left me immobile. I struggled to get to use the bathroom because I couldn't walk and all wheel chairs had owners holding on to them who could not help out.i thought I was dreaming as the hostility increased, no one wanted to help out. I finally saw one unmanned wheel chair I quickly asked my caregiver to just put me on it and we rushed to the bathroom before we could be told to give back the chair. As we were coming from the bathroom an irate airport worker  took it out of our possession with fury and left us stranded again.
To finally get to gate 12 was a real struggle. Finally one of The drivers of motorised inside cars agreed to drive us to gate 12 but as soon as we reached he demanded payment to take me to my gate.
This experience traumatised me as I was not aware that staff ought to be paid for providing this service. Maybe Air India or airport management should publicly announce by putting up notices at Indira Ghandi airport compelling that all needy persons should pay for this assistance. 
For me this was a hostile treatment and it crawed back the good experience i had with Air India such that i had a low view of a distinguished Airport."
